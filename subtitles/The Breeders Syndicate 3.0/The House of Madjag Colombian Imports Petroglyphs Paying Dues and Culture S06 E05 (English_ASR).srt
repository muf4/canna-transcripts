sneaky YouTube algorithm

[Music]

22
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,539
connected with everything around me

23
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,939
all of a sudden I just started

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,180
questioning everything I'd ever been

25
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,179
told

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,960
you know by the time by the time I got

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,820
high that very first time

28
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,819
when it started to hit me

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,240
and I'm like wow

30
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,708
I got high

31
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,709

[Music]

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,299
love that music

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,460
so first we are going to talk about

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,140
um something that's been going on

36
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,759
in the market you've been paying close

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,500
attention to which is

38
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,359
what's going to happen

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,340
up to

40
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:49,859
and post legalization as it pertains to

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,478
other countries importing uh cannabis to

42
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,399
the United States

43
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,340
and we wanted to talk about some of that

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,680
I know a few years ago I started seeing

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,759
a lot of big graders start moving to

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,320
Colombia

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,759
that's when I first noticed it was about

48
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,798
two or three years ago there was a

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,200
almost a mass Exodus of some of the

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,219
Breeders going down to Colombia and a

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,000
lot of people are trying to import

52
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,259
American strains down to Colombia I know

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,539
Bridget Steve was one of them down there

54
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,239
too Charlie Garcia those guys went down

55
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,878
down to Columbia yeah most of funk told

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,099
me about Charlie in fact Charlie wrote

57
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,259
me too because he was so sad with all

58
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:28,799
the things that had happened at Ace that

59
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:31,859
he decided to just go somewhere noon

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,500
being Spanish he would fit down there so

61
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,300
well oh yeah and I'll bet he I bet he's

62
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,280
digging it in Colombia and I bet they're

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,319
digging him probably treating him like a

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,300
dignitary you know really yeah like

65
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,159
royalty I would I would assume he's been

66
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,080
around forever he's done a lot you know

67
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,519
and and that would be a huge fit down

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
there

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,539
and he knows a lot of people so that

70
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,300
when it comes time to Market

71
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,639
you know he knows how to do that is

72
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,680
Colombia I don't really understand the

73
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,399
Colombian Market as much but is Colombia

74
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,920
as controlled by cartels as say Mexico

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,080
is currently

76
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,419
I don't believe so I think the

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,159
government has stepped in by legalizing

78
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,139
and

79
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,899
they

80
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,419
they monitor everything they I'm sure

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,879
there's money being passed around to see

82
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,958
who gets what licenses because that one

83
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,899
article

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,900
said that there's only

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,340
there was how many I said that there's

86
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,819
only like 16 or six that were allowed to

87
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,840
produce seeds yeah but there was a lot

88
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,560
of

89
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,439
um licenses for Growers yeah 60 or 70.

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,500
so only 10 percent roughly

91
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,598
were allowed to uh produce seeds so

92
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,299
they'll be producing their own down

93
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,000
there and with someone like Charlie or

94
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,280
breeder Steve they'll get the right

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,340
genetics design you know they'll yeah

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,199
and I'm sure that that Charlie's

97
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,439
searching in the

98
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,259
back jungles and Corners to find it's

99
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,000
close to land races as you can oh I'm

100
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,739
sure I mean he's he'd be one of those

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,780
ideal people for Colombia I think

102
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,379
because he understands

103
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,079
um different types of of uh

104
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,579
not just not just strains but types of

105
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,699
strains how they grow in certain

106
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,379
provinces and certain certain elevations

107
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,360
so I think you'd be excellent for that

108
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,100
like like finding a strain and he

109
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,379
understands breeding he understands

110
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,759
working a line acclimating it so I yeah

111
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,279
he's a great person to be down there

112
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,020
doing it I'm kind of shocked that

113
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,819
there's so few people allowed to produce

114
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,879
seeds I don't know that the U.S market

115
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:46,079
has a cap on the number of seed

116
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:48,060
producers uh licenses and stuff

117
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,180
I think it's kind of late if if there is

118
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,418
going to be yeah I mean yeah yeah

119
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,819
there's tens of thousands yeah there's

120
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,698
so much so could they be so brilliant

121
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,819
that they're realizing that the future

122
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,699
for their seeds would be if they're

123
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,399
certain lines like Chiba or

124
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,340
Santa Marta gold and they can regulate

125
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,698
and make sure that the six readers of

126
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,978
seeds really have that so that when they

127
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,160
sell them

128
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,719
um it could be

129
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,639
Thailand's done something similar kind

130
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,800
of as I understand it's something

131
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,439
similar with their Heritage strains with

132
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,300
like the silk squirrel tail the Tiger

133
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,038
Tail snake teeth there's a few other

134
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,280
kinds from Thailand they consider like

135
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,978
Heritage strains however they put a lady

136
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,659
in charge of it named I don't want to

137
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:41,459
say her name a lady in charge of all

138
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,960
this stuff and

139
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,819
um it seems that she doesn't even

140
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,918
understand that most of the ties that

141
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,379
were sold during that era were laotians

142
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,198
so she she's putting out like this big

143
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,360
thing where like almost reparations that

144
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,038
American farmers owe Thai people money

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,960
for growing Thai strains and using them

146
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,180
over the years when in fact they're

147
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,739
probably lay ocean strains so her

148
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,478
bringing this forward will kind of

149
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,400
probably point out that most high

150
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:07,319
strains or laotians and that probably

151
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,879
the Thai is oh reparations to lay oceans

152
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,800
if she keeps pushing it that direction

153
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,079
because she she just doesn't understand

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,639
the culture she doesn't understand the

155
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,359
history of the strains but she's in

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,038
charge of it and I think it's it's

157
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,280
disappointing because I feel like that

158
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,918
happens a lot in corporate Canon America

159
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:28,079
uh obviously in Thailand is is that you

160
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,339
have corporate money coming in and

161
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,978
corporate money

162
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,538
choosing who is to head The Who

163
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:37,199
spearhead these

164
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:39,779
these campaigns and most of the time the

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,939
people with the money and incorporations

166
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,099
do not have access to the people who

167
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:47,160
have the knowledge or have been keeping

168
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,840
this clandestine stuff you know uh

169
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,220
keeping track of it the archivists they

170
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:52,500
just don't have access to these people

171
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,300
or even know so

172
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,978
they wait to be approached by these

173
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,259
people who tell them I am that person

174
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:00,899
and it almost I almost feel like they do

175
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,520
they have no way to check do checks and

176
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:04,739
balances on if this person's full of it

177
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,379
or not and it's almost like a to me it

178
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,660
feels random on who they choose like uh

179
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,339
you're gonna be the lady you know like

180
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,280
you're going to be the guy to represent

181
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:16,739
it and um I know a lot of Thai people or

182
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,239
people in Thailand right now

183
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,579
um that are super interested in land

184
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,280
races and preservation are a little

185
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,258
upset about that because I mean now

186
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,879
she's representing certain strains as

187
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,699
their Heritage strains that may not even

188
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,399
be they could be you know Dutch hybrids

189
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,660
of stuff and they will always be pushed

190
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,159
as their Heritage straight now because

191
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,180
she said so

192
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,819
hmm

193
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,199
yeah it's it's fascinating the politics

194
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,000
that go behind

195
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,740
all this stuff because you never really

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,120
realize how much it's going to affect

197
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,460
potential future written down history

198
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,120
so I found the article from April 12th

199
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:56,818
of 2019. so we're talking two years ago

200
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,500
and it says there's a hundred and twenty

201
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:02,240
six

202
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,819
um companies in Colombia at that time

203
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,199
that's two years ago but only six in

204
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,360
proceeds

205
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,319
oh wow yeah 126 had been cleared to grow

206
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,800
and have

207
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,900
huge but only 16 of those 126 were

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,460
qualified to produce

209
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,159
um cities since these companies are

210
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,739
allowed to register genetics in batches

211
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,660
of 10 at a time and the phytosanitary

212
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,180
tests will mandate them to cultivate a

213
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,158
test batch engage its properties before

214
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,879
it can go to the market or register the

215
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:38,038
genetics several well-known land race

216
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,200
strains will be featured

217
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,939
so they are going to try to do that um

218
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,440
that Heritage strain type thing that's

219
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,720
kind of cool

220
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,500
yeah Santa Marta go

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,060
um

222
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,159
Chiba

223
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,199
black hopefully hopefully they choose

224
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,579
someone like Charlie to spearhead that

225
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,240
that would be cool someone that actually

226
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,240
knows their their business or or not

227
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,860
must have Funk or someone cool you know

228
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,100
I know he's not there but it would be

229
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,139
nice to consult

230
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,339
I'm pretty sure they'll need testers

231
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,879
yeah that's for sure yeah

232
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,820
um

233
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,220
so what do we know about the what do we

234
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,519
know about the political climate in in

235
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,500
Colombia as far as so we talked about a

236
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,459
little bit about cartels in Mexico how

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,919
does this how do you think this

238
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:28,079
interplays with moving the product from

239
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,399
Colombia through Mexico because it's

240
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,899
going to have to pass through Mexico to

241
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,059
get to the US unless it's done on

242
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,980
airplanes right

243
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:36,479
um yeah I guess I guess I I don't know

244
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,700
why I would assume that they can't do it

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,920
on airplanes if it's legal though I'm

246
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,160
still in like that Outlaw mindset like

247
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:48,059
we gotta smuggle it the 747 pack yeah

248
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,699
UPS like the way UPS will pack

249
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:54,000
certain carrier planes you know they own

250
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:57,300
them and use them but that size sure and

251
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,159
then they'll be they'll be perfectly you

252
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,939
know protected you know they'll keep

253
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,778
them

254
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,519
oh I'm sure they may vac seal them I

255
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:06,958
don't think the glass bottle and like

256
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,519
some of the

257
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,018
Boutique companies in Northern

258
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,080
California but they'll definitely

259
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,159
they've learned their lessons over

260
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,160
decades so

261
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:20,219
and they may have some that they ferment

262
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,039
on purpose and help

263
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,660
bring about changes in the Smoke

264
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,838
qualities

265
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:30,539
it'll it's I don't know when it'll be

266
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,519
but once we're federally legal

267
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:34,620
I bet they'll have their lobbyists

268
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,980
already waiting and already had their

269
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,679
plans made they may even right now and

270
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,539
when it happens they'll Rush In And

271
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,819
there'll be all these companies in

272
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,620
America fighting saying we need to have

273
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,600
tariffs we need to have tariffs and stop

274
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,399
them coming in

275
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,860
um so it'll be interesting

276
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,379
Washington DC battle

277
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,940
you know it almost I mean it kind of

278
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,200
would be common sense that a lot of

279
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,640
these companies because we know a few

280
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,620
years ago that a lot of people moved

281
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,159
down there and started doing this that

282
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:09,860
they are I mean these what were once

283
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:12,719
cartels maybe or maybe what is backed by

284
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,639
clandestine money in Colombia and and

285
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,300
Mexico

286
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,699
um

287
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,559
they have way more money than a lot of

288
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,120
the the corporations and it is what I've

289
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,759
been trying to tell people like a lot of

290
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
the the people that are in the US right

291
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,278
now

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,300
um a lot of the major companies let's

293
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:32,899
it's uh for example schmungel schmoys

294
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:36,120
um something like that level of bigness

295
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,500
and they may not have enough money at

296
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,240
all to be able to compete with the

297
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,278
international market I mean that's just

298
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,560
a fact I mean we're not talking you know

299
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,000
the hundreds of millions of millions of

300
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,859
dollars that we have in America to

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,320
invest in some of these cannabis

302
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,480
companies you know we're talking like

303
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,000
billions and trillions of dollars being

304
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,980
invested and a lot of these people look

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,019
at these companies that were started by

306
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,600
actual Growers some into some cases

307
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,179
getting investments from uh you know

308
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,100
doctors lawyers chiropractors that money

309
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,019
is not going to hold any weight when

310
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,420
these guys come in it's they're going to

311
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,940
get crushed because there's no way it

312
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:12,599
did just by simple economics I mean

313
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,459
um

314
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,740
the way it works is you know if someone

315
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,299
has x amount of space and it's 10 times

316
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,039
the space that you have and they can

317
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,599
sell it for pennies on the dollar

318
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,740
compared to what you can afford to sell

319
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,659
it at

320
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,820
and they can afford to take a loss for

321
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:29,759
10 years there's no way to compete

322
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,839
that's just how all capitalist markets

323
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,679
work

324
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,540
um in a new in a new market where

325
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,099
I guess you could say this this is not a

326
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,319
new commodity but it's going to be

327
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,000
considered a commodity in a broader

328
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,579
sense for the for the world term that

329
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,200
people can uh invest in it's going to be

330
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:48,479
a commodity like pork bellies or

331
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,420
anything like that and and when those

332
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,639
come into play it dumps out any mom and

333
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:56,278
pop chance of being able to ever compete

334
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,839
again if I was in charge of a big

335
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,179
cannabis operation in the United States

336
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,940
I definitely have my representatives in

337
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:06,000
Colombia Thailand and tropical areas

338
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,639
right now which I wouldn't doubt

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,379
um if Spain has such a large presence

340
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,200
down there from the people like Charlie

341
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:15,000
that are the Growers then there's they

342
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,740
have friends who own stores and

343
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,839
companies in their countries there's

344
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,360
plenty of millionaires and there's quite

345
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,180
a few billionaires these days

346
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,339
um yeah why not you know it makes more

347
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,759
sense in South America I guess or Mexico

348
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,920
or maybe even Thailand for the cartels

349
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,379
that are doing other things illegally

350
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,139
you know pain and opium and then they

351
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,179
make billions of dollars and now they

352
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,820
can put it into something legal it's

353
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,338
like washing their money it's like it's

354
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,800
beautiful and wanting the money to

355
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,240
retirement so how do you think Mexico is

356
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,338
going to interplay

357
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,200
um in this whole transition I know you

358
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,079
know I mean Mexico is a bit behind

359
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,579
Colombia as far as uh how people are set

360
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,319
up there

361
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:59,879
um the politics are going to be much

362
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,620
different I I don't know how much

363
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,078
different I don't know the level of

364
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,379
political corruption in

365
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:10,500
um Colombia but I'd imagine it's

366
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:13,620
somewhere on in between Mexico and the

367
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,720
us as far as corruption and politics so

368
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,060
I I just wonder with

369
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,879
with the powers and the money that the

370
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:23,219
cartels have in Mexico

371
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,019
how they will

372
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,759
how they will be prepared to enter the

373
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,679
market because with all that land in

374
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,899
Mexico and as cheap as land is in Mexico

375
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,699
I mean it seems like that and the

376
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,078
climate or the determinant factors on

377
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,240
where a person can grow cannabis

378
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,638
essentially on where these Farms will

379
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,560
start popping up around the world

380
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,560
Gustavo Petro

381
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,500
is a former Guerrilla fighter and he is

382
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,778
now the president in Colombia and that

383
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,278
makes a big difference because he's

384
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:52,740
going to

385
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,320
he has a much different view much more

386
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,480
down to earth he's not like the high-end

387
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,220
Only Money person

388
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,839
being yeah

389
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,660
um it says he

390
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,180
is it an economist politician but he was

391
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:09,719
a former Guerrilla fighter and he's been

392
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:13,620
in prison since 2022. yeah Mexico has

393
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,899
too much corruption in Murder yeah

394
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,419
Columbia you need to kidnap capital of

395
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,500
the world but Mexico is far and above it

396
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,120
now

397
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,399
because

398
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,399
I don't know it's just so split into so

399
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,919
many factions when you had only four big

400
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,220
Godfathers and godmothers in Colombia or

401
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,019
five it was very organized but Mexico if

402
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,019
you look at all the cartels

403
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,519
yeah maps that show like 25 different

404
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,198
ones and they're they're trying to

405
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,778
combine and then others are fighting the

406
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,799
others I I think Mexico will lag far

407
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,139
behind

408
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,278
however it's so close to the United

409
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,919
States

410
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,379
that will have a spillover beneficial

411
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,958
effect for them just like think

412
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:58,078
automobiles everything was Ford and

413
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,838
Chevy and then suddenly Toyota and all

414
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,419
these other countries I mean German okay

415
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,940
Volkswagen was always here too and BMW I

416
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,099
guess but suddenly

417
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,019
when the Imports started flooding to the

418
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,959
United States they came in with some

419
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,820
great quality and stole away a lot of

420
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,799
the market and now they've been playing

421
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,300
catch-up for years for it in the Chevy

422
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,698
yeah

423
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:23,099
with electrifying it's going to be

424
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:25,979
interesting because Tesla kind of broke

425
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,600
the ground but now there's companies in

426
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,300
China that make electric cars that are

427
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,699
seven thousand dollars yeah it's gonna

428
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:35,338
be hard to compete with that even if we

429
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,258
tear fit 100 14

430
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,399
000 for an electric car just to use in

431
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,159
your neighborhood and around shopping

432
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,458
and stuff yeah those will sell like

433
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,919
crazy oh yeah yeah affordable affordable

434
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,719
electric yeah that'd be insane I mean

435
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,039
you know what's funny is uh you know I

436
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,440
collect a lot of different things that

437
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,360
I've talked about and in the over the

438
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,980
years I've watched the guitar Market

439
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,800
specifically

440
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,959
and the knockoffs that have come and how

441
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,359
fast the turnaround time is on Guitar

442
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,698
knockoffs now is literally it went from

443
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,578
probably five or six years from a model

444
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:11,160
being released to where you were able to

445
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:13,500
buy that model

446
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,740
um bootlegged in China pretty easily you

447
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,660
know for 300 to 400 as opposed to ten

448
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,120
thousand or fifteen thousand you know

449
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,140
really that much yeah oh yeah that much

450
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,639
of a difference

451
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,720
um because they're doing like they're

452
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,780
doing like Custom Shop like like artist

453
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,120
Edition versions like perfect replicas

454
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,440
that you can get and sell for 500 bucks

455
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,479
because they're doing it in Mass but

456
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,038
they're doing it so good

457
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,319
um and now they're down to they're down

458
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:44,220
to about two months two months after

459
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:48,119
each uh uh line is released for guitar

460
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,798
maker if it's a high selling line

461
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,719
they will have it knocked off in two

462
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,579
months now as opposed to six years

463
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,919
there's no turnaround time whatsoever

464
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:57,178
it's crazy and I'd imagine

465
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,480
um it's like that with a lot of stuff

466
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:03,000
China's able to reproduce and produce on

467
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,860
such a level and on such an affordable

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,679
level that we couldn't even begin to

469
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:09,839
understand over here six cents a gram

470
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,519
production price they're predicting in

471
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,259
Colombia

472
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,119
um I think we're going to see a replay

473
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,419
in the weed Market

474
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:21,058
Mexico could certainly compete in their

475
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,520
more tropical areas like Oaxaca and

476
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,779
Guerrero because people live in the

477
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,359
mountains and they they grow their own

478
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,700
beans and it's a much simpler life like

479
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,699
much of Colombia Colombia has some big

480
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:37,019
cities though and yeah a port on the

481
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,240
Caribbean and a port on the Atlantic so

482
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:41,579
they can ship right from the Atlantic

483
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,460
side right up to LA or San Diego or they

484
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,859
can ship right to Miami from

485
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,759
you know Buenaventura I think it is the

486
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,418
one that's by Santa Marta and it you

487
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,519
know

488
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,960
they could pick up a little Jamaican

489
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,839
along the way you know yeah right

490
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,640
because the Jamaican by the way son do

491
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,980
you do you ever see a country like China

492
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,100
entering the the Cannabis Market based

493
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,599
on culture and religious aspects

494
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:08,480
not for a while

495
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,279
I I don't know

496
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,579
Thailand and look at all of Southeast

497
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,519
Asia you know kalamantan and you know

498
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:19,918
the guys on the forums from Australia

499
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,619
certain people you know Wally duck and

500
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,240

nice and friendly just wonderful

588
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,500
wonderful culture

589
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:09,418
I have a little booklet I got in the

590
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,079
health food store in the

591
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:15,240
early 70s on the whole hunza story and

592
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,879
their diet they eat a lot of apricots

593
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,759
which has a lot of benefits and

594
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,940
they're they don't eat a lot of meat if

595
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,798
they do it's probably goat meat uh yeah

596
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:30,120
lots of yak yeah yeah

597
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:31,980
and hunza Valley until maybe 10 years

598
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,099
ago was very difficult to get to you had

599
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,200
to Trek for A's to get there now I know

600
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,959
there is a road that leads in there

601
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,860
however the people are probably still

602
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,259
just as friendly they called it like the

603
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:49,199
Garden of Eden like it was a paradise

604
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:52,079
hidden and these people lived in Perfect

605
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,659
Harmony and whatever they have

606
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:58,918
um different districts different little

607
00:23:54,659 --> 00:24:02,700
Regional uh voting areas well not even

608
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,400
voting like people in charge that were

609
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,380
voted in by their their tribe because

610
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,419
they were such good people so it was

611
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,240
good good

612
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:14,640
yeah it it I know that um the dude who

613
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,220
went there it was mostly because of um

614
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,600
the whole Shangri-La story like he was

615
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,339
trying to figure out like where where

616
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,099
this was kind of considered or where it

617
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:24,658
was just going in that area and yeah I

618
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,399
if I remember correctly it was either

619
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,260
the Huns of people or

620
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,840
um somewhere close to there where they

621
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:33,599
were saying they're not Muslim so they

622
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:36,119
are looked at as second-hand citizens

623
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,779
not really quite

624
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,019
um

625
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:42,119
they're not given proper representation

626
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,558
in Parliament and Pakistan and stuff

627
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:46,259
like that because they're not a Muslim

628
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,058
culture and yeah I thought that was

629
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:51,720
absolutely fascinating that this little

630
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:54,839
tiny Bastion of like free people exist

631
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,759
in their own little area in Pakistan and

632
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,918
they're just so sweet they seem sweet

633
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,058
and I never been there but they seem

634
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,240
sweet

635
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:05,639
but I was thinking about the uh kogi

636
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,759
people who were all white and they live

637
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,159
in the Santa Martin mountains there's a

638
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,679
a beautiful

639
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:17,159
movie that came out maybe 20 years ago

640
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,380
and it's called Uh message to little

641
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,299
brother I think was the name of it I I

642
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,679
researched this the other day again and

643
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:25,798
it's about an hour and a half long

644
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,000
documentary and you can't go into the

645
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,278
kogi

646
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,919
highest Villages they they have them

647
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,900
blocked on these paths up into the Andes

648
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,179
you can get that far but they won't let

649
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,759
you be on that and wow they have the

650
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,759
right too because it's their land and

651
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,879
they they consider everyone else in the

652
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,519
world like us little brothers and they

653
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,200
were this was in

654
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,119
environmental movie showing how they

655
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,759
have noticed the snow is no longer on

656
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,739
top of Santa Marta there it's the

657
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,319
weather is changing and and it's because

658
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:02,579
of little brother not knowing what he's

659
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:04,740
doing and talking with nature and right

660
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,538
next door is Venezuela and there's parts

661
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:10,019
of Venezuela and then going to Guyana

662
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:12,298
that are un almost unexplored

663
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,879
and then right below that's the upper

664
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:18,720
end of the Amazon

665
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,400
which is also very little unexplored and

666
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,519
fortunately there's people helping the

667
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,159
tribes there maintain their lands and

668
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,139
hold back the

669
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,559
people who chop down the rainforest to

670
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,000
make the palm oil plantations

671
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,859
really

672
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,900
it's amazing

673
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,819
we live in interesting times that's for

674
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,340
sure I

675
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:44,158
I look forward to seeing Santa Marta

676
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:47,038
gold coming in original it would be so

677
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,679
cool or well how can some strength of

678
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:52,019
oaxacan that no one knew existed because

679
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,000
the people there were guarding it yeah

680
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:57,119
became legal and they were no longer

681
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,339
criminals they had friends who were in

682
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,199
the city who knew how to bring it and

683
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:03,298
yeah it'll happen

684
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,400
I I still think that there's a good shot

685
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:07,500
that we have these Colombian Golds and

686
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,480
oaxacans even in the in U.S seed

687
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,058
collections I'm sure you know even even

688
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,179
with Rob Clark and and um

689
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:16,980
and others like that you know uh Watson

690
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm sure they have these old stuff I

691
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,519
mean Watson said a million times that he

692
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,120
has everything that he's ever touched

693
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:26,158
and see stored frozen forever so you

694
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,599
know I I hope that they do bring these

695
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,520
back out and grow them at point of

696
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,379
origin type places you know like grow

697
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,119
them go take it back to Columbia grow to

698
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,820
point of origin bring some of this

699
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,899
natural stuff back that that has been

700
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:39,439
wiped out

701
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:43,259
that'd be cool

702
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:47,100
one 1977 guerreran seed

703
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,658
that a friend found in his desk it's not

704
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:52,558
viable

705
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:55,260
and down the road with the advances in

706
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,418
PCR and DNA and RNA

707
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,579
it's very possible they'll be able to

708
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,880
deconstruct it just by breaking the seed

709
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:05,879
and taking the remnants of whatever's in

710
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,760
there and the genetic code yeah and

711
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,200
re-engineer it uh I don't know if this

712
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,839
is good I think it's because it's

713
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,778
possible you know it's GMO you know so

714
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:18,240
it's very very possible I mean it's it's

715
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,500
not easy like it shouldn't imply that

716
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,480
it's easy but it's definitely very

717
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,038
possible to take something that has its

718
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,538
genetic code and if they understand the

719
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,240
genetic code and how to reinsert it

720
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:30,119
it'll take years to understand the the

721
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,640
DNA map of cannabis and what goes where

722
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,939
and why but it's at some point they

723
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,679
should be able to to have a um would you

724
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,320
call that like a blank canvas type seed

725
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,360
that they can inject this code into I I

726
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,658
definitely think that's in our very near

727
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:48,359
future and something like that will be

728
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:51,539
absolutely so important to have

729
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,519
tissue culture yeah it's at a Cutting

730
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:57,058
Edge right now and the company that's

731
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,319
really the most advances in Canada and

732
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:01,918
they recently opened in the United

733
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:04,859
States I contacted them maybe a year two

734
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,919
years ago called them in Canada and they

735
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:10,379
said at this point having a Single Seed

736
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,020
like that it isn't feasible but it's on

737
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,659
its way and they feel very confident

738
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:18,658
that they will be able to take a seat

739
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,840
like you said and

740
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:23,700
somehow take what's left in it and

741
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,038
inject it into tissue culture and then

742
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,740
grow it again and then

743
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:31,319
cross it and make new seeds of the exact

744
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,759
same string so

745
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:34,859
hmm

746
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,038
I think it's not too far out

747
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:41,519
no I don't think so at all Kerry Mullis

748
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:45,359
is the cool guy he was a surfer too who

749
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:48,538
invented PCR basically and oh really and

750
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:51,898
he died just a few years ago

751
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:55,558
he wrote a really cool book that I have

752
00:29:51,898 --> 00:30:00,898
and he did a lot of acid when he was in

753
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:04,139
college and he more or less saw the RNA

754
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:07,379
helix or whatever on acid and that's

755
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,860
what allowed him to then make the final

756
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,820
steps and make PCR real and he worked

757
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:17,579
for a company at the time so they got

758
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:20,700
the got the patent for it

759
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:23,699
he got the Nobel Prize of chemistry that

760
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,500
Year by the way and his friend said you

761
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,019
should just quit your job and then do it

762
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,159
on the outside and he estimated it would

763
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,139
be worth

764
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,640
this is 20 years ago when you wrote this

765
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,259
book I believe he said it would have

766
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,720
been worth about a quarter billion

767
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:38,819
dollars that oh I'm sure and today be

768
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,798
worth probably 20 billion dollars you

769
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:45,480
know because PCR is used in everything

770
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,339
yeah that's how it goes when you work

771
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,339
for a company they own you and they own

772
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:52,019
your they own your soul all these books

773
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:56,099
are non-fiction almost every single one

774
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:57,599
I have probably 40 50 fiction books but

775
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,058
yeah

776
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,339
and now with the internet I can skip

777
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:04,038
most of these books however there's

778
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:06,538
still my friends

779
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:09,359
right I can't let go of this stuff like

780
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:11,038
every move that I do is insane mostly

781
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,199
because of my book collection it's

782
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,480
insane it's heavy there's so many boxes

783
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,919
of books but and I know a lot of these

784
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,019
are online but like at the same time

785
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,278
there's a lot that aren't you know and

786
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,740
there's the ones I've been trying to

787
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:25,679
scan in and get out there for people

788
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,440
because I really have this this fervent

789
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,140
belief that like in order for us all to

790
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,460
progress and get at the level to where I

791
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,659
wish people were when it comes to

792
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,759
breeding and cannabis breeding and

793
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,559
taking it seriously we all have to be

794
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,898
have access to the same information and

795
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,398
be on the same playing field to have you

796
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,038
know expectations of people to put in

797
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:45,778
the work and to know what's what so if

798
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,519
I'm not making that available and I have

799
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,960
the resources too then I'm part of the

800
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,379
problem that's the way I look at it it's

801
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,840
weird but yeah so I I'm determined to

802
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,460
get it all scanned I had 10 feet of

803
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,339
National Geographics at one point

804
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,038
because my grandfather gave me a

805
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:05,339
subscription when I was nine years old

806
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:07,500
and for the next 15 years and then when

807
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,418
he died a friend of mine picked up where

808
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,359
he left off and kept sending them to me

809
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:15,960
but once it went digital and I realized

810
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:19,139
you can search every copy yeah or what I

811
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:24,079
need in my life I gave mine to the Boys

812
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:26,220
At Girls Clubs and it was 600 pounds

813
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,898
and I was so happy to give them away

814
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,538
because they would use them to cut out

815
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,678
photos and yeah yeah collages or do

816
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:33,839
whatever they're doing in their class

817
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,820
and that was fine

818
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,099
I did the best

819
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:40,678
but um now in High Times that's a

820
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,839
different story I'm give those to the

821
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,919
Boys and Girls Club

822
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,480
[Laughter]

823
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,360
definitely going to hold on to those

824
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,140
yeah you need to those are special I

825
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,639
mean

826
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,679
share them with people like you and

827
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,320
other friends yeah

828
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:58,620
like since since high times has put the

829
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:01,379
whole archive online like I have several

830
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:04,079
and but I still find myself picking them

831
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,059
up every time that I see them for

832
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,038
whatever and I'm like man I know I can

833
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:10,740
just go access it online but there's

834
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,898
something about having a hard copy from

835
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,778
the 70s being able to smell it and flip

836
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:18,000
the pages and re there's something about

837
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:20,700
that that I'll never be able to walk

838
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,940
away from smell of books the feel of

839
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:27,360
books also

840
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,580
I underlined I I'm not keeping a book so

841
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,439
that it'll be valuable later unless it's

842
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:35,220
one of the ones I collected as first

843
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:39,179
editions so I index my books and I open

844
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:41,778
the front page and it's got my index

845
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,778
and

846
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:47,220
this is just a small one where I you

847
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,019
know I wrote that many things

848
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:55,319
like page 91 is about shin splints page

849
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:58,019
it's about ligaments and yeah

850
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:00,319
it's just that's what the beauty of

851
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,319
books

852
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,119
you know I never um

853
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,059
I've never really taken notes in books

854
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:12,960
but I had a uh or notes on books period

855
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:15,119
I always memorized what I could and I I

856
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,918
when I was doing a lot of UFO research I

857
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,800
ran into a guy that just blew my mind

858
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,838
because every single book he had a long

859
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,700
list of everything he had ever read

860
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,199
about it and and he'd be like have you

861
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,460
read this book no here here's my notes

862
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,739
and I'd be able to read it real fast and

863
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,480
I was like this is so useful if I would

864
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,638
have done this for every book that I've

865
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,179
ever read I could be helping a lot of

866
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,159
people like really fast yeah so now I'm

867
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:41,159
making a habit to do stuff like that to

868
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:44,460
make notes to you know

869
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,099
well I think it's super important

870
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,960
probably the best book on it's called

871
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:51,419
The Rocks begin to speak

872
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,519
and it's by Levan Martino and about

873
00:34:51,418 --> 00:35:00,358
petroglyphs yes and but this guy

874
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:02,719
um he was raised on

875
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:02,719
his

876
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:06,838
his part native American and he was

877
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,260
raised

878
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,259
and

879
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,019
this is how I index my books oh wow you

880
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,439
know

881
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:23,039
all the all the pages that have

882
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,820
things word order Clarity you know like

883
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,820
yeah

884
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:30,598
a lot of archaeologists thinks he's full

885
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,639
of it

886
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,640
he's no longer alive

887
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:39,719
however he was the first to start

888
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:43,819
like he said rocks broke the silence and

889
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:46,439
I've used his techniques personally in

890
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:48,838
even a Mad Jack Cannon there's lots of

891
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,820
petroglyphs and yeah

892
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,679
there's one that's very Sim simple

893
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,300
that's just a circle with a dot in the

894
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:55,199
middle of it and it means something

895
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,519
there

896
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,219
and

897
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,659
you see this on the Rock and he said he

898
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,078
walked around the Boulder and on the

899
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:05,819
back side there was a spring

900
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,579
wow they had

901
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,160
anyone in it didn't matter what language

902
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:14,240
you spoke they all spoke sign language

903
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:19,139
or Rock writing language

904
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:20,578
and it's it's incredible I and if you go

905
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:22,199
to other countries like Central America

906
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:25,940
South America

907
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:29,159
Asia there's petrobus or you know

908
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,200
hieroglyphs all the glyphs in the world

909
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,699
um it's just wonderful to me I think

910
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,960
it's amazing there's stuff like that to

911
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:35,699
even be found in the United States

912
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,260
because the United States like when we

913
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:39,419
think about our history we think of it

914
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,359
traditionally being you know 600 500

915
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,519
years old from um the European Conquest

916
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,679
but realistically like like you said

917
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,239
magic there is a beautiful I I've never

918
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,159
seen petroglyphs in person but I can

919
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,199
imagine the energy the

920
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,199
the vibrations around stuff like that

921
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,659
has got to be magical

922
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:00,239
one of my favorites that I've found I

923
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:02,519
think I sent you a link to the nfts I

924
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,098
made because I was

925
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,259
searching when nfts first came out a few

926
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:10,200
years ago it was a big and I searched

927
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,680
openc and wearable and all these sites

928
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:16,919
and no one had done anything with with

929
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:18,960
weed yeah I found one finally one photo

930
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,079
of a of a flower

931
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,139
some guy had posted on openc but yeah I

932
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,560
think all kinds of stuff and wove them

933
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:29,639
together and one of my favorite most

934
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,619
rare

935
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,598
petroglyphs I've ever found with my

936
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,800
first grow partner Doug the second

937
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,338
actually

938
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,780
um

939
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:39,059
showed

940
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,260
men on horseback

941
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:42,599
and

942
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,400
it was early conquistadors because they

943
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,760
have helmets

944
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,460
and it's it's a fairly rare thing to see

945
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,579
there are a few in northern Arizona and

946
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,380
Utah as well but this is

947
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:58,380
not in magic

948
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,059
came in proper but five miles away on

949
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,440
top of a Mesa where it drops off into

950
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:03,779
another Canyon

951
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,220
my friend and I were hiking over to look

952
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,380
over the edge and see these other

953
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:11,639
Canyons we were considering other growth

954
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:14,880
spots and we found this and it's um it's

955
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,699
pretty stunning to see a horse shape and

956
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,260
a guy on it and he's got a helmet and

957
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:21,779
this dates back to the first

958
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,700
conquistadors in the city it's got to be

959
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,740
them documenting seeing these guys come

960
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:27,118
through or like I'm trying to figure out

961
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,699
what they were seeing

962
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,559
in the 1500s since 16s because they

963
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:33,358
conquistors went through Arizona all the

964
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,578
way up to the Hobie reservation they

965
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,380
came also from Santa Fe which was their

966
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,740
Capital at the time

967
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,400
and mogulan was one of the first Spanish

968
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:46,979
Governors so the mogiano's

969
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,200
Juan Ignacio Flores moyon

970
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,380
no I didn't know that

971
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:55,319
yep he was it's for four years in 16

972
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,260
like 10 or something he was the governor

973
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,619
okay yeah and you can see they're on

974
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,900
horses clearly and their human humanoid

975
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,579
forms and they all have

976
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,880
headdresses on

977
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:11,359
and that the horse was introduced as you

978
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,980
know by conquistadors to North America

979
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,838
and

980
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,039
they were

981
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:18,299
stolen many times I don't think they

982
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,639
were traded that often because they're

983
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,460
too valuable in the early days but

984
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,679
Native Americans got some and then the

985
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,780
Plains Indians I mean they were there

986
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,179
was hunt hundreds there's tens of

987
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,859
thousands of wild horses at one point

988
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:33,179
you know just like there were millions

989
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:35,519
of Buffalo

990
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:37,618
and they were the the main ones but to

991
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,259
go over rough Terrain in the west the

992
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:42,180
conquistors yeah

993
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,180
they don't show up in many petroglyphs

994
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:46,019
the books that no and this one is

995
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:48,719
beautiful

996
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,579
yeah it's almost like a freeze frame of

997
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,959
of one of them talking like looking back

998
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:53,820
and talking to one of his other people

999
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,800
like that they you know what I mean like

1000
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,960
giving them orders his hands up

1001
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,820
directing there's

1002
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,880
three clear ones

1003
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,160
yeah marching and then below that at the

1004
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,700
back left and looks like another human

1005
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:11,879
feature like he's on a horse perhaps too

1006
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:13,500
or he's falling off and then below it's

1007
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,539
difficult to see I have the larger

1008
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,699
version that shows this whole Boulder

1009
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:19,380
this section you're looking at here is

1010
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:21,239
about two feet wide

1011
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,640
and wow

1012
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,379
well three feet wide and two feet tall

1013
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,440
this

1014
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,960
photo is but each of those horses

1015
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,139
petroglyphs are about I'd say eight

1016
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,858
inches tall maybe ten wow yeah when we

1017
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:39,179
saw that we were like oh my gosh because

1018
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:41,699
you know

1019
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:43,618
they're not crazy documented in any

1020
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:46,319
Petroglyph books this picture that

1021
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,640
you've taken no and I've been wanting to

1022
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,338
go

1023
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:52,440
um get with my friends at Coconino

1024
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:55,460
National Forest

1025
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,139
but I've known them for 40 years the

1026
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,300
archaeologists there there's a new head

1027
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:03,239
archaeologist Peter pillis was the

1028
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,800
previous archaeologist and

1029
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:07,679
he

1030
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,720
loved petrobless too

1031
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,539
there's two huge sites outside of Sedona

1032
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:16,078
honaki and palatki palatki's open to the

1033
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,639
public honakis uh where tours go and

1034
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,800
they walk you through and they describe

1035
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,199
stuff and Peter came down once and gave

1036
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,000
a three-hour class that I was fortunate

1037
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:26,759
enough to be a part of with three other

1038
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,500
people and oh wow they went over what

1039
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,500
they were saying about stuff and then he

1040
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:35,480
told them if they're full of or not

1041
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,480
and they were 90 totally wrong

1042
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,119
this is the Sean's cave and he said well

1043
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:44,579
actually in the sonawa which means

1044
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,680
without water that's the nickname the

1045
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,440
ancient people of the Verdi dollar he

1046
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:53,338
said there was no no

1047
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,960
documented signs of shamanism at all

1048
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:57,179
oh

1049
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,980
Shaman's cave because of the petroglyphs

1050
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:01,139
that were associated with it so then he

1051
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,579
would go through and then say what was

1052
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:04,440
more likely

1053
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:07,560
um it was an excellent

1054
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,700
and I was I wasn't I had already been a

1055
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:13,320
grower 20 years before I met Peter and

1056
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:14,939
and he uh

1057
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,700
I shared some things with him but I

1058
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,099
never took my Petroglyph book I have all

1059
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:24,179
these and as photos which I've since

1060
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:26,760
digitized as you can tell here yeah

1061
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,659
I was stunned never ever and I've been

1062
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,420
to

1063
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:32,219
newspaper not newspaper rock but this

1064
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,220
big one that's up near the hope you Rez

1065
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:38,219
and other areas

1066
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,219
fascinating

1067
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,179
one of the largest

1068
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:47,219
in northern Arizona is called newspaper

1069
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:49,259
rock and it it was a site that was used

1070
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:51,539
for many years

1071
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,060
people would add to it and add to it and

1072
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:56,480
it was like a newspaper they akined it

1073
00:42:54,059 --> 00:43:00,059
to because it had so much information

1074
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,119
that was obviously packed into the rock

1075
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:05,880
over many decades not just one person

1076
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,019
sat down for two years didn't you

1077
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,720
graffiti

1078
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:13,318
this is this takes to do one of these

1079
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:15,118
figures this is called this patina is

1080
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:17,099
called desert varnish and it appears on

1081
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,318
rocks as they get older certain types

1082
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:21,838
this is volcanic rock and it gets this

1083
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:25,079
brown or blackish patina

1084
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:27,239
and to Peck into it it reveals the real

1085
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,720
color of the lighter Rock underneath

1086
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:33,299
but it takes hours and hours to do one

1087
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:35,399
of these you're using another rock in

1088
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,440
your hand that's hard like maybe a piece

1089
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,400
of granite or something and make a point

1090
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,338
so that you can Peck the design you want

1091
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,220
so yes this might have represented more

1092
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:49,920
than one person leaving their

1093
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:53,039
information over many years it's hard to

1094
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,838
say I yeah I think the top three at

1095
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:55,858
least so the front two here were

1096
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:57,719
probably

1097
00:43:55,858 --> 00:44:00,239
simultaneous

1098
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,299
in one stretch maybe in a maybe they

1099
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,858
spent a week doing this who knows

1100
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,140
you know I just think like the part that

1101
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:09,420
catches me is is the guy in the Middle

1102
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:11,039
with his hand up like director like that

1103
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,980
because it's like it's almost like

1104
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,000
obviously he was the boss

1105
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,199
whoever it was they were portraying him

1106
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,380
as the boss

1107
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,879
he may have had a stick in his hand to

1108
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,880
whip the horse with you know because

1109
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,880
they didn't have oh yeah

1110
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,800
so it may have been they were portraying

1111
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,720
that he had something he was hitting the

1112
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,300
horse to make it go faster so I don't

1113
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,639
know that's true

1114
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,859
but the Spanish used either that would

1115
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,539
be another interesting thing to study

1116
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:40,440
it's definitely put something on his

1117
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:43,019
head

1118
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,800
oh yeah and the guy up front here you

1119
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:48,719
know had these rival tribes in the

1120
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,900
Plains Indians they were lots of

1121
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:54,838
headdresses but that was this late 17s I

1122
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,079
think or maybe mostly in the 1800s these

1123
00:44:54,838 --> 00:45:00,659
are going back to 15s and 1600s when the

1124
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,660
first horses came through in the sonawa

1125
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:06,358
and the mogulan people saw them

1126
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:08,519
yeah passed through and they were just

1127
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:09,960
like what the heck are those yeah yeah

1128
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,699
they didn't even know what horses were

1129
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:16,260
right no no can you imagine

1130
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:18,598
a horse

1131
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,980
and there's humans on top of them just

1132
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:23,160
riding them around

1133
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:25,139
wearing armor and helmets and because

1134
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:28,440
they were worried about getting shot by

1135
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:30,659
arrows yeah how quickly though like the

1136
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,000
Plains Indians adapted to be able to to

1137
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:34,980
or Native Americans were adapted to be

1138
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,519
able to ride horses and became very

1139
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:40,920
proficient Horsemen bareback too yeah

1140
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,179
amazing it's just amazing how they

1141
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,599
adapted to that

1142
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:46,919
oh it helped them hunt and made their

1143
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,300
life easier

1144
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:54,960
yeah I I they call them dog soldiers too

1145
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:57,300
um the people that rode the early horses

1146
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,220
they were they they were comparing

1147
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,079
courses to large what does it feel like

1148
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:03,779
to be around these petroglyphs did you

1149
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,940
get any like I know it's it's kind of

1150
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,300
hard to quantify spiritual spirituality

1151
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:11,579
and feelings and stuff but did you ever

1152
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,920
get any kind of

1153
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:15,780
spark of energy or any kind it kind of

1154
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,159
sounds so weird saying that but did you

1155
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,380
ever feel anything around these

1156
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:20,399
petroglyphs of note

1157
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,940
um

1158
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,480
yes but it's hard to quantify like you

1159
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,760
said Sending next to a fire

1160
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,559
we we made underground fire pits so that

1161
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,720
the Flames wouldn't be visible sixteen

1162
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,420
hundred of feet above us was a small

1163
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:39,299
Pueblo the Bruins of just two foot walls

1164
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:43,139
but the outlines created made about 20

1165
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:45,599
rooms and wow and down below the

1166
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:48,539
boulders that next near the creek that

1167
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,720
had the some of these petroglys had

1168
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:55,199
outline of that structure you know 16

1169
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:57,959
rooms little squares so they they had

1170
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,939
some very interesting communication and

1171
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,000
to feel first that next near the creek

1172
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:06,420
that had the some of these petroglets

1173
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,199
had outline of that structure you know

1174
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:13,019
16 rooms little squares so they they had

1175
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:14,759
some very interesting communication and

1176
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:17,699
to feel

1177
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,140
well to be growing weed in the middle of

1178
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:22,019
all that was very

1179
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:25,019
um very powerful If We Had a Farm where

1180
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:27,300
and just had 10 acres it'd be cool

1181
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:30,719
but being surrounded by this and at

1182
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:33,000
night hearing a creek flowing by and

1183
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:36,719
Bears smashing through the bushes and

1184
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,818
stuff it's like the only thing that

1185
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:42,480
divides you from the people who wrote

1186
00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:44,699
those messages is time and like what a

1187
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,838
small barrier in some ways an

1188
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:48,299
understanding

1189
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,358
and understanding yeah so I'd like to

1190
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:53,880
talk to you about one thing and this is

1191
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:56,460
um something that I feel like it like I

1192
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,640
talk about it a lot but I'm younger so

1193
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:03,119
even in my generation it was almost a

1194
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:05,818
loss or unless you were into uh maybe

1195
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,800
tattooing or even Plumbing or part of a

1196
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:11,759
union job or something like that which

1197
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,500
is apprenticeship learning a craft under

1198
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,599
someone

1199
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,420
um learning

1200
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:22,680
learning the The Apprentice men

1201
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:24,599
Apprentice Mentor role where you snap to

1202
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,399
it do what you say you know because

1203
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:28,500
you're learning

1204
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,318
um and and how that applies in modern

1205
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,039
days and and how much of that is missing

1206
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:34,259
now

1207
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,000
in your time when you wanted to learn to

1208
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,800
grow were there guys that you could

1209
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,679
Apprentice under how would you have

1210
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:44,280
found an apprentice in the 70s

1211
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:47,699
let's say or 60s uh to learn to grow in

1212
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,400
76 when my dealer friend from Tempe said

1213
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:52,199
let's grow our own and I went sure

1214
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,539
um I already had a green thumb as far as

1215
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,939
I worked on five acres of garlic with

1216
00:48:54,539 --> 00:49:00,480
some other hippies and Cottonwood

1217
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:03,179
Arizona and I love taking care of plants

1218
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,699
in my yard Vines anything that could

1219
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:08,699
make it pretty and beautiful

1220
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:09,719
I planted a few trees already so I kind

1221
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:12,539
of knew

1222
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:15,959
soil culture a bit comfortable to step

1223
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:17,759
in then yeah and yeah what I didn't know

1224
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,519
is anything about

1225
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,400
the needs of cannabis as it grew and

1226
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:26,460
especially when to harvest it and how to

1227
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,858
Manicure it how to dry it manicure so

1228
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,380
that was self-taught with my friend he

1229
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:33,960
had never grown either and luckily we

1230
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,680
had the Growers guides and later

1231
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:41,460
marijuana botany and all these fantastic

1232
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:43,379
so I frequently say the word

1233
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,980
the written word has always been my

1234
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,599
guide and my mentor I I would buy books

1235
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:52,318
and books and books on everything and

1236
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:53,838
just read and get ideas and ways to do

1237
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:57,059
it

1238
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:59,578
I didn't Apprentice it as a carpenter or

1239
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:01,318
plumber or anything like that today

1240
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,420
you know with the Advent of more

1241
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:04,318
artificial intelligence doing other

1242
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,838
things

1243
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:10,619
really if you can fix air conditioners

1244
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:11,639
or heaters or Plumbing or electricity or

1245
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:13,260
build things

1246
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,960
you're not going to have to worry until

1247
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,579
it's like George Jetson time and your

1248
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,720
robots that can walk around and do

1249
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,099
everything

1250
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,259
um I don't know that that day is going

1251
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:24,660
to come but

1252
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:27,420
probably will I don't yeah

1253
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:28,858
maybe 50 years from now or 30 years I

1254
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,900
don't know they're they're creating

1255
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:33,299
robots to fight other humans which is

1256
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:36,960
stupid or other robots but

1257
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:40,260
yeah uh part of it you know being an

1258
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,119
apprentice to a great mentor would be

1259
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:46,020
fabulous

1260
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:48,539
um I know people who have gone to work

1261
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:50,280
in Colorado at Big rows and learn the

1262
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:54,179
basics and after a couple years they

1263
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,280
come home and they they've learn what

1264
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:58,199
they needed to know to feel confident to

1265
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,000
do it themselves

1266
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:02,699
but so wait

1267
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,920
but jumping out yeah like you mentioned

1268
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:07,139
if you're not invested in it and you

1269
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,659
haven't put 10 or 20 years in

1270
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:13,019
you you can always just quit like you

1271
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:15,179
mentioned and walk away whereas someone

1272
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:17,639
who spent a whole lot of years learning

1273
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:21,179
how to refinish furniture or build

1274
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:23,519
furniture or anything uh

1275
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:25,618
I have a nephew who's learning about

1276
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,019
furniture right now and he's refinishing

1277
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:32,400
it and starting from scratch but I don't

1278
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:34,259
think he has a teacher other than

1279
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,780
Maybe YouTube

1280
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,000
you know and that's that's a legitimate

1281
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,040
method of learning now that wasn't there

1282
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,739
when we were you know doing stuff oh

1283
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,779
yeah oh yeah I was gonna change out my

1284
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:47,459
headlights and my Tacoma because they're

1285
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,400
10 years old and they're they're fading

1286
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:52,679
and I've bought 3M cleaners to put on

1287
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,160
you know and wipe the glass it's not

1288
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,598
even glass it's polycarbonate and it

1289
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:02,879
works for a while and then it goes back

1290
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:05,519
to being bad yeah so I looked online at

1291
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,800
a guy who shows how to replace them and

1292
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,780
there's like 10 different electrical

1293
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,059
connections and if you could take a

1294
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,440
photo every time you got to a certain

1295
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,720
spot you're going to pull this one off

1296
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,300
and this take a photo and then when you

1297
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:20,519
pull it out take a photo yeah

1298
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,140
I get to a dealer and paid them to do it

1299
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:24,179
took them an hour and a half to put two

1300
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,078
new ones in it would have taken me two

1301
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,818
days

1302
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,619
um

1303
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:30,900
man I might have made a mistake and then

1304
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:32,940
have to troubleshoot which wire did I

1305
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,440
leave off or put on the wrong one yeah

1306
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,260
no

1307
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,240
um it wasn't so it cost 150 a light to

1308
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:42,420
have them do it and it was worth every

1309
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:44,338
penny so I bet those guys who did that

1310
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,818
in an hour and a half they apprenticed

1311
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:50,400
for many years yeah mechanics who could

1312
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:54,659
do stuff like that I'm in awe of I never

1313
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,519
really next to that level no

1314
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:59,159
of course I ever did was change the

1315
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:01,318
starter in my Volkswagen van I did that

1316
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:05,639
myself I felt very proud

1317
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:07,318
I bet I used to have a 66 bug and um the

1318
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:09,239
idle pin would always mess up so I

1319
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:11,519
learned that if I got duct tape and a

1320
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:13,139
pencil eraser and put it on that idle

1321
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,519
pin that it would fix it every time

1322
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:19,558
that's about the most auto mechanics

1323
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:19,559
I've ever done is the old eraser yeah

1324
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:26,159
you uh turn it on its head and found a

1325
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:28,519
workaround which I did which I've seen

1326
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,618
some great mechanics back in the days

1327
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,900
that could do the same thing and duct

1328
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:36,119
tape man

1329
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:38,220
and bailing wire Gotta Have balance so

1330
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:39,838
when you think you're off road and you

1331
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:42,439
hit that muffler and it's hanging you

1332
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:45,900
can strap it back

1333
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,300
so there's also

1334
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,619
the idea and this this kind of goes

1335
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:53,099
along with the idea of mentorship

1336
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:56,640
apprenticeship and it's becoming a part

1337
00:53:53,099 --> 00:54:00,059
of a group

1338
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,199
um for example when you become a part of

1339
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:04,200
a forum

1340
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:06,598
when the Forum days were around and big

1341
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,759
you know ever I I remember my first time

1342
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,400
coming on the forums and

1343
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,980
trying to figure out how first what am I

1344
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,440
what do I say without looking stupid

1345
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:19,440
right how do I integrate into this group

1346
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:21,000
that I don't quite understand some of

1347
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,460
these subcultures like I was a punk rock

1348
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,219
kid in my area growing up I don't really

1349
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,559
relate to the deadhead Community very

1350
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:30,598
much but that's a lot of this community

1351
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,359
is the hippie community so I've got to

1352
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:35,519
learn to integrate and communicate with

1353
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,380
people I've never really integrated with

1354
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,619
or communicated with or understand their

1355
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:42,358
cultural subcultural level and

1356
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:44,039
um we don't really seem to have that

1357
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:46,679
anymore what we have are social media

1358
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:48,779
where you just blast out whatever you

1359
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:52,078
know but back then you had to integrate

1360
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,780
yourself into a group to gain access not

1361
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,599
even to gain access but to to learn from

1362
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,460
each other and at that point you know to

1363
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,500
share then Cuts were shared between the

1364
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,659
group because you trusted each other you

1365
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,460
knew each other you know and it was over

1366
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:07,259
a period of several years where a lot of

1367
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,019
these groups and friendships were formed

1368
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,599
and bound and I I talked to the guys

1369
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:14,880
today like in my in our patreon Discord

1370
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:17,039
group and I see how some guys try to

1371
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,900
assimilate you know and some don't it's

1372
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,940
just it's very different than the Forum

1373
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,740
error where you where you watch these

1374
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,960
personalities kind of try to assimilate

1375
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:27,118
whereas now it's just like

1376
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,800
lots of clashing personalities all

1377
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,539
falling on top of each other and nobody

1378
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,480
really understanding assimilation into

1379
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:36,119
groups it's very fascinating you mean

1380
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,099
like I see maggots yeah yeah exactly

1381
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,599
it's it's a bunch of personalities all

1382
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:42,660
screaming at each other as opposed to

1383
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,420
like a group working together I see Mac

1384
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:47,219
had the great you know um SD's finest

1385
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:50,338
group that did pretty cool the San

1386
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:53,159
Diego's finest cuts on I see map those

1387
00:55:50,338 --> 00:55:54,900
guys did really good for a long time

1388
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:56,219
um but they're so far and few between I

1389
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,720
mean you have the land race groups on

1390
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:00,239
icy mag that all kind of pulled together

1391
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:03,480
you know over time and they have some

1392
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:06,598
good groups and uh yeah they all had a

1393
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:09,300
huge following Tom Hill eventually got

1394
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:12,059
so fed up with all these um people

1395
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,240
hounding him and he

1396
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:18,000
he would just blast people

1397
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:20,098
was one of my early Heroes of the floor

1398
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,599
just because he didn't like it's not

1399
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:23,280
that he would just go off on people that

1400
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,440
wasn't it was that he would do it and he

1401
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,119
was right and he was correct when he was

1402
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,940
saying it you know and he was a

1403
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,640
geneticist he could quit the top of him

1404
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:35,700
if he and Rob Clark were sitting down or

1405
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:37,739
someone who really knew genetics well he

1406
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:40,439
he would have no difficulty you know

1407
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:41,838
talking about back Crossing and uh just

1408
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,818
all the different

1409
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:46,259
mathematical formulas involved so you

1410
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,239
knew what how many would be this how

1411
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,760
many would be that way what Gene

1412
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:53,219
Expressions would you expect yeah I love

1413
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:56,280
that it's beyond me

1414
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:58,919
um I can kind of grab the concept

1415
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,800
if I'm growing a hybrid

1416
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,599
and I have 10 of those come up and I

1417
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,059
look at them I'll see differences in

1418
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,099
them I'm not sure I could scientifically

1419
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:12,140
say well one quarter we're going to be

1420
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:15,260
this cross you know and or Express these

1421
00:57:12,139 --> 00:57:18,000
recessive genes and you know whoa yeah

1422
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:20,160
it's something else yeah yeah trying to

1423
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,300
have conversations with him is is very

1424
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,719
humbling

1425
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:27,539
on a burrito level you can go going back

1426
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,159
to the uh apprenticeship imagine being

1427
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:32,039
an apprentice

1428
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:34,440
Petroglyph artist in the Native American

1429
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:37,259
days or someone who made projectile

1430
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,539
points whether they were spear points

1431
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:42,900
for the Paleo Indians ten thousand years

1432
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:45,358
ago to run up and kill Buffalo or the

1433
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,639
Archaic Period that came next and they

1434
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:50,098
were adult points that were looked like

1435
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:53,639
large arrowheads and they would boost a

1436
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:55,079
spear thrower spear and then finally the

1437
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:57,838
bow and arrow showed up in the southwest

1438
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:01,079
and little tiny points

1439
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:03,358
which are sometimes called bird points

1440
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:04,740
they had to be very tiny and sharp and

1441
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,139
lightweight because they're going to be

1442
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:10,159
shooting through the air on a stick and

1443
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:12,900
if you put a big point on there

1444
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:14,358
the that Arrow would just go

1445
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,559
40 feet

1446
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:18,900
yeah yeah so

1447
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,119
those to find

1448
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,460
to find their ancient work on the ground

1449
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,039
when you're hiking is mind-boggling too

1450
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:28,679
to know how long it would take to be an

1451
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:29,818
apprentice and get skilled at making

1452
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:32,460
those

1453
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:35,219
when they had such a tough life to live

1454
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,019
every day that they couldn't just take a

1455
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:39,419
whole day to make points unless they

1456
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:40,380
were special and they were so good or

1457
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,960
maybe

1458
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,338
women they they

1459
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,798
believed that there was great women

1460
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:49,380
Point makers too because they didn't go

1461
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:52,019
hunting as much yeah and they were

1462
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,298
taking care of the home front and

1463
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:56,639
they would have possible time at least

1464
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:59,519
before the Advent of

1465
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,019
people growing crops and corn yeah where

1466
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:02,639
you had to be out you know taking care

1467
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:05,759
of the plants and

1468
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:08,098
stopping animals from eating them wow

1469
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,420
we've covered a lot of territory today I

1470
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:13,539
love Petroglyph stuff dude like

1471
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,539
[Music]

1472
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,260
[Music]

1473
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,280
um it was like it was like I was

1474
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:24,540
connected with everything around me

1475
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,940
all of a sudden I just started

1476
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:29,179
questioning everything I'd ever been

1477
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,179
told

1478
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:37,039
you know by the time by the time I got

1479
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,039
high that very first time

breeders Syndicate update not only is

1487
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:08,399
our merch store up at syndicategear.com

1488
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:11,519
but all episodes will remain free but

1489
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,780
what we need from you is interaction if

1490
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,719
you're watching the show for your first

1491
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,940
time kick back and enjoy it if you like

1492
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:20,399
the show feel free to like it but if

1493
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,900
it's your second viewing we ask a gentle

1494
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,059
person's agreement that you click the

1495
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,338
Subscribe button it costs you nothing

1496
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:28,200
but it helps us tremendously with the

1497
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:30,420
sneaky YouTube algorithm

1498
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:32,578
leaving comments telling not to his

1502
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:40,318
