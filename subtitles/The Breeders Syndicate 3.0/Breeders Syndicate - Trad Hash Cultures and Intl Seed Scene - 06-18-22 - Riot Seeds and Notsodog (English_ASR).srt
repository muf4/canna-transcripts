1
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
all right

2
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
take you in a bit

3
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,759
what's up everyone

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,320
slowly

5
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,320
waking up

6
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,600
okay i guess we wait for natso

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
we have um

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
some kind of stuff planned a little

9
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
planned as much as we

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,960
plan

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,878
i don't plan too well so my apologies in

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,600
advance

13
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,599
how's everyone doing

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,599
slowly waiting for people to show up get

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
it started so i was thinking of doing a

16
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,839
giveaway today you know at some point of

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,439
this [ __ ] so

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,200
we'll probably do that

19
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,000
i got a better idea so naza didn't have

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
to come up with it

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,359
yo yo yo

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
what's the habs jack adjusting the

23
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:30,239
height of my little thing here

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,239
yeah that's what she said oh man

25
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,200
all right you're good

26
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,239
i am good you're good haircut

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,560
seems good you get a haircut i do

28
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,000
yeah no not really no i got a haircut

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,000
last week i think

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,239
it looks good until it mushrooms out it

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,239
doesn't really go long it goes wide and

32
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,399
then it gives you a [ __ ] so just

33
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,399
like it just expands outward and you can

34
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
wait for it to fall but

35
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
i don't have enough hair left to really

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
make that work whenever my hair grows

37
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,758
out like it starts doing this thing

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,920
where it flips and curls right here on

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,159
the sideburn area

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
really really awesome looks cool peter

41
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,320
pan

42
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,840
all right so what do we want to start

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,959
off with um what did you want to kick it

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
off with

45
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,680
well uh we've been doing uh so

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
again what we're gonna do is we've done

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,439
a bunch of shows that are that are like

48
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,559
somewhat like uh

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,759
themed you know um and then the last few

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,598
that we've been doing have kind of been

51
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,199
more a bit more like uh

52
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,959
some loose subject matter that we

53
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,439
discussed and then we riff off and then

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,120
we answer some questions and such and it

55
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,000
seems like people uh

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,000
people are into that as well so uh we're

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
gonna do one of those where

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,439
um we're gonna touch on some different

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,560
stuff that people asked about during the

60
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,239
week on our discord and then uh we'll

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,959
riff off that a bit and people can

62
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,959
answer questions or ask questions

63
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,840
um matt's a little bit better at reading

64
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,319
the screen than i am but i'll try i can

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,479
feel some for you you can field some if

66
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,119
you see anything that pops up that looks

67
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,439
normal yeah so

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,519
i don't know normally we wait until

69
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,199
it's 150ish people or something like

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,120
that but we'll yeah we could start we

71
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,839
could start in a second so

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,400
um a couple of things that that people

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,560
wanted to chat about a little bit was uh

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,120
um some stuff that i'll mostly talk

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,840
about which is sort of like the some

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,039
traditional hash aspects right

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,719
and then there's some stuff that's a

78
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,239
little bit more matte where people were

79
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,919
asking about like

80
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,439
you know what's like the international

81
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,878
seed scene like

82
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,878
uh today how does that all work uh what

83
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,959
is you know what is what's changing in

84
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,919
the in the in this in the seed world or

85
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,959
whatever

86
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,798
um and matt's a lot more uh uh can speak

87
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,560
a lot more eloquently on that than i can

88
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,719
really um

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
but you can speak on the hash because i

90
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,878
i i

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,519
have never smoked like afghan lebanese

92
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,679
blonde i mean i had a chunk of

93
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
silk road hash that was like

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,599
i was i didn't smoke it was too scary to

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,920
smoke so i just didn't

96
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,759
so it's it's interesting and like the

97
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,079
hash thing um

98
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:09,120
you know the hash thing is is kind of

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,159
cool because you can we can widen it out

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
a little bit

101
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,560
in the sense of um you know and talk

102
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
about like some traditional weed

103
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,000
cultures yeah because there is a real

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,120
divide in weed cultures between cultures

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,839
that grew weed primarily to make hashish

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,720
sure uh and cultures that grew weed

107
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,839
primarily to smoke weed

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,479
you know yeah um and you know that that

109
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,399
aspect and those choices made

110
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,319
um made a lot of differences for people

111
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,758
and now for a long time

112
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,599
america

113
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,199
one of the benefits of america is that

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,639
we're isolated from everywhere we have

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,879
like big oceans

116
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,280
yeah on either side and all that but

117
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,240
we're very far away from the hash

118
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,119
culture

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,079
yeah right so traditionally

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
uh all the best hash sort of stays local

121
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,038
uh and then some small amount of it

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,199
would go to europe right yeah uh and

123
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,639
what america typically got

124
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,759
was uh the b and c grade yeah you know

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,280
so a lot of times americans especially

126
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,360
canadians are a little different

127
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,038
canadians had some better connections

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,038
and some better smuggling that happened

129
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,319
up there yeah so they sometimes saw a

130
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,000
little bit better of a grade but

131
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,879
americans especially

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,199
um

133
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,478
you know they uh we got the shaft as far

134
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,879
as high grade

135
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:30,478
so a lot of people think of

136
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,399
um imagine if your view of kind bud was

137
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,159
like beasters

138
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,279
yeah and that's what you thought it was

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
because that's the only thing you've

140
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,959
experienced a lot of people if you

141
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,478
haven't been to europe and you haven't

142
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,799
and you haven't and you haven't been

143
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,560
tied into those communities right yeah

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
you probably haven't smoked the best of

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,839
the best

146
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
and so there's a lot of hash people in

147
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,918
america that think like the last 10 or

148
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,159
14 years of sort of like the hash

149
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,719
revolution that's happened over here

150
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,319
that they have the best hash by far that

151
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
they blow away all the traditional

152
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,560
cultures by far and that they're kind of

153
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,599
on the cutting edge and they've changed

154
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,839
the game

155
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,879
and they figured it out nobody else did

156
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,279
yeah

157
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,199
right which is pretty far from the case

158
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,559
yeah you know so it's like a lot of

159
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,600
those things where

160
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,680
um

161
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,240
you know we can we can kind of riff on

162
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,240
that for a little bit um so maybe you

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
can kind of talk we can we can start

164
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
like maybe we'll we'll we'll start from

165
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,038
the beginning where it's like

166
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,918
the hash culture sort of comes from

167
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,000
the

168
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,639
i would say the the near east and the

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
middle east yeah i would say indian

170
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,560
indian culture india

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,560
chinese maybe yeah i mean and and

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
probably the old probably the oldest way

173
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
to smoke cannabis

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
uh before they even figured out how to

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,759
smoke flour besides like burning flowers

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,400
on braziers or something is the hand rub

177
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,639
yeah you know um

178
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,560
and that india pakistan afghanistan iran

179
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,879
the middle east you can go into like

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
lebanon and israel in those areas and

181
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,918
you can go through north africa all the

182
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,759
way to morocco and that's sort of hash

183
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,719
culture yeah

184
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,439
right um in in terms of like people grew

185
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,240
weed just make to turn weed into hash

186
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,038
yeah

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,800
where

188
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,879
you start getting into like

189
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,280
um southeast asia

190
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,199
uh and you know and especially the new

191
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,119
world like mexico and colombia and

192
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,319
panama and these type of places in

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
africa

194
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,800
they mostly smoke wheat

195
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,879
yeah and you know um one that that

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,720
caught me off guard was nepal

197
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,038
i always think of like nepalese temple

198
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,080
balls and that kind of hash culture but

199
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,519
if i remember correctly when i was

200
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,519
studying it most of it was a flower

201
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,959
culture it was most it was it was a

202
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,318
little bit of both yeah you know um but

203
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,399
you know and so

204
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,280
to be to perfectly honest like when i

205
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,038
started going to amsterdam um i i went

206
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,878
there in search of seats

207
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,519
yeah you know and then i started getting

208
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,800
introduced to hash and uh you know i

209
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,000
smoked a bunch of stuff but in the

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,680
coffee shops uh it's a lot like you know

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,439
it's a lot like dispensaries or whatever

212
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,759
there's a wide variety yeah of mids and

213
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,279
junk and really good and pretty decent

214
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,560
and stuff and it wasn't until i met

215
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,799
collectors

216
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,759
yeah um that started explaining to me

217
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,160
like how it all worked yeah right

218
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,919
um and so

219
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
there's an aspect maybe we maybe i could

220
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,519
talk for a minute about before we talk

221
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,439
about the regional differences for a

222
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,240
second yeah maybe i could talk about

223
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,160
like

224
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
uh something that we chat about often

225
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,399
which is the vast difference between how

226
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,320
traditional hash is made

227
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,000
um and how

228
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,519
american hash is made yeah right so the

229
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,519
american hash

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,000
uh the way it's made um in most cases

231
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,159
is you it's it's you know a lot of times

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,559
it's called single source right

233
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,278
it's a single clone

234
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,518
right um grown in either depths or

235
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,080
outdoor or indoor or whatever and that

236
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,480
single clone is usually you know dried

237
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,440
or fresh frozen and then it's you know

238
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,440
it's processed um and then it's usually

239
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,360
refrigerated or frozen right away or

240
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,680
stored well until use and it's used

241
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,800
pretty quickly yeah right

242
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,519
where in traditional hash culture

243
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,319
you're harvesting a field of seeds

244
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,959
yeah

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,560
right so you know in america it's like

246
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,559
oh i'm gonna pull down this greenhouse

247
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,759
and it's all for lack of a better it's

248
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:31,119
all gmo yeah it's all the same cut you

249
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,919
know same terpene profile same cbd cbn

250
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,080
thc all that it's the same thing

251
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,000
yeah but if you're if you're harvesting

252
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,278
it from any other region you're going to

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,159
get the full range of expression of that

254
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,838
wine

255
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,240
yeah because they're harvesting

256
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,680
thousands of sisters yeah

257
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,360
and then they're processing those

258
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,039
sisters and unlike

259
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,278
unlike mo if you're if you're talking

260
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,759
about like dry sift and stuff like that

261
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,639
they tend to let that hash age

262
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,600
yeah

263
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,759
on the plant for a number of months

264
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,720
and then when it's cold and bone dry

265
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,679
they start a sifting process yeah

266
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,440
right and then from that sifting process

267
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,519
um you know then they make it into

268
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,640
various grades

269
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,959
and then they press it right so that's

270
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,439
not done in america at all

271
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,479
all of your all of your terp [ __ ] all of

272
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,360
your whether it's fresh frozen or it's

273
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,519
you know bho or it's it's uh

274
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,720
you know uh whatever extraction you're

275
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,560
doing it's usually single source yeah

276
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,240
and it's not aged usually the plan is

277
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,679
taken down fresh

278
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,959
and as soon as they can make the hash

279
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,799
they make the hash yeah right and so you

280
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,719
know i'm not exactly the expert on the

281
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,679
science or whatever but definitely aging

282
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,639
it creates you know it it transfers

283
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,879
things

284
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,360
from one to the other right certain

285
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,360
amounts of cbn or cbd or this or that or

286
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,000
whatever is converted into other

287
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,278
bioactives what not and then on top of

288
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,360
that when

289
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,200
uh we've wanted to get uh

290
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,360
our buddy bodie on here for a long time

291
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,759
to do like a hippie hashish trail kind

292
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
of episode yeah and so we might get more

293
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,240
in depth with that but

294
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,919
when

295
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,519
essentially when europeans and white

296
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,719
people first started going to the hash

297
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,560
regions and looking for export

298
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,600
most hash there was a lot of hash that

299
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,078
was one two three years old

300
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,560
yeah you know a lot of the best hashish

301
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,838
uh wasn't smoked until it was over a

302
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,879
year or two years old

303
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,240
yikes right i guess it's just different

304
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,559
climate though you know so it was

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,039
different climate it was stored it was

306
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,278
stored very differently you know and

307
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,039
they just thought that it was it was not

308
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,919
like it wasn't ready yet

309
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,719
yeah

310
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:45,360
you know and so um and what's

311
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,120
interesting about this is that if you go

312
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,200
to amsterdam

313
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,519
and you have all these people that have

314
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,680
all the same access to all the same tech

315
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,039
that we do here yeah as far as

316
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,278
extracting modern cultivars for hashish

317
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,919
and all the hash heads over there

318
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:05,600
will tell you that the best hash that

319
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,439
they smoke is the top import

320
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,519
they can use pollinators they can use

321
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,720
tumblers they can fresh froze and freeze

322
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,759
dry and microplane and do all the tricks

323
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,360
that people win awards with over here

324
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,480
and they still think that hash is

325
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,759
inferior in quality and effect

326
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,120
to the best of the best import

327
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,919
right

328
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,078
and

329
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,240
you know but in america we all think

330
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,679
that our [ __ ] is the best [ __ ] ever

331
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,200
of course

332
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,759
basically as soon as we invented the

333
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,399
nail and we invented some modern ways of

334
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:42,480
hash smoking and 09 you know 2010 2011

335
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,120
yeah that that was the revolution

336
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,839
and hash went from shitty to amazing

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,240
yeah right now it's true that most

338
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,720
americans got shitty hash and it's also

339
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,320
true that when all these white people

340
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,399
and all these europeans and all these

341
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,839
americans and and brotherhood of eternal

342
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,480
love and all these [ __ ] started

343
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,320
coming to these regions to look for hash

344
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,278
and started offering crazy amounts of

345
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,079
money

346
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,000
yeah the quality went way down yeah

347
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,159
people started adulterating it people

348
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,720
started middlemen started making it

349
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,399
worse people wanted volume because there

350
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,000
was so much demand

351
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,440
right so a lot of times the best stuff

352
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
never leaves

353
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,120
yeah even like even my friends in

354
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,040
amsterdam who are very tied in

355
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,399
them getting the best of the best is

356
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,240
really hard

357
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,679
i would imagine so and they and they

358
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,159
savor it

359
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,399
right they absolutely savor it and they

360
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,000
hold on to it and it never makes the you

361
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,480
know i almost said clubs it never it

362
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,720
almost never makes the the coffee shops

363
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
yeah because it's all traded amongst

364
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,320
each other

365
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,799
yeah right it's all bought and sold that

366
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,440
kind of grade you kind of have to know

367
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,679
someone yeah it's no different than like

368
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,839
if you if for to mention him again if

369
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,759
bodhi gave out some like 14 week amazing

370
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,440
sativa you probably wouldn't be able to

371
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,600
buy it from the cookie store

372
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,560
yeah well you'd have to have a you'd

373
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,480
have to have a homie well well maybe now

374
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,559
maybe but but even someone even

375
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,720
something that takes that long yeah yeah

376
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,559
for sure you know what i mean like in

377
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,000
europe you know there's there's still

378
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,319
like i have a buddy over there right now

379
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,519
that was texting me on what to get matt

380
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
i didn't tell you this but he just

381
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,039
bought some cg13

382
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,799
and some c5 and some and some a5 from

383
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,120
over there you know

384
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,559
um and those you know those are 15 16

385
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,799
weak strings

386
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,679
yeah that's you that's unheard of to get

387
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,838
yeah

388
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,719
in a dispensary over here yeah that's

389
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,160
wild

390
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
but over there it's their bread and

391
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,039
butter

392
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,198
yeah you know so you can find that stuff

393
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,719
so the biggest just to reiterate before

394
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,599
we get too off track

395
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,680
um

396
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,519
the biggest differences between

397
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,719
american hash and like the best

398
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,679
traditional

399
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
is

400
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,039
uh

401
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,000
you know the what i was told by the the

402
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,480
amsterdam cruise is like the best stuff

403
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,879
is made in traditional regions but

404
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,879
westerners help them

405
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,198
to make sure that the purity and the

406
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,838
process is amazing

407
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,479
okay does that make sense so making

408
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,720
their technique more purifying making

409
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,959
making sure that the cl the cleanliness

410
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,440
you know and the technique and all that

411
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,119
is good screens and everything like that

412
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,519
and you know people one of the reasons

413
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,000
why people ask this is people asked

414
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,440
about temple balls right these nepalese

415
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,958
temple balls

416
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,120
and i will say that these nepalese

417
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,638
temple balls that i smoked from my buddy

418
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,000
was some of the best hash i've ever

419
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,360
smoked in my life

420
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,759
okay and it's interesting because a lot

421
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,480
of people over there feel that way yeah

422
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,560
right

423
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,879
and they feel that like there's

424
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,799
something to the fact that like a lot of

425
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,120
this stuff is being grown at six or

426
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,000
seven or eight thousand feet

427
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,159
yeah

428
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,480
right where the air is thinner

429
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,240
and there's more uv

430
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,159
and maybe that leads to a different type

431
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,639
of psychoactive or a different type of

432
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,039
thc production i'm sure

433
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,919
you know and so they would say that like

434
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,439
you know uh our buddy yo sammy

435
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,198
you know would say i don't care what

436
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,880
modern cultivar you have i don't care

437
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,719
what amazing cut you think you have or

438
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,399
how pure you make it

439
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,759
you know it shits the bed next to the

440
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,679
best typical

441
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,480
yeah like if you can get the best of the

442
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,159
best he's like just in flavor and effect

443
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,440
yeah right an effect is hard to say

444
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,360
because it's invisible right yeah so

445
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,600
we got used to making all these modern

446
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,480
cultivars and thinking that like

447
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,240
thousands of years of hash culture

448
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,639
we just beat

449
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,159
yeah because we're a little cleaner

450
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,519
yeah because we gotta have a little bit

451
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,879
better and we have a little bit we have

452
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,039
some machinery and we're a little bit

453
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,480
better processed but like old timers

454
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,000
will tell you that like they think that

455
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,440
putting your hash in the in the in the

456
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,399
fridge ruins it

457
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,240
yeah

458
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,039
and you know what what what's weird

459
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,879
about the nepalese stuff is i will say

460
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,198
that

461
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,278
this isn't a plug on it or whatever but

462
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,599
anything i've ever smelled

463
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,559
that smelled like the mendo perps that i

464
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,120
cracked

465
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,359
yeah had the mendo perps in it

466
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,599
yeah in the sense that like i've never

467
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,078
smelled that terpene profile

468
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,678
from any other plant that wasn't it

469
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,759
yeah

470
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,519
unless it was related to it in the sense

471
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,000
that like someone bred with it or it was

472
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:22,000
it was an ancestor of that right yeah

473
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,679
except these temple balls that i smoked

474
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,119
and they smelled when you were burning

475
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,480
them they smelled like you were burning

476
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,239
mendo perps

477
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,839
that's interesting now you know does

478
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,160
that mean that like the mendo p is

479
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,159
nepalese i don't know you know but or

480
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,519
does it mean that it just evoked that

481
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,038
terpene profile yeah you know

482
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:43,759
i i can't say um but all those guys over

483
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,919
there what's crazy is that um

484
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,879
all those hash heads over there they

485
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,440
grow all kinds of phenomenal weed

486
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,520
and they sell all that weed to buy the

487
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
best hash they can get

488
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,000
yeah

489
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,599
you know like somebody like somebody

490
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,279
like you know uh when you were

491
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,639
interviewing uh

492
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,558
uh camara and and red you know yeah

493
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,559
i mean he was saying that like you know

494
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,960
he's never even seen sam skunk man smoke

495
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,960
weed yeah

496
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,558
that you know the the top people over

497
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,038
there are hershey's

498
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,599
yeah you know they smoke hatch

499
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,798
they're resin farmers makes sense you

500
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,798
know that's what they're after they're

501
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,960
after a resin yeah

502
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,079
and so you know we could widen that out

503
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
for a little bit

504
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,119
and talk about how

505
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,279
um

506
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,439
you know this is like a totally

507
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,480
different tangent or whatever but

508
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,759
um

509
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,240
when

510
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,519
americans started smoking weed

511
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,279
we were a flower culture

512
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,679
we were getting weed from mexico and

513
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,759
panama and jamaica and colombia and all

514
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,440
these things and we were getting bricked

515
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,440
um and we were getting you know we were

516
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,440
getting bricked of this stuff

517
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
and we started blending them with

518
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,160
afghans because of prohibition right

519
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,319
and it's super common and matt can speak

520
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,120
on this too but um

521
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:03,519
most of the weed smokers back then

522
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,119
were very disappointed in the smoke of

523
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,918
the afghans

524
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,439
yeah

525
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,640
they didn't really like the high and

526
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
they didn't really like the way it

527
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,240
burned

528
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,240
yeah i mean it was so vastly different

529
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,400
than what they were used to

530
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,759
compared to compared to sativas because

531
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,120
those sativas

532
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:23,839
have been have been bred for smoking

533
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,479
yeah they were bred for they were bred

534
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,399
to be burned as flower yeah you know

535
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
where i mean i i told this before but

536
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,440
there's this funny story of when sam

537
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,359
skunk man was in

538
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,120
um was in afghanistan and he was

539
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,839
searching for seeds

540
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,159
right

541
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,119
and so he was asking these warlords for

542
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,400
seeds

543
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,359
for flower

544
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
you know

545
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,279
and they looked at him

546
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,080
and they said you know smoking flowers

547
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,720
for women and slaves

548
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,558
right are you a woman or a slave yeah

549
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,798
and he had to convince them

550
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,558
that he was a man and he just wanted

551
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,038
them so he could grow his own

552
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,918
flower at home and make resin

553
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,879
i wonder if he pulled out his wiener

554
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,759
you know

555
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,760
uh and let me prove it you know but to

556
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,558
them it was like that that was that was

557
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,519
the thing the flower was a waste product

558
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,599
yeah

559
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,639
you know peasants and women slaves and

560
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,158
women's smoked smoked flour real men

561
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,720
smoked hash

562
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,720
that was their culture so obviously you

563
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,759
don't care how flower burns and you

564
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,200
don't care how the flower affects you

565
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,480
because you never smoke it in that

566
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,360
culture yeah so americans were the first

567
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,880
people taking all these hash plants and

568
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,000
and afghans

569
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,520
and actually wanting to smoke them yeah

570
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,359
it hadn't happened before because none

571
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,599
of those people back back home where

572
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,558
they were from gave a [ __ ]

573
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,359
yes

574
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,639
and you can kind of draw a line from

575
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,359
morocco

576
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,440
on the the western part of africa all

577
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,319
throughout north africa all the way up

578
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,038
through

579
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,798
um lebanon and israel

580
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,960
all the way over iran and into

581
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,279
afghanistan and that's all hash

582
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,840
yeah right

583
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,599
but then once you get to like cambodia

584
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,519
thailand

585
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,719
that all kind of got lost

586
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,519
yeah and it flipped into weed smoking

587
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,038
and exporting actual wheat

588
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,279
you know

589
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,558
huh i wonder why

590
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,839
i don't know why that one became so

591
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,960
separate

592
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,240
you know i don't know

593
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,880
you know

594
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,640
um you know and you know it's like i i

595
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,960
prefer flour too to be honest and i

596
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,799
don't think that we need to like base

597
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,038
what what what we think of on what

598
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,079
afghans think um

599
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:36,879
but uh

600
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,199
you know

601
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,320
definitely they um you know they just

602
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,159
thought that because that was the

603
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,200
culture that they were raised men smoke

604
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,720
ash

605
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,679
yeah you know and women smoke flour and

606
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
slaves

607
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,038
i like they weren't good they weren't

608
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,038
good enough

609
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,319
women were puffing tough on the flower

610
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,079
over there

611
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,119
and you know and so there's this thing

612
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,798
where when i first went over to

613
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,879
amsterdam i met this guy he's still over

614
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,558
there steve the nose or whatever and i

615
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,760
got introduced to some of this hashish

616
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,000
culture

617
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,000
and they would show me the best moroccan

618
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,880
the best lebanese these are amazing

619
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,839
temple balls this is from afghanistan

620
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,760
this is from the pakistani highlands

621
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,158
and you smoke all this stuff and it's

622
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,839
unbelievable yeah like he had the best

623
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,520
hash collection i've ever seen in my

624
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,119
life and these guys

625
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,879
they didn't even really smoke weed very

626
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,639
much they had it

627
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,760
you know but they mostly cared about

628
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,600
hashish

629
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,279
that's so funny you know and they

630
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,279
thought they didn't care what method you

631
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,960
used they didn't care what extraction

632
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,599
technique you had

633
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,919
uh did all all those cuts that you could

634
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:44,798
make hash off of they were inferior yeah

635
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,640
they were it was inferior hashish

636
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,918
interesting you know

637
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,000
yeah and

638
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,520
you know and so we we

639
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,038
huh

640
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,480
my mother knew you there i'm here so you

641
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,279
know they um

642
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
so

643
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,839
it's really a big it's really

644
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,360
interesting because americans like until

645
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,798
things open up

646
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,558
um i would say that 99 of americans have

647
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,879
probably never smoked

648
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,759
the top import grade of hash that you

649
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,559
can get

650
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,319
yeah

651
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,319
they just haven't seen it yeah it

652
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,158
doesn't it doesn't show up it gets it

653
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,639
barely gets to europe

654
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,799
yeah before it gets absorbed i see a lot

655
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,080
of people asking about the the opium

656
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,599
thing

657
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,960
and i can comment on that real quick

658
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,000
what they're referring to is an old

659
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,720
story

660
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,159
and it wasn't hash it wasn't a weed

661
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,159
thing it was necessarily it wasn't

662
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,840
necessary we think the story was that

663
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,320
tie sticks were dipped in something

664
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:41,119
called pasta water which was uh the

665
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,918
water used when you produce heroin so

666
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,359
when you're when you're doing the

667
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,278
conversion from opium to heroin the

668
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,278
leftover water is called passive water

669
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,960
so there was theories and or people

670
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,640
would spread stories that you know all

671
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,558
thai sticks were dipped in pasta water

672
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,480
and that's why they were so strong when

673
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,960
in reality it probably wasn't the case

674
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,480
that's not really how how the the water

675
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,798
works drying on the to weed you know

676
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,240
but it that that is stuck forever so

677
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,038
that a lot of people think that thai

678
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,519
sticks have heroin in them and that's

679
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,400
yeah that's where that came from

680
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,000
and you know they don't mostly because

681
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,600
yeah i think if it happened it would

682
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
have been very rare

683
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,599
i mean the re the reason why is because

684
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,640
cartels like that

685
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,798
um

686
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,360
they don't put more expensive drugs on

687
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,440
cheaper ones yeah never free that's not

688
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,759
how that's not how they operate you know

689
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
yeah i mean uh you know now with like

690
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,960
the whole fentanyl thing and all that

691
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
there are people are cutting all kinds

692
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
of stuff with highly dangerous

693
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,440
substances

694
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,959
yeah uh back in the day if anything got

695
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,558
cut with anything it was by something

696
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,120
cheaper and weaker

697
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,798
yeah i still am very skeptical on on

698
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,479
street fentanyl being cut into normal

699
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,079
things because it's still more expensive

700
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,839
i would imagine then

701
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,439
most of the drugs are saying that it's

702
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,798
cut with it doesn't really make sense

703
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,480
unless people are trying to buy fentanyl

704
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,558
and they're cutting it with [ __ ] but

705
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,079
cheaper i'm gonna i'm gonna reiterate it

706
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,000
one more time just because i think it's

707
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,720
really important which is that almost

708
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,919
all traditional hash regardless of grade

709
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,079
or quality

710
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,240
is made out of thousands and thousands

711
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,678
and thousands of sister plants

712
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,720
grown from seed

713
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,320
and so you get a very wide range of that

714
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,839
that strains profile thc

715
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,000
cbd cbn terpenes all that kind of stuff

716
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,959
it all gets blended together

717
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,558
right yeah and so it's

718
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,759
vastly different

719
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,079
than

720
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,879
growing a room or growing a greenhouse

721
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,038
of gmo or skittles yeah or something

722
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,159
along those lines and taking the exact

723
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,158
same genetic cut

724
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,000
right yep and

725
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:47,278
that exact same genetic cut and uh

726
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and and extracting that

727
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,599
right

728
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,839
it's just very different and the way

729
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,678
they process it is different and how

730
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,678
long that it takes them before they

731
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,200
think it's cured into something that

732
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,080
they want to smoke

733
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,880
is also different so american hash

734
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,439
culture is very new

735
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,520
and it goes against the grain as far as

736
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,519
like any other kinds of

737
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,679
uh hashish culture that you would that

738
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,879
you would you would see now it is true

739
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,960
of course that with with demand

740
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,120
right they're going to mix all kind

741
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,519
brokers and and and people looking for

742
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,558
profit are going to mix all kinds of of

743
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:27,119
cut into hash yeah i'm talking about the

744
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,000
nicest stuff i'm talking about the pure

745
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,399
grade

746
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,759
right and hash in these regions was a

747
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,679
lot better

748
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,200
before all these white people showed up

749
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,038
demanding tons oh i'm sure

750
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,159
and then once all these europeans and

751
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,919
all these english and all these

752
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,640
americans started showing up on the

753
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,360
hippie hashish trail in the 70s and they

754
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,440
wanted just enormous amounts of it they

755
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,879
blew through all the best

756
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,080
and then of course just like any other

757
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,880
humans you're going to get a bunch of

758
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,599
people that are trying to meet demand

759
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,360
yeah so the quality on average is going

760
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,639
to go way down

761
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,759
and you're going to get a bunch of b and

762
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
c grade

763
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,759
and then you're going to get

764
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,918
you know and then you're going to get um

765
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,278
you know the the top end is gonna be a

766
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,240
lot more rare

767
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:11,200
yeah

768
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,679
you know

769
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,440
um and you know

770
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,240
like i said all those old-timers that

771
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,640
smokehash they all swear

772
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,839
that the best traditional hash is still

773
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,440
the best

774
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,839
yeah now whether that's because of the

775
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,080
strains they use whether that's because

776
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,119
it they dry farm it you know i mean i'm

777
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,079
sure there's a bunch of different

778
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,599
reasons

779
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,798
but the process itself is very different

780
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,038
yeah

781
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,079
and the effect is very different and

782
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,640
they

783
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,319
they all they all swear by it and that's

784
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,200
what they take the best of what they

785
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,158
grow

786
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,440
um

787
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,600
you know and that and people say that

788
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,120
too people say i see that all the time i

789
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,558
have a buddy of mine that was like oh

790
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,079
yeah yeah yeah they know what they're

791
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,678
[ __ ] talking about they [ __ ] make

792
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,278
hash with the same hat the hand they

793
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,159
[ __ ] wipe their [ __ ] on

794
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,319
yeah right and it's basically like

795
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,399
these people these humans that have

796
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,879
spent thousands of years refining their

797
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,479
hash culture don't know [ __ ]

798
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,520
yeah from what we've learned since oh

799
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,079
wait on

800
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,240
yeah right

801
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,079
right and different cultures we've gone

802
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,120
we've gone through everybody dabbed with

803
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:20,079
a [ __ ] thousand degree glowing cherry

804
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,558
red hot nail or banger yeah

805
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,319
unpurged bho

806
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,720
every two or three years we're like

807
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,558
improving our technique and you only

808
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,399
have to go back five or six or seven

809
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,759
years to techniques and [ __ ] that people

810
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,398
wouldn't do again

811
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,038
yeah it already get out of style that we

812
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,199
learned that a bunch of these terpenes

813
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,960
are like carcinogenic

814
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,880
yeah at the heat that most of these

815
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,440
people were dabbing them

816
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,360
yeah with right and then the other thing

817
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,159
too is when you watch you know you can

818
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,918
get on ig right and you can watch some

819
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,640
of these hash cultures work and how they

820
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,080
heat the hash and how they work the hash

821
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,559
you know and how they get the hash

822
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,519
malleable and how they get the the resin

823
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,119
to be warm before they use it you know

824
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,278
all that different types of stuff and

825
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,798
like and so there's a lot to learn from

826
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:08,319
those people

827
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,720
you know because they've been smoking

828
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,960
hash for a long time

829
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,759
yeah you know and like we you know we

830
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,000
stumble upon all this stuff and we think

831
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,519
we're doing amazing because you can see

832
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,119
through you know we want to put it on a

833
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,679
piece of parchment paper and be able to

834
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,359
see through it yeah we want to make it

835
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,519
off fresh frozen

836
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,678
harvested fresh frozen put into this

837
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,679
thing put through a freezer dryer all

838
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,840
this different stuff and

839
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,278
you know um you know frenchy people

840
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,119
talking about frenchie and stuff like

841
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,000
that and he did bring a little bit of

842
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,959
the

843
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,359
of

844
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,399
of of that different culture into all

845
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:47,278
this you know but there's an aspect of

846
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,000
um you know the the old-timers will tell

847
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,558
you

848
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,558
that you would store the hash in like in

849
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,960
loose bags right

850
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,359
in a cold spot and they said if you

851
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,399
wanted to ruin your hash you put it in

852
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,359
the fridge

853
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,599
yeah

854
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,278
and and the fridge and the humidity and

855
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,158
the [ __ ] would ruin your [ __ ]

856
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:05,839
hash

857
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,000
they were like if you wanted to ruin it

858
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,319
just just do that to it but if you put

859
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,640
it into a cold dry cellar and you let it

860
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,240
age for a while

861
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,600
boom

862
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,919
it would get better

863
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,759
yeah you know and

864
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,120
you know and so and they also grow with

865
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,720
a bunch of different cultivars that

866
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,278
we're not used to

867
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,640
yeah that's very true too

868
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,960
you know um and you know and they you

869
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,080
know they grow from seed every year

870
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,759
yeah right and we don't we grow from

871
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,960
clones

872
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,038
you know yeah um and so we've gotten

873
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,480
really especially on the west coast you

874
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,960
know um

875
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,278
we've gotten really egotistical

876
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,798
about our hash making yes and about our

877
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,640
extracts and we are you know we are

878
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,879
doing better i'm not i'm not saying that

879
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,159
like what we do isn't viable

880
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,840
i'm just saying that like from the

881
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,760
people in amsterdam that have vast

882
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,720
experience with both

883
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,240
yeah

884
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,919
they all prefer

885
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,399
the traditional [ __ ] if they can get the

886
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,759
grade they want oh i'm sure so that

887
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,119
should say something

888
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,440
okay people are asking the title of the

889
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,678
book and and someone did point out the

890
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,399
attorney app maybe isn't so well liked

891
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,440
but um this is with uh lawrence cherniak

892
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,119
and allen dronkers it's called

893
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,960
uh how she used the joy of making and

894
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,479
curing it's i was just putting up some

895
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,240
pictures to illustrate as we were

896
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,640
talking about how she used the different

897
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,120
styles looks

898
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,640
techniques in here but yeah people used

899
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,439
to sit there and i don't know if you can

900
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,240
see my hand or whatever um but like you

901
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,480
can they would sit there and rub and rub

902
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,720
and work and work and work and really

903
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,079
get the hash warm and malleable

904
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,839
sometimes people would put it into a

905
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,918
plastic bag and they would put it in the

906
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,639
heel of their shoe yeah and they would

907
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,480
walk on it to like work and work and

908
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,399
work and they wouldn't just sit there

909
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,079
and you'll see videos on ig now because

910
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,759
there's people that are going around

911
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,079
afghanistan and pakistan and some of

912
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,919
these hash cultures

913
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,119
of how before they use it they heat it

914
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,278
up

915
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,798
they work it they get it to be they get

916
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,880
it to be a certain way so there's a lot

917
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,480
of there's a lot of uh

918
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,480
there's a lot of old techniques that i

919
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,839
think are kind of being ignored

920
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,720
yeah that

921
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,079
um

922
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,558
you know it's almost like this [ __ ]

923
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:19,038
where like in california in the 70s

924
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,079
people knew about red and white wine

925
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,079
yeah

926
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,319
you know that was that was the level of

927
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,759
knowledge that like red went with

928
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,759
with prime rib and meat you know and

929
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,679
white was for their wife

930
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,398
and went with fish or chicken or

931
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,480
something and that's about all they knew

932
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,959
yeah and now you fast forward 30 years

933
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,839
or 40 years or whatever and now it's

934
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,200
like they're like oh merlot and this

935
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:46,798
appalachian and the pinot gris that's

936
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,798
that um you know that uh

937
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,679
that's all going on

938
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:53,918
and and whatnot and you know i think the

939
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,320
same thing is going to happen with hash

940
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,278
yeah we're a baby hash culture in

941
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,278
america

942
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,278
and we don't know [ __ ] and we're

943
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,880
learning stuff and every few years you

944
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,278
can see hash culture and you can see

945
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,640
people's techniques improve

946
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,278
yeah right

947
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,559
um but we could learn a lot from

948
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,720
you know and maybe they'll get to a

949
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,440
point like with the legality of things

950
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,278
or whatnot where you could grow a field

951
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,720
yeah like it would be cool for seed

952
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,159
makers right where you could grow a

953
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,679
field

954
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,039
of uh

955
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,038
of seeds

956
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,319
yeah and then harvest the whole thing

957
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,000
for hash

958
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,398
yeah that would be awesome and then you

959
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,720
get the full range of whatever you know

960
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,678
matt's bubble berry or or yeah you know

961
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,600
a skittles hybrid or a gmo hybrid or

962
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,600
whatever the case may be you'd get the

963
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,000
full range in the hash

964
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,839
uh instead of just like this one cut i'm

965
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,720
going to concentrate what's in this one

966
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,158
cut

967
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,480
yeah because that's never been done

968
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,760
before right yeah so that's telling me

969
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,599
how it's done over there it's not

970
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,359
typically how it's done over there and

971
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,959
so we have we have our own thing and

972
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,398
it's not bad or anything like that i'm

973
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,640
not saying that but

974
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,199
it it's very different

975
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,919
yeah it's very different now

976
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,200
we could expand it out a little bit

977
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,640
and talk about

978
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,559
um when

979
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,159
when they first started bringing afghans

980
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,480
you know we all started growing sativa

981
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,599
in america right yeah

982
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,519
because

983
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,480
sativa seeds came free with the [ __ ]

984
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,918
wheat

985
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,199
yeah you get kilos of you know headstash

986
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,799
brought in and everyone's selling it

987
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,279
your weed came with

988
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,639
free seeds yeah we used to sit there in

989
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,879
high school leaning back against the

990
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,960
chair and we'd have a we'd have a tray

991
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,878
and you'd break up the weed up here and

992
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,679
you let all the seeds and stems roll

993
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,598
down

994
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,358
and yep keep and you keep your weed up

995
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,200
there right but

996
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,878
hash didn't come with free seeds

997
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,638
yeah yeah

998
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:48,000
so i was just watching someone tell a

999
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,000
joke about bubble man

1000
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,358
so we don't have we don't we don't we

1001
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,719
didn't get very many seeds so

1002
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,719
you know

1003
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,158
sativas were all everywhere everywhere

1004
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,399
in the 70s and 80s and that was

1005
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,079
primarily what it all was how do you

1006
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,800
think puck washes

1007
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,800
how do i think like man you know

1008
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,400
if you wanna if you wanna if if there's

1009
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,640
people out there that don't like me and

1010
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,760
you wanna think of me as a shitty grower

1011
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,199
i should show you some pictures of uh my

1012
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,440
puck grows

1013
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,439
uh because i did some i did some depths

1014
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,039
and i did some greenhouse outdoors with

1015
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,880
it and uh

1016
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,719
boy was it not impressive

1017
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,320
no i wouldn't wash it because there

1018
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,399
would be no reason to wash off of it i

1019
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,079
got it was it was a really ugly i mean i

1020
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,440
can't say what it looked like in the 80s

1021
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,400
or in the 90s when it was a little

1022
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,800
younger

1023
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,240
um but you know when i got it it hated

1024
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,519
sunlight and food

1025
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,199
yeah

1026
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,480
and you know strangely enough those were

1027
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,399
two things that i liked to give my

1028
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,480
plants sunlight and food at the time so

1029
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,480
yeah yeah it was uh it was really

1030
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,800
unusual um

1031
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,320
you know and uh

1032
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,160
you know they uh

1033
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,760
so there's you know bubble hash and

1034
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,118
there's another aspect of it too where

1035
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,160
it's like maybe we should we could talk

1036
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,599
about this for a second is that

1037
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,759
most people

1038
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,599
most most americans i was going to say

1039
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,160
white people but most americans will say

1040
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,119
it that way right yeah like we don't

1041
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,118
like our time is our time is money

1042
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,760
you know so you look at the way

1043
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,280
traditional people sift sifting is an

1044
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,599
amazing product

1045
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,920
but it's the most time consuming

1046
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,800
yeah and it gets the least yield

1047
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,480
so

1048
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,720
it's the rarest

1049
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,480
so americans are constantly looking for

1050
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,759
can i wash this

1051
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,760
can i bho it can i co2 what what way can

1052
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,839
i do it that's efficient

1053
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,000
and i can get an extraction that yields

1054
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,838
what how can i get yield

1055
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,679
right well most of the time you have to

1056
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,799
put that through a solvent

1057
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:43,279
it's not just knocking the flowers

1058
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,119
yeah over a screen and getting and

1059
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,359
getting dry sift and then putting that

1060
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,320
dry sip through a series of screens and

1061
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:52,559
cleaning it up like bubble man as shown

1062
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,640
right even water is the salt water is

1063
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,000
the original solvent

1064
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,239
that's why it's so funny that people

1065
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,800
call water solventless

1066
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,879
water hash is solventless like look

1067
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,440
put in is water a solvent into google

1068
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,480
and see what comes up yeah

1069
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,240
it's a solvent yeah sure is the original

1070
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,240
and what's crazy about that is if you

1071
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,000
read now granted

1072
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,078
there's a lot of there's a there's some

1073
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,320
thc and terpenes and stuff like that

1074
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,280
aren't soluble in water

1075
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,838
yeah

1076
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,119
but there is if you read like uh rob

1077
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:27,519
clark's book hashish about 25 of

1078
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,480
terpenes are water soluble

1079
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,119
yeah

1080
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,838
so you can so there's times when we did

1081
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,280
stuff with water hash right where

1082
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:36,719
you run something like some kind of

1083
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,599
tangy cross

1084
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,000
yeah

1085
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,400
and that and that citrus that citrus

1086
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,320
comes through super strong

1087
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,119
right yeah but then you run something

1088
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,359
like the 56 day headband and it comes

1089
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,680
out smelling like axle grease

1090
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,400
yeah it's super potent

1091
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,879
but it's like chemical process didn't

1092
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,039
like it's it the chain that makes up the

1093
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,640
the aroma and the taste

1094
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,239
didn't make it through the hash making

1095
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,279
process

1096
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:08,000
right so most of the stuff we do today

1097
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,560
whether it's bho or whether it's water

1098
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,719
hash and then frozen or this or that a

1099
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,279
lot of these things affect the flavor

1100
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,598
and a lot of what becomes popular

1101
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,760
is what keeps its flavor

1102
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,559
with the time saving techniques that we

1103
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,599
use to make hash extraction easier

1104
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,759
yeah

1105
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,838
you know i mean you watch you watch

1106
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,440
these guys like on ig or whatever then

1107
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,440
you see them do their traditional hash

1108
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,358
thing no american wants to be sitting

1109
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,679
there with a face mask on for eight

1110
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,039
hours a day over a thing

1111
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,598
shaking

1112
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,800
flour and knocking off the crystals and

1113
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,320
then carefully you know like refining it

1114
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,440
it doesn't get you enough weight for

1115
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,559
your time

1116
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,280
yeah

1117
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,358
people we want to use machines

1118
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,400
well that changes it too

1119
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:53,598
yeah

1120
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
right

1121
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,400
yeah

1122
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,159
and part of the reason why i think like

1123
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,760
the tangy and the whole to mention that

1124
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,279
again the tangy and the whole citrus

1125
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,280
craze happened

1126
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,519
is because when

1127
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,160
like you know in the mid 2000s you

1128
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,759
couldn't give away calio

1129
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,838
no

1130
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,280
if you had citrus weed that was a great

1131
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:14,639
way for your broker to look at you and

1132
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,240
say nah dog

1133
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,358
yeah not a dog i don't need that

1134
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:19,679
headache weed

1135
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,000
i'm not taking your weed you know but

1136
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,399
then and it was also citrus weed tends

1137
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,239
to not be that potent yeah

1138
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,519
so it's it's you know you could call it

1139
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,159
i don't want to say minzy but you could

1140
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,639
say moderately potent at best

1141
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,598
yeah where the flavor people did blank

1142
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,440
lacking recreational potency yeah but

1143
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,160
then

1144
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,240
you start extracting it with bho or this

1145
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,559
or that or whatever and all of a sudden

1146
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,879
that that citrus terpene came through

1147
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,480
super solid and now the shit's 70

1148
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,800
percent thc

1149
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,679
yeah and it actually gets you high

1150
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,359
yeah and so a lot of the popular strains

1151
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:59,279
in america that got made into hash um

1152
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,279
got made into hash because after you put

1153
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,040
them through the the processes that we

1154
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,200
do to make life easy

1155
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,199
yeah still tasted and worked good

1156
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,240
you know but the but the old like the

1157
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,159
old static tech and the old like and the

1158
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,639
old sifting tech that was like used

1159
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,159
forever that wasn't abandoned because it

1160
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,559
sucked it was abandoned because it was

1161
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,239
lower yield and took a lot more time

1162
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,239
yeah

1163
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,239
and amer and you know most hash guys

1164
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:29,199
like to make their money quick right

1165
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:32,000
yeah turn it over i want to turn it over

1166
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:35,118
you know and so you get like what you

1167
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,880
think is the world's most amazing hash

1168
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,318
the hash collectors in europe don't

1169
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,720
think you're smoking the world's most

1170
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,559
amazing hash yeah that's not that it's

1171
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,399
not good

1172
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,199
and everybody can have their opinion you

1173
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,318
know

1174
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,480
yeah they just have a different

1175
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,159
perspective on it and

1176
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,838
more

1177
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,358
man it's hard to say a bit more cultured

1178
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,039
at some points when it comes to hash

1179
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,719
specifically

1180
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,480
i mean it's one of those things like

1181
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,598
like that's why you can compare it to

1182
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,599
wine

1183
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,920
yeah you know it's like

1184
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,160
now in california you can have all these

1185
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,000
wine nerds that are extremely

1186
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,279
intelligent about the different grapes

1187
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,760
and the different grades and the

1188
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,839
different appellations and where certain

1189
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,599
varieties do better than others because

1190
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,719
of climate

1191
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,318
yeah in the 70s it was red and white

1192
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,000
and that's kind of where we are hashish

1193
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,318
wise right now we're just learning and

1194
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,079
like anybody who's listening right now

1195
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,400
like you know who's made hash for the

1196
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,680
last 10 or 15 years think about how much

1197
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,358
your techniques and what you've been

1198
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,318
doing has been changing

1199
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,880
every year or two this whole time it's

1200
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,400
not like you've reached the mountaintop

1201
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,400
you know it's like people figure out a

1202
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,480
way to do it better and then people are

1203
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,318
like oh [ __ ] i'm going to do it that way

1204
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,079
yeah and a lot of the traditional ash

1205
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,559
people tell me that most of the modern

1206
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,119
cultivars that we grow with suck as far

1207
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,960
as hash extraction

1208
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,880
where you get some yeah where you get

1209
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,480
some lebanese [ __ ] you get some nepalese

1210
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,640
stuff that for generations has been

1211
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,240
grown just for that

1212
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,759
and that [ __ ] dumps

1213
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,039
yeah

1214
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,040
you know because that's what they

1215
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,519
designed it to do

1216
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,079
and when when the hash revolution hit 10

1217
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,759
12 years ago you know um

1218
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,599
people started looking around for all

1219
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,280
the elites that had been kept around and

1220
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,440
do any of these also dump hash yeah

1221
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,359
they weren't bred for that

1222
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,838
no one ever thought of it

1223
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,279
hash was like uh you know hash was like

1224
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,119
a personal product

1225
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,640
yeah maybe you could get some key for

1226
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,599
the club maybe you should get some water

1227
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,199
hash at a club you know um people would

1228
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,880
get scissor hash

1229
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,480
you know if you were working or people

1230
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,400
would get finger hash when they were

1231
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,559
bucking down stuff and all that but it

1232
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,599
wasn't like commoditized

1233
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,000
right

1234
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,240
did you ever use an iso too oh god yeah

1235
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,760
i want i want one of those to try out if

1236
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,239
any of you guys out there have an iso 2

1237
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,880
i will trade you some seeds for one uh i

1238
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,279
used to use my dad's as like a he-man

1239
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,519
castle along with my group

1240
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,920
castle grayskull and [ __ ] but i'd really

1241
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,838
like to see how it works today you know

1242
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,720
we could probably do a we could probably

1243
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,880
do a whole show one time on just the

1244
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,679
different eras of like oh that sounds

1245
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,760
cool

1246
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,440
yeah oh i'm gonna go on an octagon oh

1247
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,839
i'm gonna grow areaponics oh i'm gonna

1248
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,800
grow nft oh i'm gonna grow this way oh

1249
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,599
i'm gonna extract that way oh yeah you

1250
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,599
know coliseums yeah colosseums i mean

1251
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,359
dude i had to call it i had two coliseum

1252
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,720
i mean we could go through all that of

1253
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,358
just all like whatever is the most

1254
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:31,598
cutting-edge [ __ ] imaginable you know do

1255
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,679
you remember the v tables the the they

1256
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,280
were like that yeah yeah i remember one

1257
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,279
of those popped up there's a pencil and

1258
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,800
so it's funny right because a lot of my

1259
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,880
friends are egotistical or whatever you

1260
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,119
know but it's like the the main you talk

1261
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,400
to hash people in california and the

1262
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,680
west coast now and they think they're

1263
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,280
the best hash people that have ever

1264
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,960
lived sure

1265
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,720
that they dominate

1266
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,318
you know and i'm not dissing them

1267
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,399
because they are figuring stuff out and

1268
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,079
they are making nice hash

1269
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,440
yeah right most of them are failed

1270
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,440
growers [ __ ] them

1271
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,679
they're also turning their back on

1272
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,960
thousands of years of humans learning

1273
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,159
[ __ ]

1274
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,400
yeah

1275
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,000
you know and and it's it's like it's

1276
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,160
like when you're shocked when old people

1277
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,960
have something to teach you

1278
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,838
yeah

1279
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,440
you know yeah uh you know there's

1280
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,279
there's there's techniques and there's

1281
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,159
things and there's aspects

1282
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,440
um you know that uh you know i mean

1283
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,799
think about all those classes that

1284
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,559
frenchie did

1285
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,359
yeah

1286
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:27,039
just

1287
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,598
are you supposed to be

1288
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,519
you know and he was and he all he was

1289
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,280
doing was just

1290
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,559
teaching some people

1291
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,400
how

1292
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,358
different cultures over there made some

1293
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,800
hatch

1294
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:39,759
yeah

1295
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,079
you know

1296
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,280
and people ate it up

1297
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,640
yeah they did

1298
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,800
you know and there's different flavor

1299
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,799
profiles and there might be a way where

1300
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,560
you take a cultivar and you extract it

1301
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,440
one way and it fights potent but it

1302
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,480
sucks

1303
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,760
and then you do it another way and it's

1304
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,519
amazing

1305
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,880
so it's not like all strains react the

1306
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,759
same like something like i said some

1307
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,400
things go through water like a champ

1308
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,240
right i even did [ __ ] where i would have

1309
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,240
like a a greenhouse

1310
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,838
full of the same strains and then i

1311
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,519
would have outdoor

1312
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,440
yeah and like sometimes like the sour

1313
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,800
diesels and certain things like that if

1314
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,880
they got rained on a bunch in october

1315
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,519
their terpene profile wouldn't be

1316
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,519
exactly what i was after yeah but the

1317
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,440
sour diesel grown 30 feet away in a

1318
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,519
greenhouse that never got rained on once

1319
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,318
was fed with the same food and the same

1320
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,159
everything would be bomb

1321
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:33,599
you know but like the super silver haze

1322
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,519
or certain citrus stuff it wasn't

1323
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,760
affected by the rain at all

1324
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,159
yeah it just kept its profile but

1325
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,319
sometimes the rain enough rain would

1326
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,358
[ __ ] up the flavor on my weed

1327
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:44,559
yeah

1328
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,358
you know

1329
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,960
um and uh well you know someone just

1330
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,838
said it's potent but it sucks that's the

1331
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,000
biggest oxymoron ever not really it

1332
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,559
depends because it depends on how

1333
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,239
it depends on how you

1334
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,799
what the high is like

1335
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:03,598
yeah right i mean quality of high you

1336
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,519
can read old high times right and not to

1337
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,599
bring up high times but

1338
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,440
uh a lot of people's opinion of the old

1339
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,920
afghani one

1340
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,079
was that it was uncomfortable anxiety

1341
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,480
inducing body high that gave you heart

1342
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:19,280
palpitations and it was one of the least

1343
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,480
enjoyable smokes out there yeah and they

1344
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,560
way preferred sativas or normal or nl's

1345
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,679
or there was lots of other highs that

1346
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,318
they liked

1347
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,598
yeah they thought it was potent but they

1348
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,759
didn't like it

1349
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,960
yeah you know some people like some some

1350
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,160
people the

1351
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,318
that sativa buzz that nl5 haze buzz or

1352
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:39,679
that neville's haze buzz it's super

1353
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:41,358
potent it makes them want to crawl out

1354
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,358
of their skin and jump off a bridge and

1355
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,039
die and they'd never smoke it again if

1356
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:46,960
you know they hate it yeah that's like

1357
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:49,199
me with skunk one types they [ __ ]

1358
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,679
hate it it's super potent it's amazing

1359
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:53,118
it's the nicest sativa i've ever smoked

1360
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:56,318
but there's people that are smoking a

1361
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,000
couple of times and they'll be like i no

1362
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:58,800
that's a bad time for me

1363
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,880
so

1364
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,640
you know potency is just one aspect it

1365
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,920
just means it's strong it doesn't mean

1366
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:05,358
that it's going to affect you in a

1367
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,159
pleasant way

1368
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,679
yeah you know i personally i don't like

1369
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,679
edibles

1370
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,239
yeah oh no you can't control the high

1371
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,759
you can't you're just strapped in

1372
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,759
because and the reason why i don't like

1373
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,319
edibles and i'll be perfectly honest is

1374
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,079
that they [ __ ] with my equilibrium

1375
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:23,279
oh really they give me this like you

1376
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,119
know when you're drunk and you're like

1377
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,599
if i put a foot on the ground i'll stop

1378
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,960
the spins yeah yeah they can give me the

1379
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,160
spins

1380
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,920
that's enough and i don't like that

1381
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,199
feeling yeah and i'll have friends

1382
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,880
that'll be like oh you just got to eat

1383
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,960
enough and blow past it

1384
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,039
yeah and for me i'm like well how how

1385
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,920
many hours of uncomfortable do i have to

1386
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,039
feel before i start feeling good yeah

1387
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,318
because

1388
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:45,838
i don't feel good

1389
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:47,920
yeah you know i like weed a whole bunch

1390
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,679
and i don't feel good at all

1391
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,440
you know so how many hours of my life do

1392
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,318
i want to not feel good

1393
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,039
yeah you know that happens to me enough

1394
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:59,279
you know so i don't do edibles because

1395
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,639
like i got kids and [ __ ] you know so

1396
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,280
you know one of my kids could break

1397
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,318
their toe or whatever and yeah

1398
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,760
it doesn't matter how much weed i've

1399
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:07,039
smoked i can hop in the car i can take

1400
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,280
him to the hospital i can do whatever i

1401
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:12,800
need to do yeah but if i just ate a

1402
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,640
couple hundred milligrams of edibles

1403
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,559
i might need to like call a lifeline you

1404
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,279
know or yeah for sure

1405
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,800
i'm not you know

1406
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,000
and then yeah i have all kinds of people

1407
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,359
are going to start commenting oh you

1408
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,519
just need to take these you just need to

1409
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,358
ate these i'm just saying that for me

1410
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,519
the way my body works

1411
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:30,318
sometimes it gives me the spins

1412
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:32,079
yeah

1413
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:33,440
and i don't like the spins i think a lot

1414
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,839
of people don't understand that though

1415
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,400
how how variable the everybody's brain

1416
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:41,039
chemistry is and how each individual

1417
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,039
cannabinoid or what have you interacts

1418
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,358
differently with everyone not everybody

1419
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,960
gets the same effect from the same clone

1420
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,039
though you know i mean collectives

1421
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,880
that's the way people are tied i'll all

1422
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,639
indicates do this all sativas do this

1423
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,800
all hybrids do right in the middle you

1424
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:57,440
know it's just yeah it's just it's just

1425
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,079
not that way i mean i i chem 91 is one

1426
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,000
of my all-time favorite highs

1427
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,200

1428
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,519

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,960
that a lot of other people like it but i

1437
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,240
wouldn't like to smoke it on a regular

1438
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,838
basis yeah but i love it

1439

1441

whatever that might be the best way for

1458
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,000
them to absorb

1459
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,160
yeah

1460
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,480
i got a pretty funny pretty funny story

1461
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,639
about boofing stuff so i had a friend

1462
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,639
named brian he's dead now but he had

1463
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:17,279
heard that if you boof oxycontin and

1464
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,960
granted that we were like 17 18. you

1465
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,559
heard that if you boof oxycontin you get

1466
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,079
really [ __ ] up and this is the early

1467
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,880
days of oxycontin

1468
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,440
so he stuck the oxycontin up his ass and

1469
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,599
waited and waited and then he realized

1470
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,358
that there's a coating on the outside

1471
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,880
that it really won't penetrate through

1472
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:35,199
your [ __ ]

1473
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,200
so he had to crush it up and reinsert it

1474
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,519
into his ass

1475
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,960

is boofing

1481
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,079

cancer patients and aids patients and

1492
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,880
other various aspects

1493
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,439
and i'm sure

1494
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,079
that uh they do a great job

1495
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,240
um but what people also should know too

1496
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,079
is that when you eat when you eat weed

1497
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:24,879
yeah or you take it you know a

1498
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:27,519
suppository style it turns into thc 11.

1499
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,280
okay did you know that no i didn't it

1500
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:32,318
converts into something when you smoke

1501
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,519
it it's it's delta 11 thc delta 11.

1502
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,800
that's right

1503
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:39,039
and uh it's much longer lasting

1504
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,800
you know um and so that's kind of why

1505
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,199
you get [ __ ] like in the sense of like

1506
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,640
if if it hits you the wrong way

1507
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,159
yeah you're sort of stuck with that

1508
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,400
feeling for a while

1509
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,679
yeah and so me and delta nine are real

1510
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,559
good friends

1511
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:52,639
yeah

1512
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,400
nine in me we get along we see we see

1513
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,318
eye to eye on things

1514
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,000
i can smoke whatever format even you

1515
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:59,920
know i don't i'm more of a flower person

1516
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,519
than hash but i can smoke a bunch of

1517
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,280
hash and i can still accomplish whatever

1518
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,519
i need to do

1519
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,960
11 hydroxy not delta that makes sense

1520
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:11,440
okay yeah 11 i maybe i misspoke but um

1521
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,639
but yeah it it converts in your gut into

1522
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,720
something different

1523
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:15,759
okay and it's longer lasting and it has

1524
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,118
a

1525
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,119
some different effects

1526
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,599
well yeah doesn't it um bind with your

1527
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,000
fat cells too which makes it more potent

1528
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,240
in your stomach now we're getting into

1529
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,838
into areas i'm not familiar with

1530
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,279
yeah you know it's one of those things

1531
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:30,880
where i don't care about edibles that

1532
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,599
much because i don't

1533
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,000
um i don't uh i don't use them they're

1534
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,440
not that important to me you know i i do

1535
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,039
think that they're a great way for some

1536
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,159
people to get medicine

1537
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,318
yeah you know

1538
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:45,118
but i i got [ __ ] to do and i got kids

1539
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,719
and i can't take myself out

1540
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,880
yeah yeah it's a good way to take

1541
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,799
yourself out and you know to be honest

1542
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,400
like in the 90s and stuff like that you

1543
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,079
know uh

1544
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,358
now you can go to the you can go to the

1545
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,680
store and you can be like oh i'm going

1546
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:00,639
to get a 5 milligram or a 10 milligram

1547
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:02,799
or a 50 or 100 milligram you know yeah

1548
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,719
um and back in the day

1549
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,119
you know and you know when i was doing

1550
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,279
edibles more it was like is this ganja

1551
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,240
goo ball am i gonna feel anything

1552
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,319
yeah

1553
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,598
all the way up to i'm in my tent and i

1554
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,519
can't move

1555
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,559
yeah and i'm missing the festival

1556
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,880
because i'm horizontal

1557
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,720
you know yeah okay

1558
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,160
just chimera just answered he said no it

1559
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,159
crosses the blood-brain barrier more

1560
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,920
easily makes sense it converts in the

1561
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,838
liver not the gut which totally makes

1562
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,440
sense yeah yeah i knew i was gonna i

1563
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,639
knew i was gonna misspeak i knew that it

1564
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,880
affected you differently and it

1565
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,558
converted differently yeah um i was

1566
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,559
nervous to talk about the various

1567
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,160
science of it because i i wasn't i

1568
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,800
probably wasn't gonna get there yeah see

1569
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,639
i'm very um adventuresome and i'll talk

1570
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,240
about the science of it know exactly

1571
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,239
nothing what i'm talking about so i'm

1572
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,759
good at that part i just knew that it

1573
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,558
converted differently

1574
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,599
and it and it and it it lasted longer

1575
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,720
and it has a different series of effects

1576
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,720
uh than inhaling than smoking

1577
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:02,639
yeah i know someone said that um people

1578
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,358
with diabetes can't feel edibles and i

1579
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,440
can

1580
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,279
absolutely disprove that

1581
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,159
because i'm diabetic and i can feel

1582
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,760
animals

1583
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,519
yeah i mean i i've been on you know i've

1584
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,839
eaten some ganja goo balls at times and

1585
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,920
stuff and i i definitely i'm not i'm

1586
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,599
speaking more experience when

1587
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,599
i was like i'm in the tent and i can't

1588
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,599
move i can't stand up i need to pee am i

1589
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,318
gonna pee myself

1590
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,400
can i move yeah you know that's the good

1591
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:28,239
[ __ ] yeah because you know it's just

1592
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,079
like it's just bad dosing

1593
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:31,598
yeah these six kinds of goo balls are

1594
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,160
almost worthless and you wasted your

1595
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,160
money and this one is like catatonic

1596
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:38,558
yeah you know do you really want to be

1597
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,480
catatonic at a festival you know yeah i

1598
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,480
know that's how you get raised happens

1599
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,318
well no i mean not that i mean but it's

1600
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,079
but it's just yeah you paid money to be

1601
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:47,358
there and now you're laying on rocks on

1602
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,559
in a tent

1603
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:49,920
spinning

1604
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,798
you know

1605
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,720
um

1606
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,079
but it's just one of those things where

1607
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,759
it's like uh

1608
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,760
you know and actually too it's like it's

1609
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,880
interesting in the sense that i don't

1610
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,400
even know if i should bring this up but

1611
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,920
i have a i have a daughter that's i have

1612
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,720
a couple daughters in middle school

1613
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,240
right

1614
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,759
and it's one of their big issues right

1615
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,358
now

1616
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,240
is edibles

1617
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:09,679
really

1618
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,159
think about it it's taking animals to

1619
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,679
school yeah they're easy to mask

1620
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,960
an older brother an older sister or

1621
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:16,239
someone that's willing to go and buy

1622
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,639
them and kick them down

1623
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:20,879
yeah they're sour patch kids they're

1624
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,719
made in a bunch of attractive ways now

1625
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,640
like when we were kids the only way you

1626
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,798
got edibles is if some degenerate older

1627
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,318
brother made some brownies yeah exactly

1628
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:29,920
off some shake or something like that

1629
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:32,239
was able to stink up their whole house

1630
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,760
or some [ __ ] yeah now they can get like

1631
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,078
these really attractive much more

1632
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,440
controllable packages

1633
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,359
right there you're not going to get

1634
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,079
caught with a lighter or a pipe or

1635
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:44,798
stinking like weed or anything like that

1636
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,839
you can just eat like a 10 milligram

1637
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:49,920
yeah right and so they're a lot more

1638
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:52,318
prevalent makes sense nerds ropes sour

1639
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,880
patch kids rice crispy treats all kinds

1640
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:56,079
of there's an immense amount of of of

1641
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,599
baking

1642
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,760
and candy

1643
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,960
and [ __ ] and much more controllable

1644
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,079
amounts

1645
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,760
um that uh i just don't like it

1646
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,760
and i'm not what you're saying is kids

1647
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,319
are good customers

1648
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,079
no you know i just mean that kids kids

1649
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,838
are going to get access to whatever is

1650
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,920
cool that's available in their local

1651
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,279
area and it's easy to smuggle in i mean

1652
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,960
i remember back in high school they

1653
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,359
would do like locker raids and all kinds

1654
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,280
of [ __ ] trying to catch us dealing drugs

1655
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,440
and uh we didn't have things like you

1656
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,280
know gummy bears and [ __ ] like that yeah

1657
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,639
if you if you if you took out some of

1658
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,599
those gummy bears if you took out some

1659
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,039
sour patch kids from a from a an edible

1660
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,798
thing you got and you put them in a real

1661
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:37,119
sour patch kids thing and took them in

1662
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:39,358
your lunch box or your thing or backpack

1663
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,599
how would they [ __ ] know exactly yeah

1664
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:42,639
visible at that point you know

1665
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,400
um

1666
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,400
but you know so

1667
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,519
i just uh i just i just don't like

1668
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,720
edibles

1669
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,358
you know

1670
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,279
i just don't like edibles um but

1671
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,639
um we kind of got off we kind of got off

1672
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,920
track there or whatever but it's like a

1673
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:57,358
big thing

1674
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,440
you know and some people are into them

1675
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,960
but they steal they steal my they steal

1676
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,119
my equilibrium i don't know if they

1677
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,960
steal other people's equilibrium

1678
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,720
but i start

1679
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,480
not feeling the right way and then i get

1680
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:09,759
hot

1681
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,920
yeah and when you get hot and you have

1682
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,160
the spins i mean how fun is that yeah

1683
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,280
you end up puking that's enough it's not

1684
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:16,879
fun for me

1685
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,680
no you know

1686
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,599
but

1687
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,279
you know and i i think it'll probably

1688
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,798
take like it would probably take like

1689
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,920
international

1690
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:26,960
freedom

1691
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,440
where weed really becomes opened up

1692
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,199
you know yeah for americans

1693
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,760
over here at least to really start

1694
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,919
trying like the finest grades

1695
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,040
of imported hashish

1696
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,039
i just don't see i i see the

1697
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,639
the world opening up and it being so

1698
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,079
super corporate and hyper illegal that

1699
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:44,879
nobody's gonna be [ __ ] with [ __ ] like

1700
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,960
that

1701
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,240
you know it's gonna be in afghanistan

1702
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,480
they'll have

1703
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:53,118
those small clubs and all that [ __ ]

1704
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,400
it'll be just that culture infiltrating

1705
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,838
everywhere as opposed to letting the

1706
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,760
cultures that are there stay there being

1707
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:58,558
able to try each other's cultures

1708
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,079
uh

1709
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,319
who knows there's money to be made off

1710
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:05,839
this [ __ ] you know right now you know

1711
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:08,318
you can get you can get greek olive oil

1712
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:10,078
you know you can get those iberian hams

1713
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,880
that cost eighteen hundred dollars for

1714
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,400
the leg that have been dry aged x amount

1715
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,079
you know there's a lot to get

1716
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,400
you know what you can't get

1717
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,640
thai land races anymore it's very very

1718
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,079
hard things are disappearing not just

1719
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:23,920
the not just the strains but the

1720
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,519
cultures are disappearing with them in

1721
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,159
some senses and granted that's not a

1722
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,358
hash culture necessarily but it's just

1723
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:30,960
like just like those strains

1724
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,159
disappearing i mean it's you know the

1725
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,119
techniques are going to be going with

1726
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:34,159
them

1727
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,680
over time

1728
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:36,960
so you know people are saying people

1729
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,519
people are talking about people paying

1730
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,079
more for six star or whatever else so

1731
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:43,280
there's an aspect where

1732
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,720
you know there's obviously different

1733
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,920
grades

1734
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,078
right

1735
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,920
but no matter how pure you make it

1736
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,039
you're still limited by your starting

1737
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,798
material

1738
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:54,400
yeah are you all getting it from a

1739
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,318
single source

1740
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,400
right is it all the same cultivar is all

1741
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,079
the same cut are you getting it from a

1742
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,559
field are you getting it from uh you

1743
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,480
know you planted thousands of seeds and

1744
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,760
you're harvesting those females

1745
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,719
yeah you know

1746
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,480
um and uh and all that and so

1747
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:11,358
uh you know there's an aspect there

1748
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
where

1749
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:14,318
um

1750
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,000
you know because you're gonna cut hash

1751
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:17,838
is concentrated right

1752
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,358
yeah where you're gonna concentrate what

1753
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:21,119
was in the flower

1754
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,519
yeah you're going to concentrate the

1755
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:27,039
qualities of that of that thc or that

1756
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,480
blend or that cbd cbn terpene profile

1757
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,159
all that you know what do they call it

1758
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,240
entourage effect

1759
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:33,598
yes you know so you just you're going to

1760
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,598
get a vastly different experience

1761
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,640
probably from moroccan from lebanese to

1762
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,079
afghanistan to southeast asian to

1763
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:41,679
sherbolato

1764
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,039
yeah

1765
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:44,719
right

1766
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:45,838
yes sir sure

1767
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:47,519
sure

1768
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:49,519
and then a lot of times too people

1769
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:50,880
people still like even hash makers right

1770
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,318
now it's like oh my god this is

1771
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,400
unbelievable

1772
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,400
the terpenes off it are amazing but it

1773
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,440
yielded two percent so [ __ ] it i'm not

1774
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,559
gonna do it

1775
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,400
yeah right people want hash dumpers

1776
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,798
yeah it's gotta it's gotta be

1777
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,680
commercially viable

1778
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:07,519
first

1779
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,118
or it won't get beyond some small little

1780
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:10,880
circle there might be some there might

1781
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,480
be a few friends that like wash it and

1782
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,559
they're all trading grams amongst each

1783
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,119
other and all stoked but it won't

1784
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,798
trickle down to where the normal person

1785
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,760
can get it because it wasn't a viable

1786
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:21,920
amount

1787
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,920
exactly and i'm not a hash guy that that

1788
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,760
big or whatever but i do know from

1789
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,920
working in legal cannabis and stuff like

1790
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,520
that that there's minimum numbers of

1791
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,159
weight return that you need to get to

1792
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:35,039
make it be viable yeah to pay for your

1793
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,879
time to pay for the equipment to pay for

1794
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,880
the the shift work and all the stuff

1795
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,798
that goes into making hash so if it

1796
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,079
doesn't dump enough

1797
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:46,079
regardless of how nice it affects you

1798
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,680
yeah it's gonna get it's gonna get

1799
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,760
shifted to the side

1800
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:51,919
yeah and if you've got something that

1801
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,599
that blows your head off but it yields

1802
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,519
three and a half percent

1803
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,880
and it's sister plant

1804
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,719
tastes a little bit different and

1805
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,960
doesn't work as good but yields six

1806
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,639
percent yeah the six percent is getting

1807
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,000
run and washed all day

1808
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:07,279
yeah because that's making them money

1809
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,159
you know

1810
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,480
so

1811
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,480
um you know so there's that too where

1812
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,760
it's like the commercial side of it

1813
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,838
people might think oh we have the best

1814
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,200
hash in the world but unless it's

1815
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,960
commercially viable you'll probably

1816
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:20,480
never see it

1817
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,000
unless you're growing it and washing it

1818
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,760
and making it yourself

1819
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,159
yeah or in your small circle of friends

1820
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,160
and trading it amongst each other

1821
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,239
just like you know just like before like

1822
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,358
if you were growing a 12 or 13 or 14

1823
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,719
week plant

1824
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,798
you'd probably never be able to buy that

1825
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:36,879
in a store

1826
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,960
yeah i wouldn't think so gmo is probably

1827
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,640
the first thing that came out that took

1828
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,880
12 weeks

1829
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,639
that people were willing to jump on

1830
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,160
yeah that always shocked me especially

1831
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:47,440
coming from cookies

1832
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:48,558
well part of the reason part of the

1833
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,838
reason why i think people were willing

1834
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,000
to jump on it was because even though it

1835
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:53,599
took two weeks four weeks longer than

1836
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,639
they wanted or three weeks longer than

1837
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:59,200
they wanted it dumped like crazy

1838
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,798
yeah and it tested super high

1839
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:03,439
and it smelled like chem d and chem d

1840
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:05,119
was not everywhere yeah so it like so

1841
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,679
you know there so the yield made it

1842
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,280
worth it yeah right where if the yield

1843
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:10,239
doesn't make the extra time worth it i

1844
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,240
mean

1845
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:13,919
matt and i joke that like i mean there's

1846
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:15,598
some pretty famous breeders out there

1847
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,760
that are like if it takes any longer

1848
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,559
than 63 days it's [ __ ]

1849
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,400
yeah

1850
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,720
or i'm harvesting it early

1851
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,400
yeah i've got this banger colombian and

1852
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,159
it takes 11 weeks but i don't take it

1853
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,680
longer than 63 days because it doesn't

1854
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,679
fit my model

1855
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,679
yeah

1856
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,598
you know

1857
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,399
that's kind of how that rolls

1858
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,960
yeah

1859
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,119
and uh american way the american well

1860
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,599
it's just it's it's there's a difference

1861
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:43,599
between quality and commercial

1862
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,000
yeah and that's what i mean too about

1863
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,838
about like for instance the uh the wine

1864
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,679
industry is now there's enough education

1865
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:50,960
in the wine industry

1866
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,118
that

1867
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,400
a certain seven or eight year old

1868
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,240
cabernet

1869
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,200
from a certain winery in a certain

1870
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,679
region

1871
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:02,480
you can get that extra ducats

1872
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:04,000
to make that a viable product right now

1873
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,599
cannabis doesn't have enough of that

1874
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,679
separation

1875
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,400
to make the rare and the cool and the

1876
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:12,000
expensive worth it

1877
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,079
right there's all there's like this

1878
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,599
range that everybody's working in and we

1879
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,680
haven't gotten educated enough that you

1880
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,519
could be like you should pay more for

1881
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,078
this weed because it's neville's haze

1882
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:23,280
and it takes 15 weeks and you know it

1883
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,559
does this

1884
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,280
eventually you'll have people that are

1885
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,599
willing to throw down for that

1886
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,000
yeah right right now you don't

1887
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,440
right right now it's just it's it's you

1888
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,280
don't you know

1889
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,119
and so until you get that level of

1890
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,440
education until you get that consumer

1891
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,280
willing to pay for it i honestly think

1892
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,480
like the reason why

1893
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,720
people are going to yell at me for this

1894
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,199
but i think the reason why freaking uh

1895
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:48,239
hayes did so well in new york

1896
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,318
right

1897
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,879
was because there was there was

1898
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:54,960
musicians and rich people and wall

1899
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,760
street brokers to sell it to

1900
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,000
yeah

1901
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,319
they could they could sell them a higher

1902
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,519
grade

1903
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:05,119
yeah straight up just like that you know

1904
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:08,239
i mean do you think kush would have been

1905
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,119
so popular in in la if it wasn't 7 200 a

1906
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,798
pound wholesale oh yeah no never it was

1907
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,200
an aspect of it where

1908
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,798
where it became massive because in l.a

1909
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:19,759
it was like oh this is expensive and

1910
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,440
exclusive and it's not in your bag yeah

1911
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,280
and then people wanted what the what

1912
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,358
what people had it

1913
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,599
yeah right and people were willing to

1914
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:29,038
pay a [ __ ] ton for it

1915
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,200
but we really haven't gotten there with

1916
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,440
weed yet too much there's individual

1917
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,639
things that break through here and there

1918
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,119
but we really haven't gotten the

1919
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:39,598
criteria as to like why

1920
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,599
this weed or why this hash is nicer and

1921
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,880
should be more expensive

1922
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,838
yeah

1923
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,880
you know

1924
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,480
um

1925
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,079
you know i mean i even saw there was

1926
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,159
there was some [ __ ] i can't remember

1927
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,798
what it was i you know i see that uh you

1928
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,639
know chimeras on here he was talking

1929
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:56,239
earlier this week about he's got rks

1930
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:59,038
that he doesn't want to release

1931
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:59,838
because it's got unique traits in it

1932
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,920
that

1933
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:03,599
he wants to utilize later

1934
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,200
yeah and he doesn't think the market's

1935
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,960
ready for it

1936
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,480
whatever those traits might be

1937
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,280
you know

1938
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,798
and that could be that could be true too

1939
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,079
there's lots of times the market isn't

1940
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:15,920
ready for anything

1941
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,798
i've always been very good at being

1942
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,960
um

1943
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:20,719
at the forefront of stuff and absolutely

1944
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,079
making no sells being at the forefront

1945
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:23,919
of stuff and watching others come and

1946
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,119
clean up with it it's just about hitting

1947
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,639
it at the right time when the market's

1948
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,240
ready for something i mean we talked

1949
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,000
about that before too like all that

1950
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:31,519
super dog work that me and my and my

1951
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,480
homie did you know

1952
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:36,880
um that was like years before american

1953
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:39,599
seed sellers could really get a toehold

1954
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,720
yeah we had no place for it to go

1955
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:44,079
yeah

1956
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:45,279
you know we had no place for it to go

1957
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,039
you know

1958
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,400
so um

1959
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,079
uh you know it's it's got to be the

1960
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,200
right it's got it there's got to be a

1961
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:55,200
balance between commercially viable

1962
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,439
and fire

1963
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,519
yeah and it has to match

1964
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,039
you know so i don't know right now it's

1965
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:03,119
like we've been in that we we went to

1966
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,960
war with afghanistan for 20 years so

1967
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,798
it's probably not the uh

1968
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,318
um it's probably not the best time to go

1969
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:09,358
over there as a white guy

1970
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:12,318
and

1971
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:14,798
start looking around for hashish and and

1972
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,798
rare things like that you know yeah you

1973
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,798
can get taliban or whatever

1974
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,400
um but

1975
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,559
you know but uh

1976
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,519
um but they actually have a real culture

1977
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,599
over there

1978
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,960
yeah they have a real vibrant hashish

1979
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,119
culture

1980
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,039
and it's just separated from us

1981
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,280
you know it's always a trip to me with

1982
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,520
how how um

1983
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:38,160
religiously conservative those areas are

1984
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:40,559
but there still is a breeding culture or

1985
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:43,519
a weep culture there you know

1986
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,960
it is so counter to the muslim culture

1987
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:46,960
i just you know it's like i think it's

1988
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,318
one of those things where it's like uh

1989
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:53,199
it predated you know predated uh that

1990
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:55,119
whole thing yeah it's just it's it's it

1991
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:56,719
was just kind of like how

1992
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,480
you know like you know there's any

1993
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,719
number of different things where like

1994
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,358
christianity just absorbs certain pagan

1995
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:04,959
rituals into itself oh yeah that's true

1996
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,078
good because they because they couldn't

1997
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,159
get rid of it

1998
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,039
yeah they co-opted it

1999
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,960
right

2000
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,640
yeah so you want to bring you want to

2001
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,000
bring allah to

2002
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:15,838
afghanistan you're going to have to

2003
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,679
incorporate some hashish

2004
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:19,038
yeah because it's ancient there and they

2005
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:20,239
ain't getting rid

2006
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,280
yeah should have done that with

2007
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,519
christians

2008
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:26,160
you know better here yeah i mean well

2009
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:29,038
you know they i mean they it just it

2010
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,639
just didn't it's probably an anomaly

2011
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,640
yeah

2012
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,239
honestly yeah you know like it's an

2013
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:35,759
accident

2014
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:36,798
you know um

2015
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,319
and you know they probably didn't

2016
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:39,119
realize how much effect they were gonna

2017
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:40,719
have

2018
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,880
a thousand years later or two thousand

2019
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:44,879
years later i'm sure

2020
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,880
in the in in that regard

2021
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,160
you know yeah

2022
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,640
so

2023
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:52,879
but yeah i mean hash

2024
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,879
you know the the hash in america is

2025
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,838
moving along really quickly

2026
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,960
uh and i wish i could go back to

2027
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:03,519
um maybe i will sometime and go back and

2028
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,519
um and talk in in holland and stuff like

2029
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:07,358
that and see what what they have right

2030
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,119
now is their best stuff

2031
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:11,199
yeah that'd be interesting to know

2032
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,480
and just how it affects you

2033
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:14,558
yeah because that's what they all talk

2034
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,279
about is the the flavor and the effect

2035
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,279
is just un un used can't you just can't

2036
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,159
get it in other [ __ ]

2037
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:25,279
i'll be the judge of that [ __ ]

2038
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:27,119
you know yeah i don't know yeah

2039
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,400
but and they also even back when i was

2040
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,119
going back there a bunch it was like

2041
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,559
they would grab you know like you know a

2042
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:34,719
certain amount of kilos would hit

2043
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,000
amsterdam and it would all get bought up

2044
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,520
by collectors

2045
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,359
and then they all sit on it and hope

2046
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,759
that they didn't run out before they

2047
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,199
found something else of that quality

2048
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,960
yeah and so they'd have a chunk of this

2049
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,798
and a chunk of this and a chunk of that

2050
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,158
and you know so on and so forth and

2051
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:50,000
whatnot

2052
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,000
and that's what you know they'd smoke

2053
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,759
they'd smoke they'd almost keep flour

2054
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,600
for the americans

2055
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,119
yeah and then they said and then they'd

2056
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,159
show you what they really were we're

2057
01:08:57,119 --> 01:08:59,599
into

2058
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:00,879
yeah

2059
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,079
in that regard

2060
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,000
you know

2061
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:07,119
um and

2062
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,679
you know and so uh you know we're

2063
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:09,679
we uh

2064
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,519
i don't know maybe maybe there's a

2065
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,838
there's an aspect with america where we

2066
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,279
blend we blended a bunch of the smoking

2067
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:20,399
weed with a bunch of the hashish weed

2068
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,239
what do you mean

2069
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,318
huh what do you mean

2070
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:27,678
well you know we took stuff that was

2071
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:30,239
bred for smoking like thai

2072
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,880
colombia and and mexican and things of

2073
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,639
that nature and then we blended it with

2074
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,960
all this stuff that was

2075
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,920
specifically designed for hashish

2076
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,679
yeah

2077
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,600
like all the afghans that came over

2078
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:44,079
originally yeah

2079
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,440
that was all bred exclusively for they

2080
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,600
did they weren't going for like does

2081
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:50,238
this flower taste good

2082
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,039
yeah they never tasted the flour

2083
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,079
right

2084
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:56,079
yeah they hashed it

2085
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:57,198
but the hash had to taste have a taste

2086
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:58,719
of its own

2087
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:01,919
you know yeah but it's different it's

2088
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:04,158
different when you're burning aged hash

2089
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:07,199
that's versus versus like a bunch of

2090
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:09,119
flower material yeah

2091
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:11,439
you know and so we started figuring all

2092
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:13,119
that out and we started blending it with

2093
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,719
sativas and blending it with different

2094
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,359
things and trying to see how they all

2095
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,439
came out yeah you know it's weird in the

2096
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:21,519
sense that like america and holland sort

2097
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,919
of became the two places i should say

2098
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,679
canada too north america

2099
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,880
sort of became where like all the

2100
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:31,440
various regions of weed started blending

2101
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,239
yeah you could probably put australia in

2102
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:36,158
that category

2103
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:37,599
that sounds like it sounds like i don't

2104
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:39,519
have a lot of familiarity with over

2105
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,760
there but like it sounds like australia

2106
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,360
was another melting pot where they got a

2107
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,960
bunch of southeast asian weed and they

2108
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:46,000
got a bunch of uh

2109
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,319
um

2110
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,640
they got a bunch of indian and

2111
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,158
afghanistan and pakistan and blends of

2112
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,039
different stuff you know

2113
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:56,879
yeah and whatnot and so

2114
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,238
you know it uh

2115
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,000
and there was people too maybe we could

2116
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,399
switch we could switch bases for a

2117
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,960
second there was people that were asking

2118
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:07,198
which is more matt's world than mine uh

2119
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,198
i can let him talk for a minute about

2120
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:12,238
what the what the internet what the seed

2121
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:13,678
market is like outside of us like

2122
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:17,039
outside of the us

2123
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,800
outside of our like little sts reversals

2124
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,880
like what everyone's familiar with oh

2125
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,679
this guy's dropping caps dropping

2126
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,480
something matt's dropping something csi

2127
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:28,079
has a drop here comes these people you

2128
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,599
know because we're used to like very

2129
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:30,719
small scale

2130
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,480
um

2131
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,239
you know like and i think probably most

2132
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:36,158
people think of the last 10 years as

2133
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:38,479
what's normal

2134
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:39,359
yeah but that's not i would think so

2135
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:40,959
yeah

2136
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:43,039
but that's not really what's out there

2137
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,198
but you know obviously like so maybe you

2138
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:47,439
could talk for a minute about like what

2139
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:48,879
what is it like out there

2140
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:50,960
well i mean like

2141
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,239
so like someone like chimera that's been

2142
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,239
around before me he's gonna have a

2143
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:56,559
different experience than when i entered

2144
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,559
when i entered in you had to [ __ ] with

2145
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,320
europeans or your seeds weren't going to

2146
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,920
sell you know if you weren't [ __ ]

2147
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:04,079
with european seed bank and were trying

2148
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,319
to do direct you had a very very small

2149
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:07,760
chance of getting any meaningful sales

2150
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,439
because people wanted to buy from seed

2151
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,520
banks seed banks were known there wasn't

2152
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:13,519
a lot of places to do exchanges you

2153
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,280
could always you know do it get down in

2154
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,520
the dms on different forums and stuff

2155
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:19,359
but that was that was really not cool

2156
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,040
like it wasn't looked at as a cool thing

2157
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,920
to do by the the forum owners because

2158
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:25,760
they were they were kind of taking

2159
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,000
some risk for your exchange even though

2160
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,640
it was done in the dms it's still on

2161
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,640
their server and transactions so it

2162
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,840
wasn't looked upon positively by a lot

2163
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,159
of the the

2164
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,920
the uh forum owners for anybody to be

2165
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:40,479
doing any exchanges of any sorts and

2166
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,480
usually you'd get banned from uh places

2167
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:44,959
for doing anything of the sort

2168
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:47,039
um so we were we were

2169
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,039
mostly counting on um

2170
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:51,679
when i entered in it had just started

2171
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:53,359
the british and uh

2172
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,920
attitude wasn't a thing when i first

2173
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,519
started um but yeah most of it was

2174
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,079
outside of the us i think heaven

2175
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,000
stairway was was that canada or that or

2176
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:04,880
us

2177
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,238
i think uh canada

2178
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,600
i think it was canada

2179
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,238
where it was canada i believe was it

2180
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:13,280
canada where calrissian i believe so

2181
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:13,279
yeah i mean

2182
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,359
you had the canadian seed banks a lot of

2183
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:18,880
them wouldn't pick up american folks i

2184
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:20,719
remember um

2185
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,960
med user chris

2186
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:25,039
over at wood horse seeds he was really

2187
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,480
not friendly to most americans hemp

2188
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:28,158
depot

2189
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,559
was around but you still had a hard time

2190
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:32,559
getting them to pick up most americans

2191
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:36,080
so being an american you had the choice

2192
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:38,719
mostly of british or if you were lucky

2193
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:40,479
like a dutch seed bank would pick you up

2194
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,198
but yeah it's

2195
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:45,279
it was minimal a lot of it like when

2196
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:47,198
when i got booted off the attitude

2197
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:50,079
subcool had asked and basically gave

2198
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:51,519
that given them a uh ultimatum me or him

2199
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,600
and at the time there was just me and

2200
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,800
him that were the americans on there

2201
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:00,480
when i left the attitude and uh

2202
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:02,159
on unceremoniously left

2203
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,519
i had to to figure out what was i going

2204
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:05,279
to do is i going to take the risk be the

2205
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,679
one american trying to

2206
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:10,399
sell direct or was i going to just find

2207
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,640
another seed bank and get [ __ ] so

2208
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:15,679
first thing i did was try to operate a

2209
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,520
seed bank with a few other americans and

2210
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:20,560
unfortunately chose the brothel brothers

2211
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,280
who were notorious scammers and they got

2212
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,800
me

2213
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:25,119
and eventually i just learned [ __ ] i

2214
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,239
gotta do this myself or it's it's not

2215
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,640
gonna work

2216
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:30,639
and from there you know i mean you could

2217
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,239
be operating great in the u.s but if you

2218
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,920
weren't taking credit cards like the

2219
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:36,000
europeans then you just weren't going to

2220
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,880
be any sort of competition and those

2221
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,359
were always going to get the the sales

2222
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,520
nowadays it's a lot different nowadays

2223
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:45,839
there's all sorts of direct buying uh

2224
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,199
instagram kind of changed a lot you know

2225
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,600
instagram made everyone a lot more

2226
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,960
accessible um seeds were a lot easier to

2227
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,239
sell because people weren't as

2228
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,039
interested in effect they were more

2229
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:57,119
interested in learning uh by looking you

2230
01:14:55,039 --> 01:15:00,079
know oh that's pretty that look that

2231
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:02,800
looks dank became a real catchphrase

2232
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,679
during instagram oh that looks dank but

2233
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,880
i mean

2234
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,560
back in the day we kind of knew that

2235
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,199
looks didn't mean anything when it came

2236
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,480
to dangerous i mean yeah the weird thing

2237
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,039
let me interject for a second because

2238
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:15,759
i'm saying stuff in the comments is that

2239
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:17,439
america was an enormous seed market

2240
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,560
yes but everyone that tried to deal with

2241
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:21,198
america

2242
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,960
typically got in trouble yeah so

2243
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:25,519
everyone in europe you know when they

2244
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,640
saw what happened in neville um yeah the

2245
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,480
super sativa seed club just shut down

2246
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,400
and a lot of

2247
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:35,198
you know seed banks became very hesitant

2248
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:37,599
to ship stuff to america yeah and then

2249
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:40,238
canadian seed banks sort of took over

2250
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,560
that that role for a minute and started

2251
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:44,479
being willing to ship stuff to america

2252
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,080
um and a lot of times they sort of like

2253
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,399
took the reins from europe because

2254
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:49,920
europe would send it to canada

2255
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,879
you know and it would get and it would

2256
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:55,279
get filtered through but as uh you know

2257
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,960
camaro was mentioning a few minutes ago

2258
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:58,559
um heaven stairway went down because

2259
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,198
there was an intercepted shipment to the

2260
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,960
united states and that got cannabis

2261
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:04,000
world and overgrowth shut down at the

2262
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,840
same time

2263
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,279
and

2264
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,360
well and we we're going to do a full

2265
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:12,399
episode on this me and flan but it's

2266
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:13,359
we're going to go into detail on um silk

2267
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:14,879
road

2268
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:16,000
heaven stairway

2269
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,840
overgrow

2270
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,119
icy mag and how they were all related in

2271
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,000
the big bust

2272
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:23,599
this is over a period of several years i

2273
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,039
mean it's that people are still being

2274
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:29,199
prosecuted from one major [ __ ] up yeah

2275
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,519
and then that's one of those why i used

2276
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:32,559
to go to amsterdam to buy seed in the

2277
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,080
90s

2278
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,320
was because that was the most reliable

2279
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:38,000
way to get it uh getting it shipped over

2280
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:40,238
was very difficult you know and a lot of

2281
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,560
people wouldn't do it uh mark emery who

2282
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,399
had you know cannabis culture magazine

2283
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,719
uh and all that and he had his whole

2284
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,319
seed company um he ended up doing i

2285
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,760
don't know five-ish years or something

2286
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:52,559
like that in america

2287
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:54,400
in prison for seed sales

2288
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,199
um so there was a big issue with

2289
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:58,879
america's this voracious seed market

2290
01:16:57,198 --> 01:17:01,759
but how do you get

2291
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,719
seeds there without getting in trouble

2292
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,079
yeah

2293
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,000
and so

2294
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,399
you know there wasn't you know people on

2295
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,319
ig now you can see all these things and

2296
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,639
that's why i was joking about you know

2297
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:14,559
oh this guy's got a drop coming

2298
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,920
you know when 20 years ago or whatever

2299
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,280
when i was doing a bunch of breeding

2300
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,279
work

2301
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:20,238
there was no outlet to get that to

2302
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:22,238
anyone

2303
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:24,319
yeah there was no way to advertise it

2304
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,479
there was no way to set up shipping

2305
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:29,439
there was no way to i mean even like

2306
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,559
somebody like dj short who um

2307
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:31,839
ended up working with a bunch of

2308
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,199
canadians

2309
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,880
part of the reason why he worked with so

2310
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:36,559
many people was that in order for his

2311
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,520
sweet his stuff to get out there he had

2312
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,199
to work with tony from sag martha first

2313
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,960
yeah and then he ended up working with

2314
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,759
the dutch passion crew

2315
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,079
yeah

2316
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,600
i think a dutch passion and he ended up

2317
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,319
not liking that and then he ended up

2318
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,159
working with various people up in canada

2319
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,719
but he had to work with third parties

2320
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:57,759
because there was no way for him

2321
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:59,920
to safely distribute advertise and

2322
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,360
communicate with people from america to

2323
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,520
get seeds out

2324
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:06,960
yeah so it really wasn't until social

2325
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:09,280
media exploded and ig exploded and

2326
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,279
proposition 215 and medical started

2327
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:14,719
spreading enough that it started calming

2328
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:16,158
down yeah for all these seed companies

2329
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:19,198
like you know think about all the

2330
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:21,679
popular you know uh cap or or you know

2331
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:23,678
swamp boys or these people you know

2332
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,359
cookie anybody right

2333
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,760
all these people came up and their

2334
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:30,319
possibilities started

2335
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,880
in the social media ig

2336
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:35,279
yeah so what matt's talking about is how

2337
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,560
difficult it was as an american seed

2338
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:41,759
breeder to even find a home

2339
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:43,440
that could that could be a middleman

2340
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,560
that could get they could get your seeds

2341
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:48,319
out to people so you know my buddy

2342
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,760
that uh that i you know he doesn't like

2343
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:52,719
to be mentioned but my buddy i call

2344
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:55,119
staten island he kept talking about like

2345
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:57,520
the potential for seats

2346
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:58,319
and i was totally dismissive

2347
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,800
right

2348
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:03,759
and we were both right

2349
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,239
right at the time i was right

2350
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,520
what he saw 10 or 15 years down the road

2351
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:08,399
what was coming

2352
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,199
yeah

2353
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:12,879
you know he did he he saw it but it just

2354
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:15,119
wasn't there yet

2355
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,199
i remember making that that

2356
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:20,399
shift from um

2357
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:22,158
cash cropping i mean it's a very very

2358
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:24,158
clear memory for me when i had to make

2359
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:27,359
that choice of [ __ ]

2360
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:29,920
i can cash crop or i can make seeds i'm

2361
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:31,359
learning i cannot do both you know and

2362
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,840
having to make something that i know i

2363
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:37,439
know i can make enough money to survive

2364
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,600
growing since mia

2365
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,839
that's not what i love to do you know

2366
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,520
that way that did that slowly was not my

2367
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,600
passion anymore my passion was making

2368
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,520
seeds and and learning what i could

2369
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,560
create you know what could be created in

2370
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,960
these rooms and uh having to make that

2371
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,719
decision to only go to siege was a tough

2372
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,399
one because at the time they it was very

2373
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,719
risky there wasn't a lot of money in

2374
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:00,879
seeds i mean granted greenhouses killing

2375
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,198
it dna was killing it but americans just

2376
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,520
weren't killing it at that level yet i

2377
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:08,479
mean dna we can talk about dna for a

2378
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,199
second those are two americans plumber

2379
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:13,279
and the stunt cop yeah and they you know

2380
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:14,638
they they went to humboldt and mendo and

2381
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:16,639
all these different places and they

2382
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:19,359
gathered up a bunch of seed and a bunch

2383
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:21,279
of clones from various friends

2384
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:24,158
but they had to go to holland to make a

2385
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:26,639
seed company yeah there was no there was

2386
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,479
no in the early 2000s there was no way

2387
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,760
they were going to do an american-based

2388
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:31,759
seed company

2389
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,199
how would they even get a hold of you

2390
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,039
yeah how would you get a hold of them

2391
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:38,238
how would you not get busted

2392
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:40,960
yeah you know it was uh it wasn't it

2393
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:43,279
wasn't very easy and so we basically

2394
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,960
worked first through holland

2395
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:46,719
and that's kind of why holland became

2396
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,480
the epicenter

2397
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,039
was it allowed it

2398
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:52,559
yeah right neville got lucky because he

2399
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,880
had balls

2400
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,920
and a bunch of american breeders were

2401
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:01,199
fleeing prosecution in america

2402
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,119
and bringing him stuff right and you

2403
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:05,039
know he got stuff from from greg and he

2404
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:07,119
got stuff from sam skunk man and he and

2405
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:09,039
he got stuff through mel frank and jorge

2406
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:10,079
cervantes and he got stuff from jim

2407
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:11,920
ortega

2408
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:13,600
all these people

2409
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,800
you know because that was the place that

2410
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,639
it could go

2411
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,159
yeah and then when canada became the

2412
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,199
place it could go that's where it all

2413
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:20,960
went

2414
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:22,479
and then when california and oregon and

2415
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,239
washington started being the place that

2416
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:26,559
it could go that's where it went

2417
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,399
yeah and it really sucks

2418
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,039
because there's this artificial line

2419
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:33,439
between america and canada

2420
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:35,198
that sort of kept our two cultures it's

2421
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:36,399
made it a lot more difficult

2422
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:37,359
to

2423
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:40,638
huh

2424
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:43,039
i'm not gonna lie between 2007 and 2010

2425
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:45,119
the fact that it was such a small market

2426
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:47,600
it was [ __ ] killer he didn't have all

2427
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,679
kinds of competition i mean the the best

2428
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:52,079
competition i had was like swerve and

2429
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:54,560
sub at the time and rascal you know for

2430
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,559
americans and rascal was he was at the

2431
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,560
top of the the food chain when it came

2432
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,360
to reversals but i mean

2433
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:03,039
sub and swerve you know yeah no i i mean

2434
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:04,880
there's there's there's an aspect of it

2435
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,560
but it's like that

2436
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,480
you know um

2437
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,480
people think that like people don't

2438
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:13,439
realize how long it took

2439
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:15,919
to get to get democracy where some guy

2440
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:18,158
in a garage could have a 15 lighter or

2441
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,760
two or three four lighters or whatever

2442
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:20,719
yeah and make some breeding and do a

2443
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,119
drop

2444
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:26,719
yeah and advertise the drop

2445
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:28,639
and let uh and let everyone know

2446
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:29,920
that it was coming

2447
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:32,800
you know i was just thinking about

2448
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,800
something as far as drops go like i

2449
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,679
remember when that was looked at very

2450
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,600
negatively if you're gonna do a drop

2451
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,920
meaning you're gonna hit one male to

2452
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,520
more than five or six plants you were a

2453
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,760
shitty pawn chucker and that was like a

2454
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,520
mark of shame like drops were not a

2455
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,480
thing and now that's the common accepted

2456
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,920
way this clone or this male crossed x

2457
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,718
amount of clones and that's the accepted

2458
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:56,480
way but back in the day that was not you

2459
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,000
were not looked at favorably i mean

2460
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:59,839
that's what i did so i'm not looking

2461
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,079
down on anyone for doing it i was one of

2462
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,000
the people looked down on not favorable

2463
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:05,920
for doing those i mean we talked about

2464
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,319
it before but you know 12 or 14 years

2465
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,520
ago the four or five guys uh doing

2466
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:11,679
reversals

2467
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,040
were looked upon as cheating

2468
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,199
yeah it's cheating you're ruining the

2469
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:17,359
[ __ ] you are ruining genetics for

2470
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:19,359
good you're ruining the gene pool you're

2471
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:20,399
eliminating males you're taking

2472
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:21,920
shortcuts

2473
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:23,198
you're doing this [ __ ] up thing that

2474
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,679
shouldn't be done

2475
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,960
you're trying to do shortcuts to make a

2476
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:30,239
quick buck

2477
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,520
yep um and it went from that and it was

2478
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:32,959
you know i don't know

2479
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,600
uh

2480
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,279
emery is a douchebag i totally agree

2481
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:40,000
that he i think most people agree he's a

2482
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:41,920
gun that he is a he is a non-he is not a

2483
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,960
nice person um

2484
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:46,639
by any means um you know i mean but

2485
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,480
you know there's a there's a lot of

2486
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:50,319
people that uh you know you get to know

2487
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:52,479
him and weed and you're like oh boy

2488
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:54,559
yeah he's not a good kisser but yeah but

2489
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:56,479
there's an aspect where it's like like

2490
01:23:54,560 --> 01:24:00,080
we've talked about it what was it it was

2491
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:00,799
it was matt and rascal and hybe

2492
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:03,039
and

2493
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,560
uh a couple other a couple other people

2494
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:07,840
doing rehearsals

2495
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,120
yeah and it was a sea of of male female

2496
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,440
breeding

2497
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:12,960
and now fast forward 12 years and it's

2498
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:16,399
completely reversed

2499
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,239
yeah it's like 98 fems

2500
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:21,119
and two percent of people doing reg

2501
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:23,439
breeding yeah it's rare to see people do

2502
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:24,880
i've got a reg seedline drop

2503
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:27,359
you know what's really weird too for me

2504
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,800
like i i don't do that many um

2505
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:30,079
fem seed runs anymore i really don't

2506
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,279
even though i saw the spray and i've

2507
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:33,840
been doing it a long time people

2508
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:36,800
associate me with that i i don't do them

2509
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,319
often i don't do them very often at all

2510
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,239
and i prefer regular seed breeding

2511
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:42,880
because it's so much easier it's like a

2512
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:45,759
[ __ ] free pass to not fail

2513
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:48,480
and uh yeah it's it's it's a totally

2514
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,880
different than people's uh ideas of what

2515
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:54,079
fem breeding is and how easy it is it's

2516
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:56,560
uh regular breeding is easy

2517
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:59,840
in the sense of getting actual

2518
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,360
successful pollination

2519
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,119
with real not not that you're going to

2520
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:05,198
achieve your goals that's still the

2521
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:07,039
breeding is a lot of there's still a lot

2522
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:09,599
of dead ends and failure in my opinion

2523
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:12,158
and sure you know and all that but but

2524
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,719
you know feminized breeding even even

2525
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:15,759
getting pollen and getting viable pollen

2526
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:18,079
um

2527
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,520
you know uh people

2528
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:20,800
it's a crapshoot people are saying i

2529
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,560
don't think the market's telling

2530
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,279
breeders what they want

2531
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,120
no

2532
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,559
i don't necessarily i don't think that's

2533
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:29,679
it i think that

2534
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,280
finding males is a bunch of work

2535
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:33,359
and people

2536
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:35,599
started doing things where you can't get

2537
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:38,079
either one of these two elite cuttings

2538
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:40,960
but i'll give you a hybrid of them yeah

2539
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:42,719
you can't get tk by skittles

2540
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,960
yeah you know you can't get either cut

2541
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,560
but you can buy a hybrid from me

2542
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,279
and i think that's what started it and i

2543
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,880
think

2544
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:50,319
honestly it's like people buy what's

2545
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,039
available

2546
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:54,559
you know um and uh

2547
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:56,479
you know

2548
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,239
reversals just you just took an elite

2549
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:59,839
cut and you crossed it to another elite

2550
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,479
you took an elite cut and you threw that

2551
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,000
on 15 or 20 other cuts and boom you've

2552
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:06,799
got a seed drop

2553
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,439
yep and reversals actually really killed

2554
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,960
the the line breeding

2555
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:13,359
you know companies used to we were going

2556
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,639
to talk about simon today tonight right

2557
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:16,158
yeah we're going to talk about sirius a

2558
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:18,239
little bit or whatever

2559
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:20,960
uh serious seeds they offered the same

2560
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:22,718
six lines for like [ __ ] 15 years

2561
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,679
yeah 20 years

2562
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:27,760
you know uh scentsy seed bank you know

2563
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:29,279
uh when neville was there or whatever

2564
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,960
probably matt and i were looking at a

2565
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:33,359
bunch of the catalogs

2566
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:35,920
they barely offered a new line for five

2567
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:38,158
or six years yeah it was the same as

2568
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:40,560
[ __ ] and then in the late 90s they added

2569
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:42,638
two or three more lines yeah back in the

2570
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,199
day they expected you to work on your

2571
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:47,679
line and refine it hopefully

2572
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:50,559
and you have those flagship strains yeah

2573
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:53,039
make those lines better over time now

2574
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,719
it's literally like i did this reversal

2575
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:56,319
i got x amount of seeds they're here

2576
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,719
until they're gone i probably won't make

2577
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:59,519
them again i gave it a name

2578
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,600
yeah

2579
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,080
you know but

2580
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:06,400
that's it there's no lines you can't you

2581
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:08,158
can't hit up you know um you could hit

2582
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:10,079
up serious seeds throughout the 90s and

2583
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:11,759
you could get ak-47 and you could get

2584
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:13,198
white russian and you could get chronic

2585
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,239
and you could get bubble gum and you

2586
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:16,479
could get

2587
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:18,479
um you know whatever

2588
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:19,599
right and it was just on on it was just

2589
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:21,919
available

2590
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,600
so let me let me use this point actually

2591
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,359
to tell a story and you'll like this

2592
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,440
story because it it has something to do

2593
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:30,399
with you so

2594
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:32,238
i gave natso some seeds a while back and

2595
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:33,839
i i was pretty sure i remembered what i

2596
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:35,759
gave him right

2597
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,319
um i thought i gave him an old pack of

2598
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,760
ak-47 and i i was like man when's he

2599
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:41,920
gonna pop those [ __ ] and i

2600
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,840
would bust his balls over it like man

2601
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,880
where's those aka 47 get him pop he's

2602
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,679
like i don't know what you're talking

2603
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,760
about i'm like [ __ ] not so right so i

2604
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,840
bust his balls for at least a year and a

2605
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,400
half two years two years every time i

2606
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:57,520
lost his [ __ ] ancient seeds i'm the

2607
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:59,679
old seed guy i talk up ak like crazy all

2608
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,360
this different stuff he sends them to me

2609
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,199
not only do i not do anything with them

2610
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:05,439
but i [ __ ] them over by like not

2611
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:07,439
actually cracking them or like you won't

2612
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:09,119
crack them i just [ __ ] ignored them

2613
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:11,039
and then i lost them and i keep telling

2614
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,158
them i don't have them over and over and

2615
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:13,600
over again

2616
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:16,479
and i'm like dude i gave you these

2617
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,159
[ __ ] seeds what the [ __ ] so anyways i

2618
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:21,039
was busting his balls about him again

2619
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:22,079
probably i don't know a month ago yeah

2620
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:22,800
you know something like that not that

2621
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:24,079
long

2622
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,400
and someone i hadn't talked to for a

2623
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:27,679
long time skunk tech hits him up and is

2624
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:29,719
like hey you know i haven't talked to

2625
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:32,639
matt but let him know that i f2 those

2626
01:28:29,719 --> 01:28:35,439
ak-47 seeds he gave me so

2627
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:37,279
oh i was so happy too because i called

2628
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:39,919
that up and i was like you're a dick

2629
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:42,238
dude you gave them to someone else

2630
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,920
and [ __ ] me and told me that i [ __ ]

2631
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:46,559
lost them and i didn't remember and i'm

2632
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,719
a stoner and [ __ ] yeah yeah

2633
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:52,239
you know you said i sent rare [ __ ] from

2634
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,239
the 90s and i blew it off

2635
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:56,559
but in fairness he still does have super

2636
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,480
skunk and devil's haze over there

2637
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,320
but you know there's a there's a yeah i

2638
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:02,959
mean in fairness to me

2639
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,880
uh before 2017 there wasn't like

2640
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,119
biblical fires every year in my area

2641
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,039
yeah yeah yeah i don't mind the fires at

2642
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:10,639
all and so that that ruined a number of

2643
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:12,319
seed crops for me and gave me kind of

2644
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,679
some ptsd

2645
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:15,679
and all that

2646
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:18,639
but yeah i mean going back to going back

2647
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:21,359
to simon i mean can you imagine if

2648
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:23,039
you know whoever you know for the last

2649
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:24,799
five years the swamp boys have offered

2650
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,000
the same six lines

2651
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,840
yeah

2652
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,880
matt's offered the same six lines

2653
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,719
caleb's csi's offered the same 20.

2654
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,480
and they just remake them

2655
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,239
and that's what people are doing

2656
01:29:34,479 --> 01:29:38,238
yeah and you get you're expected to work

2657
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,839
on all those lines and improve them but

2658
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:42,000
you can because you're only offering

2659
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,880
half a dozen

2660
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
now every seed drop is like [ __ ] 20

2661
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,840
things

2662
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,119
yeah at least usually you know and

2663
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,400
they're all given a name and they're all

2664
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:51,760
given packaging and they're all given

2665
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:53,439
this and they're all sold and that's

2666
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,880
that that's that

2667
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:56,399
and you'll likely never see them again

2668
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,760
because the person's not going to remake

2669
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:59,839
them

2670
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,600
and honestly the person the [ __ ] the

2671
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,800
person isn't even usually growing them

2672
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,960
out anymore

2673
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,600
yeah

2674
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,960
you know so i i will say just just to

2675
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:11,120
finish the story

2676
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,800
i will give skunk tech some major props

2677
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:14,639
he didn't even have to tell me that he

2678
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,639
had those he didn't have to tell me that

2679
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,639
he did selections and

2680
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:20,880
made more and he certainly didn't have

2681
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:22,319
to tell natso to make sure i get them

2682
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,480
you know or make sure i know about them

2683
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:26,319
to get them so props to him for doing

2684
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:29,839
that i was i was that was pretty [ __ ]

2685
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:30,719
cool and uh there are ak-47 f2 somewhere

2686
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,319
and they're

2687
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:35,198
based on the cherry stuff so that's cool

2688
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:36,719
too what's sad about it is is that in

2689
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:39,919
1999

2690
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:42,319
um they changed the laws in holland in

2691
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,920
amsterdam and um i should say the

2692
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:45,198
netherlands really because only two

2693
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,359
provinces

2694
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:49,439
uh are

2695
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:51,679
our holland but in the netherlands they

2696
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:53,198
changed the seed laws where before seed

2697
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,679
making was legal

2698
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:58,799
and they changed it to being illegal and

2699
01:30:55,679 --> 01:31:00,800
most of the big producers in in the

2700
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,760
netherlands got busted within a year or

2701
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,679
two of that change yeah um and a lot of

2702
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:08,079
seed strains and a lot of lines that

2703
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:10,800
were available throughout the 90s

2704
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:13,439
then changed because parents were lost

2705
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,360
yes being dutch

2706
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:17,279
and i'm not trying to be

2707
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:18,880
racist is the wrong word or whatever but

2708
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:20,800
just culturally

2709
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,679
the dutch are businessmen and they won't

2710
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,639
admit that they lost anything ever

2711
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,719
yeah

2712
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:28,079
so if you ask ben or alan drunkers

2713
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:29,520
they'll tell you they have all the same

2714
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:30,639
breeding parents that they've had since

2715
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,120
the 90s

2716
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:34,960
yeah but we know that's not the case and

2717
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:37,359
it apparently simon admitted that he

2718
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:41,119
lost a couple of breeding parents

2719
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:43,519
in in his raid and kali mist and ak-47

2720
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:45,039
were not the same after

2721
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,040
yeah

2722
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:48,800
we should also it should also be said

2723
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:50,238
and this is super [ __ ] annoying for

2724
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,679
me right

2725
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,638
but that

2726
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,520
neville

2727
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:55,679
and

2728
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,560
s super sativa seed club kind of came

2729
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,440
first

2730
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,199
right

2731
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:00,638
so they just told you where they were

2732
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:02,879
what they were doing

2733
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:05,279
yeah they didn't have competition right

2734
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,800
so neville was like oh i got this nl

2735
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,479
from this person and i got this from

2736
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,719
this this and i crossed them and i

2737
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:13,839
called it nl by this

2738
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:16,319
yeah right and and he gave you a whole

2739
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,679
bunch of information on lineage

2740
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:19,279
yeah we can go through we've done it

2741
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,520
before but you can go through and most

2742
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:23,119
of where neville got his stuff we know

2743
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,600
the name of the person that gave it to

2744
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:28,079
him we know where he got it we know if

2745
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,360
he got it as a seed line or if he got it

2746
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:32,158
as a cutting

2747
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:34,079
right we know all that [ __ ]

2748
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,319
i liked simon and simon was really nice

2749
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:39,119
to me right but

2750
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:41,119
i don't [ __ ] know it's an ak-47

2751
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:43,679
yeah i don't know exactly what's in

2752
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:46,158

01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:48,800
30 years what the lineage on that stuff

2754
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:52,559

god only knows what's in what they all

2761
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:09,039
started hiding it

2762
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,679
yeah they they hid where they got it

2763
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:12,560
from who they got it from what the mix

2764
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,639
was in

2765
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:18,320
right and so it started this massive

2766
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:21,359
guessing game of i love ak-47

2767
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:23,119
yeah i have no idea what's in it

2768
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:25,759
i would love for simon to one day be

2769
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:28,000
like i'm old and i'm just down to to say

2770
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,760
it you know what i one thing i will say

2771
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,840
that's also interesting is from that old

2772
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,760
pack of seeds and i believe they were

2773
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,199
sold and simon said according to the

2774
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,880
number on it they were sold in 2000

2775
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:39,198
which meant they could have been made in

2776
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,840
98.99

2777
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:44,079
what was interesting was that the cherry

2778
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:46,880
pheno was supposedly popping up what do

2779
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:49,760
you say one in 500 or 1000 something

2780
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:52,480
a lot it took a lot to find it

2781
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:55,440
in the three seeds that popped

2782
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:57,599
out of ten from this old pack

2783
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:59,439
two were cherry

2784
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,600
so i wonder if there's some sort of like

2785
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:03,198
viking in it um which was a very cherry

2786
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,600
line floating around amsterdam at the

2787
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:07,198
time that a lot of people are using um

2788
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,960
but that that's the first thing that

2789
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:10,799
that makes me think that and i think

2790
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,920
that's pretty interesting it could

2791
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,760
you know

2792
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,760
said that that uh something that i

2793
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,840
didn't know that it wasn't lost in the

2794
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,000
bus that simon's ex-wife killed them

2795
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:22,400
killed a couple plants out of spite

2796
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,479
oh wait it was it was it's common

2797
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:26,079
knowledge that he lost him and i mean i

2798
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:29,119
always heard that he lost him

2799
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:30,960
yeah um but you know i assumed it was in

2800
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:32,800
the bust and he admitted that he lost

2801
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,880
one parent but he never admitted that he

2802
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,800
lost more than that yeah but he would

2803
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,600
just never give up the mix

2804
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,039
yeah

2805
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,560
he just never

2806
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:43,118
that that's another thing that also

2807
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:45,199
really confused me is that

2808
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:47,679
i don't understand why

2809
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:49,198
they would i granted a lot of them were

2810
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,880
trying to steal each other's clones and

2811
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:52,158
steal each other's seeds or whatever but

2812
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,560
if they were breeders they would know

2813
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:56,559
that how expressions in cannabis work

2814
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,239
you know so they probably like i would

2815
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,480
think that they wouldn't be focused too

2816
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:02,799
much on well we can't tell them the name

2817
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:04,158
or the the the line that this came from

2818
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,719
because they'll get the same thing and i

2819
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:09,039
mean well no one knows you're aware

2820
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:10,239
uh neville's opinion was they stole most

2821
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:11,600
of it from him and didn't want to give

2822
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:12,959
him [ __ ] credit

2823
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,880
yeah i know yeah he thought everything

2824
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,399
was his though no matter what i know i'm

2825
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,279
not saying it is i'm not saying it's

2826
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:19,118
true

2827
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:23,279
yeah but for whatever reason

2828
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:26,238
um you know like yeah what's in chronic

2829
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:27,359
what's what's what's kali missed

2830
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:30,559
what's

2831
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:32,158
what's ak47 what are the parents

2832
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,679
yeah where do you get the parents who

2833
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:34,479
gave them the parents

2834
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:35,440
yeah

2835
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:38,319
you know

2836
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:39,439
um all that right you just don't know

2837
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:40,840
yeah you know they've never come out and

2838
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:44,158
saying those things came out in the mid

2839
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,920
90s yeah so we're talking 25 years plus

2840
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:46,799
of him being secretive

2841
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,800
yeah

2842
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,079
you know and yeah neville had an ego and

2843
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,600
he thought the whole [ __ ] scene was

2844
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:53,760
based on his [ __ ]

2845
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,679
yeah and some of it was but some of it

2846
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,280
was his ego you know i still think he

2847
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,679
renamed afghani one

2848
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:00,719
i mean i know you do yeah i'm always i'm

2849
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:02,719
always going to push that theory and

2850
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,158
it's based on nothing but i'm still

2851
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:06,158
going to push it just because i can i

2852
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:08,638
mean one of the things that i learned

2853
01:36:06,158 --> 01:36:10,158
about uh

2854
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:11,359
someone just asked what do i believe in

2855
01:36:10,158 --> 01:36:13,679
cali mist

2856
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:14,960
um i was told by some guys in amsterdam

2857
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,800
that um

2858
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,960
you know that the mother plant was this

2859
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,560
thing called the mango

2860
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:22,158
and it was made by this guy that i don't

2861
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,400
want to name his name or whatever but it

2862
01:36:22,158 --> 01:36:26,559
was he was the guy that came up with it

2863
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:29,439
and that was at least half of it

2864
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,400
um and i i see people uh

2865
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:32,079
uh

2866
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:34,238
you know there's people want to talk

2867
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:36,079
about whatever but i mean the thing is

2868
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:37,279
is that when i went over there and when

2869
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:39,679
i started going over there in the mid

2870
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:41,279
90s there was already a bunch of dudes

2871
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:44,000
that were middle-aged that all had beef

2872
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:45,920
with one another yeah and obviously

2873
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,520
neville and sam had a bunch of beef with

2874
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,279
one another and they sniped at each

2875
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,520
other for years

2876
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,039
um and so there's an aspect there's an

2877
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,320
aspect too where it's like sometimes

2878
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:55,679
people just didn't want to give other

2879
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:57,439
people credit

2880
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:58,639
yeah they didn't want it to come from

2881
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:00,638
them

2882
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,239
yeah you know they didn't want it to be

2883
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,840
that way they didn't want it they didn't

2884
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:04,959
want to be like oh well i got that from

2885
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,520
homie

2886
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,679
yeah because homie was a dick to them

2887
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:11,760
in their mind you know and then they had

2888
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:13,600
beef and so then there was politics you

2889
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,520
can look at the politics of 90s

2890
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,079
amsterdam and you can fast forward 30

2891
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,960
years and it goes on today in california

2892
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:20,479
yeah

2893
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,880
it's very common

2894
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:25,359
so this is this is one of the

2895
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,118
old pictures of afghani one that has a

2896
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:29,439
lot of similar traits to what you will

2897
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:31,839
see in in things like super skunk or

2898
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:33,839
even chem 91 and that's one of the the

2899
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:35,679
things that originally put me to that

2900
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,600
and seeing and the la athey cut that we

2901
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:40,399
had that was a afghani number one

2902
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:42,560
selection homie just said uh collie mist

2903
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,799
was originally called western winds

2904
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,080
western winds was one of my favorite

2905
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,279
all-time

2906
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:49,840
uh

2907
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:51,039
cannabis names cambodian cambodian

2908
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,279
that's what they said but i don't

2909
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:55,279
[ __ ] know it's supposedly when they

2910
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:56,960
were at cerebral together

2911
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:59,679
it was the same thing

2912
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,600
and they broke off tony called his

2913
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:04,319
version western winds

2914
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,920
and simon called his collie missed but

2915
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:07,759
they were the same thing

2916
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,600
yeah they were the or they i mean maybe

2917
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,600
they maybe they made different breeding

2918
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,400
selections or choices but they were the

2919
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:15,119
same

2920
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:17,759
the same origin for the most part i will

2921
01:38:15,118 --> 01:38:19,359
say tony tony has been ridiculously

2922
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,119
transparent and open with me when it

2923
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:22,079
comes to asking any questions he's the

2924
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:24,079
only

2925
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,960
dutch dude who who had a seed bank from

2926
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:28,238
back then that never like flinches when

2927
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:30,880
i ask him something he's always been

2928
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:32,079
super open even if it's not like even if

2929
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,000
he doesn't know the answer he'll tell

2930
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:36,079
you well i don't really know this came i

2931
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,920
bought it in bulk from xyz and that's

2932
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:39,679
what it is and that's all we know he's

2933
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:41,840
been really [ __ ] cool about it so i

2934
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:44,000
got to give props to him for that

2935
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,000
you know i mean maybe maybe he would say

2936
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,760
what it was but maybe if it came from

2937
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,359
simon or he had b for some guy he didn't

2938
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,960
like he wouldn't say it

2939
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:52,238
yeah because that goes on today like

2940
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,840
people don't want to give other people

2941
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:55,279
credit if they don't like the person you

2942
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,079
know or they feel like they got jacked

2943
01:38:55,279 --> 01:38:58,559
on a

2944
01:38:56,079 --> 01:39:01,039
i mean even like somebody like sam like

2945
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,960
if it wasn't for mel frank uh i don't

2946
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,279
you know talking about it years later

2947
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,679
you wouldn't know that afghani won and

2948
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:09,840
durbin poison came through mel frank

2949
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,079
yeah and he gave him to sam

2950
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,119
yeah you know sam showed up in amsterdam

2951
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:15,519
with him

2952
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:18,079
you know yeah um

2953
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:20,320
and uh you know and then you know tony

2954
01:39:18,079 --> 01:39:21,519
tony has you know and then once a line

2955
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:23,118
splits

2956
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,400
maybe different breeders make different

2957
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:26,559
selections

2958
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:28,879
yeah they lean it towards one direction

2959
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:31,280
or another you know they lose with adam

2960
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,880
done and and the bubble gum and like the

2961
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:35,279
different ways simon worked bubble gum

2962
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,440
supposedly and all that yeah i mean i

2963
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:39,759
know that i know i you know i didn't i

2964
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:41,759
didn't know until tonight that that uh

2965
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,800
simon's ex or whatever killed killed the

2966
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,119
cut but

2967
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:47,039
simon's kali missed in the 90s was much

2968
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:50,238
more sativa leaning

2969
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:52,079
and then around 99 2000 it got shorter

2970
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:55,359
and thicker and more

2971
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:57,439
more indica more afghan and it lost some

2972
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:59,679
of the ethereal qualities that i liked a

2973
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:01,279
bunch about it you know that's one that

2974
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:03,679
i'd really like to reproduce and we have

2975
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:06,238
the old seeds to do it but i just it's

2976
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:08,158
one of those ones that like i'd spend

2977
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:10,238
money and time reproducing it and they

2978
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:11,439
would just sit there you know and nobody

2979
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:13,118
grew up because kelly missed really

2980
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:15,118
isn't one that people talked about at

2981
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:18,000
you know the average grower still in the

2982
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:20,479
u.s it's phenomenal there's phenos in

2983
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,479
western winds and you can look

2984
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:25,198
in western winds and cauli mist

2985
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:27,678
especially in like some mid to late 90s

2986
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:29,519
high times cannabis cups like the glossy

2987
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:30,800
pictures they would have and those and

2988
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,119
those things

2989
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:36,719
um and uh

2990
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:38,880
you know and um you know so they uh

2991
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,079
they're those are really nice you know

2992
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,679
yeah

2993
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:42,800
and um

2994
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,480
you know

2995
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,079
you know then he comes out and says it's

2996
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:48,158
kind of true i don't mean that like sam

2997
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:49,600
took a bunch of credit for it i just

2998
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:52,158
mean that it was like in the list of

2999
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:54,719
stuff that that mel that you know that

3000
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:56,960
he brought to amsterdam yeah and he

3001
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:58,480
didn't obviously say well i got these

3002
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,920
two things from these guys and i got

3003
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:01,599
these from these guys and here's the

3004
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:03,520
three hayes brothers names that i got

3005
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,520
these seats like you know it sketchy

3006
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:07,040
back then yes you still can't get that

3007
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,639
[ __ ] out of him

3008
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:10,000
you still can't get that out of him all

3009
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:12,319
right he'll tell me is that i'm wrong

3010
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,560
about the a story tell me what

3011
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:16,399
one day you know one day

3012
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,400
i mean it's uh one thing about weed is

3013
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:20,000
that people are opinionated

3014
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:22,399
yes and it takes a certain kind of

3015
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,079
person to take the risks that we all we

3016
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:27,439
all take and the various things that go

3017
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:29,118
on and you know we get beef you know and

3018
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:31,759
all that stuff and so

3019
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:34,158
um but it's it's also true that a lot of

3020
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,320
weed is a flash in the pan

3021
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:38,238
so it might be around for two or three

3022
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:39,599
or four years five years and then all of

3023
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:41,359
a sudden it's gone or it's not there in

3024
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:43,280
the same it's not there in the same in

3025
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:44,719
the same category anymore yeah it

3026
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:46,559
doesn't exist

3027
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:48,399
um and there's some there's some really

3028
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:51,280
good versions of ak that still float

3029
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:53,039
around um there was an ak in colorado

3030
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:55,439
that our good buddy working men and i

3031
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:57,840
talk about all the time that was a huge

3032
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:59,519
yielding beast of a sativa

3033
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,520
um and it smelled exactly like

3034
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:03,440
sandalwood did

3035
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,440
pure sandalwood terps

3036
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:07,519
uh matt worked with an ak version that

3037
01:42:05,439 --> 01:42:09,759
had strong cherry liqueur

3038
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,040
cherry and then lemon i had a lemon one

3039
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,119
too that was awesome and then i had the

3040
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:15,359
rc cola fino that used to go around

3041
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:18,319
skunk magazine and it smelled like flat

3042
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:20,719
cola it was it was pretty uncanny so

3043
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:23,198
that that's a pretty wide terp range in

3044
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:25,439
the ak line and and interesting and

3045
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:27,198
unique terps and a lot of them had some

3046
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:29,039
pretty god some pretty good highs with

3047
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:31,519
them too you know

3048
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:32,960
so that was a really simon didn't have a

3049
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,119
lot of strains

3050
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,560
but you know the only the only strain

3051
01:42:35,118 --> 01:42:38,399
that i think he had there was absolute

3052
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,920
bunk and i apologize if you hear this

3053
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:41,920
simon is chronic

3054
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:45,039
yeah i grew out a bunch of chronic and

3055
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:47,039
it was big and midsy and ugly

3056
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:47,840
and i never found anything worthwhile in

3057
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:50,079
it but

3058
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:52,400
his bubble gum and his ak and his white

3059
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:54,479
russian and his cali mist and all that

3060
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:56,399
that was all real nice weed i think

3061
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:57,839
white russian is totally underrated too

3062
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:59,839
from all white russian is super

3063
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,480
underrated strain and it was one of his

3064
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,319
standards for a long time and it was

3065
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:05,919
killer weed yeah there was some really

3066
01:43:04,319 --> 01:43:08,319
nice phenos of it

3067
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,480
you know i wish i knew i wish just for

3068
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:13,279
my weed nerdism or whatever i wish i

3069
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,238
knew i you know i wish i knew what ak-47

3070
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:16,479
was

3071
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:17,839
yeah like what is it

3072
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:20,000
i think if we're getting these cherry

3073
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:22,319
liqueur phenotypes is from hexabutyrate

3074
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,920
not a terp but do you think that i mean

3075
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:26,238
because we know that during that time

3076
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:29,440
there was one real strong cherry kicker

3077
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:31,359
that was being used in amsterdam um

3078
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:33,198
which was the either the holland's hope

3079
01:43:31,359 --> 01:43:34,719
which was a version of the viking or

3080
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:38,479
just using viking and they were being

3081
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:40,800
used widely at that time so i i i've

3082
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:42,319
never

3083
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,840
now that i know that it's just like and

3084
01:43:42,319 --> 01:43:46,000
how how commonly it occurs it almost

3085
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:48,239
seems like it would have to be

3086
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:51,760
chimera and crybaby both telling us that

3087
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:54,000
the cherry is is is uh from uh

3088
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:56,159
it's not a terp you know yeah that's why

3089
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,679
you know it's it's the theol's and all

3090
01:43:56,158 --> 01:44:00,158
all the various esters and all the

3091
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:02,319
various things that lead to aromas uh

3092
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:05,039
that's not an aldehyde that's not that's

3093
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:06,559
not nice uh forte necessarily there's a

3094
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:08,960
lot of learning that i could do over

3095
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,880
there that would expand my knowledge

3096
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,399
um but

3097
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,279
i would love if he told me what was in

3098
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:14,319
it

3099
01:44:13,279 --> 01:44:15,599
yeah

3100
01:44:14,319 --> 01:44:16,960
it would be real it would be really neat

3101
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,719
just to know because it's one of the

3102
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,198
all-time great strains

3103
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:22,399
yeah the super cool strain and it's neat

3104
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:24,000
that there's

3105
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:26,158
um

3106
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,679
it's neat that there is uh

3107
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,599
maybe here's something that we've talked

3108
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:31,760
about and that most people don't don't

3109
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,119
think about too much but um we're

3110
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,199
getting close to the end but i'll throw

3111
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:36,960
it out there yeah and maybe this is

3112
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:38,799
something that like a chimera could

3113
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,639
chime in on or whatever but

3114
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:43,199
um what would happen let's say you have

3115
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:45,600
two ak-47s

3116
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:47,599
or you know or two nl5 hazes or

3117
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,280
something like that from the 90s and

3118
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,280
you're pretty damn sure that they are

3119
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:52,399
what they are that they're the exact

3120
01:44:51,279 --> 01:44:54,238
same

3121
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:55,920
era they're the exact same parents

3122
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:57,839
they're just two different

3123
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,880
two different plants but from the same

3124
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:02,880
seed line

3125
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:05,840
yeah if you reverse one on to the other

3126
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,760
do you get a feminized seed line

3127
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:10,159
because it's not an outcross

3128
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,639
and it's not an s1

3129
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:14,079
so so give me the situation again

3130
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,960
let's say you took

3131
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:16,559
uh

3132
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:20,239
you know um

3133
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:23,280
uh an uh a cherry ak and crossed it to

3134
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:25,759
the colorado sandalwood ak okay

3135
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:27,679
it's not an s1

3136
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,800
and it's not an outcross

3137
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:29,679
no

3138
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,119
right

3139
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:32,960
that's when we make up words like in

3140
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:34,639
cross that's when we make them up

3141
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:37,439
because cannabis is very unique and we

3142
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:38,480
got to make up our own [ __ ] words

3143
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:40,799
you can do it with anything you could

3144
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:41,919
take any any anything that you know are

3145
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,039
sisters

3146
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,399
yeah and that came from the same parents

3147
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:47,719
right because most people that are doing

3148
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:50,479
reversals

3149
01:45:47,719 --> 01:45:53,039
99.99 percent of reversals are either s

3150
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:54,879
ones or out crosses

3151
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,118
yeah we would i mean i know me and caleb

3152
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,480
refer to them as f2rs just when we talk

3153
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:00,158
so we know what we're talking about but

3154
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:02,000
i don't think there's any standard term

3155
01:46:00,158 --> 01:46:03,599
because there's a way where it's like

3156
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,399
you know part of the reason why we do

3157
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:08,639
s1s uh one of the reasons why we do it

3158
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:10,960
in cannabis at least is because often

3159
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:13,440
there's only one pheno there's only one

3160
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,560
living cut of a certain line left and in

3161
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:16,319
order for you to look within the

3162
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:18,239
genetics of the line and see what else

3163
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:19,599
might be in there you have to cross it

3164
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:22,158
to itself

3165
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:25,280
yeah we would make normal lines out of a

3166
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:27,679
lot of these strains had we a male

3167
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:29,039
yes or had we but if you have two

3168
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:30,719
females

3169
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:32,238
and you're sure they're the exact same

3170
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:34,000
thing

3171
01:46:32,238 --> 01:46:35,118
right then you could breed two sisters

3172
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,880
together

3173
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:38,319
yeah and it wouldn't be inbreeding as

3174
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,639
much because they would have two

3175
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:43,279
different genetic profiles

3176
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:45,199
yes right it's not you're not in you're

3177
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:47,279
not inbreeding to the extent that an s1

3178
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:50,479
would be no no you're not you're not

3179
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:53,479
isolating traits still so you take you

3180
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:56,519
take a sandalwood smelling

3181
01:46:53,479 --> 01:46:58,158
ak-47 and you cross it onto the cherry

3182
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,960
ak-47

3183
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:00,479
yeah

3184
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,198
and you you know and then you have you

3185
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:05,599
have a you have a a feminized seed line

3186
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:08,319
maybe that's what uh bitter did with the

3187
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,560
p91 s ones took two different p91 s ones

3188
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:12,399
and crossed them together to create his

3189
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,800
neck but the difference is that those

3190
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:17,679
are two s ones crossed together

3191
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:21,800
yeah i'm talking about like two sisters

3192
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:21,800
from the same exact hybrid

3193
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,279
you see on the same thing

3194
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,560
that's what it was though two sisters

3195
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:28,319
from the same because if you have an s

3196
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:31,520
one if you have two sisters from an s

3197
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:31,519
one there's one parent

3198
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
and that's one has one parent right

3199
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:39,118
there's two identical parents so the

3200
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,800
genetics is essentially one parent

3201
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:43,279
but if you take two sisters from a

3202
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:44,239
regular line

3203
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:46,639
right

3204
01:47:44,238 --> 01:47:48,559
yeah then it's two parents

3205
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:49,840
you know and it's like if you like for

3206
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:51,119
instance i got multiple daughters you

3207
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,719
look at my daughters they're not two

3208
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:54,559
peas from the same pod

3209
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:55,760
yeah obviously you know they have some

3210
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:57,840
they got you know they look very

3211
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,600
different from each other yeah you know

3212
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:01,760
my wife and i's jeans popped in

3213
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:04,560
different ways in that regard

3214
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:07,039
so you're referring specifically to an

3215
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,239
f1 hybrid and then using

3216
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:10,399
two

3217
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:12,959
sisters from that f1 hybrid not from a

3218
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:14,638
reversal necessarily like let's say for

3219
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,800
instance you took

3220
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:20,239
um you know we can't get we can't

3221
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:22,400
guarantee this but let's say you took c5

3222
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:24,158
yeah and crossed it to cuban black and

3223
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:27,279
you were sure you know that you're or

3224
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:29,599
you had two phenos of nl5 haze yeah and

3225
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:31,359
you knew that the mom was nl5 and the

3226
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,520
dad was haze in both it was just two

3227
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:35,920
phenos from the same thing

3228
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:37,679
right and you cross those you reversed

3229
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,199
one on to the other

3230
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:41,520
yeah that's probably one of the most

3231
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:43,198
rare things in breeding

3232
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,840
because then you'd have a feminized line

3233
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:47,198
but it wouldn't be an

3234
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:49,119
s1 i mean the only difference between

3235
01:48:47,198 --> 01:48:51,519
that in the feminized version would be

3236
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:52,719
that the feminized version would have

3237
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,320
less

3238
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:57,359
variation

3239
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:59,039
because there wasn't an additional

3240
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:00,559
uh line

3241
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:01,920
at the

3242
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,039
what we're calling the parental level

3243
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,039
but that's all but i just mean in the

3244
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:07,519
sense that so let's say you take let's

3245
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:09,600
say you make a cherry ak s1

3246
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:12,320
yeah you're gonna only have the gene

3247
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,400
pool that's within that specific

3248
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:15,920
that specific plant

3249
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:18,719
it would be going in that direction for

3250
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:20,560
that specific but if you had if you had

3251
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:22,319
a sister of hers

3252
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:24,560
yes that was something different even

3253
01:49:22,319 --> 01:49:26,840
though they're sisters she probably has

3254
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:30,000
a different a slightly different genetic

3255
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,920
makeup so it would be a sibling cross

3256
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,079
yeah but it's almost never done because

3257
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:36,239
we almost never have to it wouldn't be

3258
01:49:34,079 --> 01:49:38,000
nearly as inbred

3259
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:39,678
yeah it wouldn't be nearly as inbred as

3260
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,319
a reverse crop and you'd probably you'd

3261
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:44,639
probably get like a a lot wider

3262
01:49:42,319 --> 01:49:45,840
expression within the seats

3263
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:48,000
you know what's interesting though what

3264
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:50,560
you're describing is almost exactly what

3265
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,599
dj did with blueberry

3266
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,480
two

3267
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:56,800
things that were were from the same

3268
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:59,359
parentage two totally opposite different

3269
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,360
expressions and constantly re-cross them

3270
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:03,198
from a small population

3271
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:04,719
each generation i mean i'm not saying

3272
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:06,319
that like in a perfect world if you had

3273
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:08,480
hundreds of seeds that's the direction

3274
01:50:06,319 --> 01:50:10,960
that you you should go in oh no no but

3275
01:50:08,479 --> 01:50:12,319
i'm just saying that is a method sure

3276
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,800
there's there's an aspect where it's

3277
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:17,279
like if all you have in the line is one

3278
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:20,480
living living example

3279
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:23,198
then you all you can do is self it

3280
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:24,959
yeah but if you got two

3281
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:26,079
then you could widen the gene pool just

3282
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,480
slightly

3283
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:31,359
yeah and have and have a group of seeds

3284
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:33,439
that had a slightly wider gene pool

3285
01:50:31,359 --> 01:50:36,399
than you could get with s1

3286
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:38,559
yeah but i think like if you keep like

3287
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:38,559
that

3288
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:44,158
i think if you do that and you keep

3289
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:45,598
doing it in successive generations what

3290
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:49,439
you get is a lot of mutants and

3291
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:51,920
weirdness without necessarily the the

3292
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:54,719
narrow down variation i was just

3293
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:56,480
thinking in terms of like 90s weed or

3294
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:58,158
various things where you might get lucky

3295
01:50:56,479 --> 01:51:00,319
and you might have one or you might have

3296
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:01,598
two or even three phenos that might

3297
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:02,479
exist

3298
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:04,400
yeah

3299
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:06,638
you see

3300
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:08,079
yeah like where it wouldn't be that that

3301
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:09,039
would probably be

3302
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:10,399
i don't know

3303
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:12,560
you know it's just something that's not

3304
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:14,559
often done but if there's two females

3305
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:16,080
from the same line you might be able to

3306
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:19,039
figure it out

3307
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:20,238
but it's almost never done

3308
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:23,118
think of somebody that you think of

3309
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:25,198
somebody that has that often

3310
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:28,238
it's like it's almost like back crossing

3311
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,919
it's not off you don't see back

3312
01:51:28,238 --> 01:51:31,118
you don't see back crosses to males

3313
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,960
often done

3314
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:35,519
but it's an interesting thing you know

3315
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:38,079
what i mean it has its place

3316
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:39,920
yeah i just in terms of i mean in terms

3317
01:51:38,079 --> 01:51:41,279
of most genetic preservation we're like

3318
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:44,319
super lucky

3319
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:46,079
if one pheno of an old line survives

3320
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:48,079
oh yeah for sure

3321
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:50,479
you know but in the case of in the case

3322
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:52,000
of nl5 by hay c

3323
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:53,439
there's probably three or four or five

3324
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,679
that survived

3325
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:57,198
yeah a lot more than that i think if we

3326
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,319
really knew for sure i think there'd be

3327
01:51:57,198 --> 01:51:59,759
a lot more

3328
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:01,679
you know and so there's potential where

3329
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:03,440
you could you could you know you could i

3330
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:05,520
i don't know i mean it's just

3331
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:07,198
interesting in that in that regard right

3332
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,239
yeah projects the monster those are not

3333
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:11,039
siblings

3334
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:12,718
um let's see we don't know for sure

3335
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:13,760
they're not [ __ ] siblings i don't

3336
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:16,079
think so

3337
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:18,400
yeah but we once the

3338
01:52:16,079 --> 01:52:19,920
that we hoped that that philos and some

3339
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:22,000
other and some other genetic groups

3340
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:25,118
would be able to prove these things

3341
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,359
and it has not happened

3342
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:28,880
yeah no philos got everybody's money

3343
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:30,559
because they promised they would be able

3344
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:32,079
to show what was a grandparent what was

3345
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,840
a child what was a hut what was a

3346
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:36,158
daughter what was a mother

3347
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,679
and not not the case

3348
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:40,799
and we're still going to do a full

3349
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:42,158
episode on that eventually

3350
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,920
on why

3351
01:52:42,158 --> 01:52:45,598
why we were able to prove that it was a

3352
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:47,920
broken system

3353
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:49,920
uh effectively prove it

3354
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,118
but um yeah

3355
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,118
you're gonna give it a little bit of

3356
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:55,839
time so people don't get to butt hurt

3357
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:57,598
and sue and all that [ __ ]

3358
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:59,679
you know but it's it's just one of those

3359
01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:01,840
things where uh

3360
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:04,000
uh do we know whether males or females

3361
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:05,679
are responsible specific

3362
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,039
there's no there's no you know there's a

3363
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:11,199
lot of there's no way it works

3364
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:13,840
because because cannabis for a long time

3365
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:13,839
has been

3366
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:19,678
well i just i was just gonna say that um

3367
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,158
cannabis for a long time has been

3368
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,279
deprived of science or the science

3369
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:26,559
aspect

3370
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:28,479
of uh of breeding uh most of it is

3371
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:30,800
observational by people

3372
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:32,559
still to this day there are some people

3373
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:34,880
that um

3374
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:37,199
uh there are some people that are doing

3375
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,199
that are doing work uh that are using a

3376
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:41,039
lot more uh scientific methods and

3377
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:43,039
things like that but

3378
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:44,960
um it's rare still

3379
01:53:43,039 --> 01:53:46,639
yeah most cannabis breeding is

3380
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,960
observational

3381
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,239
um and so it's hard to know males and

3382
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,399
females

3383
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:54,638
um you know we just don't have we just

3384
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:56,079
we just word did not up until 10 15

3385
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:58,159
years ago or something like that we were

3386
01:53:56,079 --> 01:54:00,719
mostly denied labs

3387
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:03,279
yeah we were mostly denied access

3388
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:06,800
um to what you know normal breeders

3389
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:06,800
would be able to use all the time

3390
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:11,359
yeah so i want to do a um giveaway

3391
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:13,279
before we're done since we're almost at

3392
01:54:11,359 --> 01:54:15,279
two hours

3393
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:18,079
and i actually thought of something to

3394
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:20,238
do so you didn't have to um

3395
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:23,118
so like we used to do back in the back

3396
01:54:20,238 --> 01:54:24,479
in i don't know a year or two ago

3397
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:25,598
i picked out

3398
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:28,319
um

3399
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:31,119
a phrase there's going to be a blank

3400
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:32,158
spot in this phrase and whoever comes up

3401
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:33,679
with

3402
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:37,198
who we all agree

3403
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:39,920
is the funniest answer gets the bomb

3404
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:41,359
threat bubba hawaiian lights hybrid um

3405
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:43,840
it's one of the more expensive ones so i

3406
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:46,158
wanted to get it out there so people can

3407
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:50,679
yeah anyways so

3408
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:50,679
we have a few different ones let me see

3409
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:55,279
okay here we go here it is you guys if

3410
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:57,520
you want to participate you're going to

3411
01:54:55,279 --> 01:55:00,639
have to fill in the blank

3412
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:02,960
rub-a-dub-dub blank in the tub who has

3413
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:07,118
the best answer rub-a-dub-dub your

3414
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:08,399
answer in a tub who has the best answer

3415
01:55:07,118 --> 01:55:10,000
oh man

3416
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:11,039
i know this one should be nice and

3417
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,639
creative

3418
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:15,840
rub a dub dub

3419
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:15,840
blank in a tub

3420
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:21,439
rub a dub dub dank in a tub

3421
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:25,519
12 vc in a tub

3422
01:55:21,439 --> 01:55:25,519
these nuts is always a great response

3423
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:30,479
let's yeah

3424
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:32,399
fiddling

3425
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:34,399
tug in a tub

3426
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:37,198
sub in a tub oh that's a good one

3427
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:38,559
because that didn't that did exist

3428
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:40,238
it did exist

3429
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,159
until it's gross

3430
01:55:40,238 --> 01:55:43,759
yeah i might have to pin this one so we

3431
01:55:42,158 --> 01:55:45,519
remember who did sub in the tub to see

3432
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:48,079
if someone could beat him

3433
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:50,080
let's see pin okay let's see what we got

3434
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:52,559
those pictures of sub in the tub were
