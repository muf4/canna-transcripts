perspective on everything that went down

00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,739
and his experiences from his angle so

32
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,899
mad Jack didn't help me lean on this

33
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,000
because he he knows the the important

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,618
questions and and Adam I kind of just

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,478
want to sit back maybe ask a few things

36
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,799
here and there but let you two have a

37
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,200
conversation about those years because

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,140
that's what people really want to hear

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,200
so let's take it away Mad Jack

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,359
well the other day I was speaking with

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,560
Matthew and trying to give him some

42
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,118
history of how I met you

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,978
and

44
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:01,140
and it started pretty far back with my

45
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:04,140
friendship with

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,560
um Doug and then

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,560

59
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,119
to know later

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,180
and Amanda had already moved to Phoenix

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,300
I had known her in Birmingham and

62
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,819
through Martin they were an item anyway

63
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,800
we were both studying film at Manchester

64
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,919
University and

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,000
um Amanda sent us some of the original

66
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,979
Mad Jag I think 78 and

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,080
um we smoked we saw these tiny little

68
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,359
joints you know and back then Matthew

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,180
you probably uh you know or maybe you're

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,580
too young

71
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,120
we would make spliffs out of um you know

72
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,540
five skin joints it was like a a quite a

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,239
operation to add tobacco in and stuff

74
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,639
exactly lots of tobacco you know you had

75
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,800
to be able to smoke you needed some

76
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,458
content in there with uh with the leaf

77
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,340
matter right well hash no no what I was

78
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,800
going to say was it was harsh mostly and

79
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,039
then we had this little present from

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,659
Arizona from Amanda in a little vacuum

81
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,620
pack we saw these tiny little little

82
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:45,719
joints you know so the two of us like

83
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,900
Martin and I and there was another fella

84
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:51,359
there who was sharing a little house in

85
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,700
um in Manchester and we thought what the

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,340
hell is this you know and we proceeded

87
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,079
to smoke the entire thing you know yeah

88
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,739
between two of us

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,670
and you know 20 minutes later we're in

90
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,219
the catatonic stage

91
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:08,479
[Laughter]

92
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:11,479
we just had never experienced you know

93
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:14,780
as you know better than I you know is um

94
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:18,779
much more different hi to the um oh yeah

95
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:21,839
you know grass and and Jim Matt Jack

96
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:24,359
there had grown the Mad Jack you know um

97
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,839
I think that was your year before

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,180
you did it with Doug Jimbo or no it was

99
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,159
with Doug right okay so it must have

100
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,000
been that yeah yeah

101
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,939
um so one year was that was that 78 yep

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,899
yep you know Jim I think it was sooner I

103
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:44,759
I think it came sooner my recollection

104
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,099
is that because

105
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,960
oh maybe not but anyway

106
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,000
um no I think it was sooner anyway it

107
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,939
was grass as opposed to Hash that's the

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,180
point and it was and we were completely

109
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,978
ripped you know for four or five hours

110
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,259
barely able to function because we

111
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:03,539
completely overdone it you know and yeah

112
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,460
and um anyway

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,040
um so I I have some questions for you

114
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,379

115
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,819

173
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,098

and uh great clubs too and tremendous

175
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:50,519
bands ELO and Spencer Davis that became

00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,680
Transit Davis oh yeah yeah Led Zeppelin

177
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,859

and um yep lots of lots of stunning

179
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,300
bands but yeah the scar and the reggae

180
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,198
scene was tremendous and some of the the

181
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,060
Jamaican guys would take over these um

182
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,759
whole streets of you know row houses

183
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,800
yeah that you guys call them Terrace we

184
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,560
call them in England and uh one house

185
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,418
would be dedicated for the shabeens they

186
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,000
called them which is the bodies you know

187
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,620
oh wow yeah and I remember going there

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,779
the first time with three or four mates

189
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,360
we were the only white guys there you

190
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,638
know and we were tolerated I don't know

191
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,979
how welcome we were but when you went

192
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,060
when you went in you know the guy would

193
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:34,620
um hand you a a cone of um of ganja you

194
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,958
know as they call it you know that that

195
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,200
the way they grew the grass and Jamaica

196
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,598
yeah and you'd puffle you'd have one

197
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,120
each you know that's awesome you know

198
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,959
and and and they'd be playing that

199
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,860
really cool laid-back Scar and reggae

200
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:55,379
and um what a scene you know

201
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,759
and everybody ripped of course yeah I

202
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,439
would have I would have that's that's

203
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,720
what I would dream to have been around

204
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,060
for it like if I could go back in a time

205
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,160
machine would be to see that era of uh

206
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,359
England because the music the ska the

207
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,539
reggae scene and how many people

208
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,940
influenced later on yeah yeah that's

209
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,819
amazing yeah it was fun it was it was

210
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,920
great times man we were wild together or

211
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,200
in fact you know when I came to Arizona

212
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,479
Jim probably saved my life you know

213
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,580
because

214
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,120
that we would have been finished at 50

215
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,860
you know but yeah yeah

216
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,919
so

217
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,220
let's go ahead culture in England like

218
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,500
was that is it yeah

219
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,959
we seldom Saw Grass at least in the

220
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,539
scenes I was in as I say the ganja that

221
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:46,018
the Jamaicans brought in of course from

222
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:49,139
the Caribbean was the closest we saw to

223
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:52,620
any Leaf you know okay we got the

224
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:56,240
Lebanese the blonde Lebanese

225
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,278
sometimes and then the also the um

226
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,500
Afghani sometimes The Afghani was

227
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,919
streaked with white and I I don't know

228
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,200
we we used to maybe we were dreaming but

229
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,559
we think it was opium in it you know oh

230
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,240
maybe yeah I've heard about that um so I

231
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,559
was watching a video the other day and

232
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,879
there was they were showing the process

233
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:21,000
of how the hash is mixed and made in

234
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,639
Afghanistan and what they were doing was

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,559
bringing in they had the nice hash the

236
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,899
creamy beautiful stuff and they had it

237
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,579
all melted down you know really worked

238
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,519
real heavy and they were throwing in the

239
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,040
garbage on top of it garbage it's a

240
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,839
little bit of opium

241
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,639
oh a little bit of a little bit of uh

242
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,200
like the crappy hash from the air and

243
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,720
they're mixing it all in so that they

244
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,700
could sell at the higher price yeah yeah

245
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,160
they were mixing in all kinds of crap

246
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,360
just uh just to sell it for a higher

247
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,919
price and apparently they do this each

248
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,019
year and it's an old practice of mixing

249
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,599
the bad hash with the good hash

250
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,600
but yeah they also mix in supposedly

251
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,459
opium uh from what that said yeah yeah

252
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,980
yeah the streaks you know we remember

253
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,958
the white streaks and The Afghani was

254
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,720
the sought after Lebanese was okay

255
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,179
Moroccan was okay uh you know well fine

256
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,820
you know but um but the Afghani

257
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,039
everybody wanted that and it was it was

258
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,140
quite a bit more um powerful you know

259
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:19,019
and I we always thought because it was

260
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:22,699
you know really you know you didn't feel

261
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,700
much pain for foreign

262
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:29,759
but we always you know and it was an

263
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:34,319
education to if I may go on to Arizona

264
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:37,200
you know to to to meet the Jimbo and um

265
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,459
and and and yeah smoke the uh this that

266
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,680
would have been

267
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:43,078
um Gemini who worked for two years in

268
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,919
the canyon my book only Chronicles one

269
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,578
but

270
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,019
um

271
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:51,479
I remember the first meeting uh gym at

272
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,919
David Hardy's this guy that was married

273
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,159
to the English girl that's the

274
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,778
connection you know and smoking grass in

275
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,578
the morning you know I was thinking wow

276
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,679
you know because we only in England it

277
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:05,458
was you know you went out and had bad

278
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,500
pints of strong yeah yeah back and and

279
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:11,239
you were you were you know you couldn't

280
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,240
move hardly laugh or

281
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:19,379
Mischief with her but mostly it was you

282
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,719
know you just laid out right yeah but

283
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,539
but that was the introduction to grass

284
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,180
and um and how much more invigorating it

285
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:29,879
was as opposed to innovating you know um

286
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,500
yes the the the oxidization you guys

287
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,740
know better than iPhone sure you know

288
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,839
you know when that was the trouble with

289
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,180
um all sticks and seeds that came in

290
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,600
from Mexico right and Colombia which was

291
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:44,578
it it zonked you out you got high but it

292
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,139
wasn't invigorating and that's what

293
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:48,539
turned me on to

294
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,579
the Mad jagweed was this you know you

295
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:52,860
have a puff in the morning we used to go

296
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:55,679
and throw the football around and yeah

297
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,778
David Hardy had a little Park what was

298
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,838
it there you may I'm sure remember that

299
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:04,139
Jim but you know yeah buddy the reason

300
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,019
why I said 78 is that's when Doug and I

301
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:11,100
grew and yeah I only grew once with

302
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:13,620
Robert and I I didn't have I I didn't

303
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:17,159
know David Hardy yet or Amanda

304
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,539
so it was Doug and I our first year in

305
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,480
78.

306
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:23,159
well maybe I'm I'm inventing this story

307
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,019
to make it because that's what I wrote

308
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,019
about in the book but anyway

309
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,019
um

310
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,879
but I

311
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,740
am

312
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,958
I get point was that it was grass you

313
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,919
know in in those little New York needles

314
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:40,078
as opposed to the to the LA champagne

315
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,240
she used to get and we'd break off a bit

316
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,979
of hash and we'd heed it you guys know

317
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,799
all that right and then you crumble it

318
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,500
into the tobacco where this but the

319
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,979
grass that we smoked in Manchester that

320
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,639
year was the first real you know neat

321
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,980
Strong Grass it was it didn't have seeds

322
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,259
the ones no it did not exactly it was

323
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,480
sensimere yeah so that makes sense

324
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,439
though because the the even the Jamaican

325
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,259
Colombian well I don't know about

326
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,959
Jamaican probably uh Colombian Mexican a

327
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:12,419
lot of that stuff was you know uh dried

328
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,939
in the Sun so it was all just oxidized

329
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,799
to [ __ ] and and can be heavy CBN you're

330
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,540
gonna be tired it's gonna wear you out

331
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,120
so that's what most people were used to

332
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:25,139
when you got like that fresh grown not

333
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,839
oxidized not sun-dried not gold weed I'm

334
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:31,139
sure that was just so energizing yeah

335
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,320
yeah for sure and uh and and I think

336
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:37,339
that Jim was probably in at the very

337
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,660
early stages I mean I think it was um

338
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,519
Humboldt County of course is famous for

339
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:43,439
starting it probably in the mid 70s

340
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,139
right and yeah the guy the guy's

341
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,139
learning how to pull the males and um

342
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:52,019
and how to how to and under through the

343
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,720
the vital three four days after you cut

344
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:58,560
it you know how you took care of it and

345
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,180
um and uh that was um an idea again that

346
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,698
I developed which didn't actually happen

347
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:05,879
you know it's a novel what I wrote and

348
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:08,939
um and the second part is about uh going

349
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,919
down to Mexico in in to Oaxaca which is

350
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,220
the origin of the seeds you know yeah

351
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,659
and Jim if I don't throw him under the

352
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,778
bus here I think the statute of

353
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:21,059
limitations has run out but you know his

354
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,338
connections down there with uh with some

355
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:26,338
characters anyway that's that's later in

356
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:29,339
the story and and uh yeah it was uh

357
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,800
grass was was was you know opened our

358
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,440
minds in a way in every sense you know

359
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,240
the the Cincinnati green the green I

360
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,240
think we used to call it I'm not an

361
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,539
expert on these strains or anything I'm

362
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,180
seldom had very much after that my years

363
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:47,458
with the gym at my early years in

364
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:49,138
America I have occasional puppies but

365
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,698
you you were there at the at the

366
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:52,139
beginning and that's just you know what

367
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,698
I mean like that's what that's what

368
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,740
fascinates people it's not necessarily

369
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:57,479
like does this guy know everything about

370
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,399
strains does he know everything about

371
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,320
breeding it's it's the guys who were

372
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,980
there the the the guys who took the

373
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,740
risks that put their lives on the line

374
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,220
to to get us from point A to point B and

375
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,620
those are the guys that we all like

376
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,600
people of my generation really look up

377
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,698
to because like I'm I'm from a

378
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,560
generation where like when I started

379
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,539
growing real heavily it was during

380
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,198
California's prop 215. so it was already

381
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:27,179
semi-legal right but I was dealing with

382
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,979
other stuff that wasn't quite so legal

383
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,138
and trying to walk that fine line you

384
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,579
know and and I I spent countless nights

385
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,139
up wondering if my door is going to get

386
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:36,239
hit because you know the the plants were

387
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,159
too smelly you know during Harvest time

388
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,799
that the Harvest Time sweats you know

389
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,719
like so I can only imagine during an era

390
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,939
where it's just Draconian laws I mean

391
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,620
you were coming from England risking it

392
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,300
all over here and not knowing what your

393
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,879
future would hold if you got caught it's

394
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,698
just it's pretty pretty inspiring pretty

395
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,100
inspiring well you thank you I mean yeah

396
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:59,219
I mean the motive for me was of course

397
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,759
was was the adventure I loved the the

398
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,818
Southwest the dry climate compared to

399
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,338
you know obviously a damp wet colder

400
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:10,199
climate in England and uh yeah being out

401
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:13,198
in the I was already a bit of a rock

402
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,860
climber and um and um Back Country kind

403
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,459
of guy and um I just loved it and um and

404
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,639
um

405
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,980
I uh you know fell in love with this man

406
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,140
here now Kitty we spent a lot of time in

407
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,419
the tent together

408
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:30,140
I bet I'm sorry I'm the feeble English

409
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,140
jokes no no

410
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,240
he you know what impressed me was how

411
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,339
organized Jimbo was you know I thought I

412
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,558
was coming into these kind of uh I would

413
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,839
no you know before I committed obviously

414
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,538
we and before he committed to me we

415
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:49,019
didn't know one another in um you know

416
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:50,819
the the winter of 79 we met I think down

417
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:53,279
in Phoenix wasn't it Jim

418
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,500
uh at David's house I think so at

419
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,558
David's or or

420
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,599
was Doug living down there then no no I

421
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,359
don't think so

422
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,298
it must have been that David right but

423
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:10,379
but but I started to talk to Jim and um

424
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:12,119
and and and Doug for reasons that uh who

425
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,539
were left alone he wasn't able to work

426
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,798
that year yeah and and so Jim started to

427
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:19,500
talk to me about it and I thought well

428
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,839
what am I getting into you know just

429
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,519
uh that's kind of you know a bunch of

430
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,099
spaced out hippies and it's going to be

431
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,740
dangerous but Jim was so organized he's

432
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:30,899
he's kind of a neat freak yeah yeah he's

433
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,038
very organized much neater than me and

434
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,400
uh I know that I uh you know we um we

435
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,720
were like the these two

436
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,720
Paul's apart you know here's me coming

437
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:47,880
from London from working in um the BBC

438
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,700
and uh drinking kind of layabout you

439
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,940
know yeah yeah and there's this um guy

440
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,279
that was into Carlos Castaneda and um

441
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,100
much more spiritual and much more

442
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,019
healthy as I say he probably saved me

443
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,298
from an early death you know I've gone

444
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:06,058
back to London I would have carried on

445
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:10,019
that you know very unhealthy life but

446
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:12,298
but Jim was so organized and um and once

447
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,440
I saw all that and how together he was

448
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:15,779
you know

449
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,120
that that's what that's what persuaded

450
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,579
me you know if I'd run into this guy who

451
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,038
was utterly stoned all the while not to

452
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,599
say that we're here

453
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:26,220
taking all sorts of things and I don't

454
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,038
know how much he wants me to tell you

455
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,880
about that he had this wonderful little

456
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:35,579
house in Cottonwood Arizona cat claw on

457
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,980
the street was called cat claw and it

458
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,659
was like this little Haven of um of

459
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,538
safety you know because obviously our

460
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,900
crop was um in the mountains you know in

461
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:48,419
the canyon and um and and as soon as I

462
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,160
went into his house and saw how neat and

463
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,679
tidy he kept everything and everything

464
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,538
stashed away he's he's Infamous in our

465
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,620
circles for his little bottles in fact

466
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:57,619
here I got one right here

467
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,299
well this this may not be typical but

468
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,220
this is something he gave me but he's

469
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:08,400
he's Infamous at having all these little

470
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:13,200
tiny bottles with the various uh you

471
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,780
know uh rugs mostly there you go yeah

472
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,500
yeah yeah he's he's always leaving these

473
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:18,500
little things out

474
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,340
when you read the book and um when

475
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:29,720
Netflix makes the film out of it I'm I'm

476
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:29,720
Dreaming one hitter oh nice brand new

477
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,099
recently and saw this and you open it up

478
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:38,179
and put your buds inside and then you

479
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,178
hold a match and

480
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,480
didn't you have a a pipe that we could

481
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,700
toke in bars I remember we went to

482
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,579

483
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,460

anything we were just in the bars and

487
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:06,000
um I and Jim I remember we went into

488
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:08,099
that we we drove his car across I think

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,619
there were five or six of us we drove

490
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:13,918

491
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:15,239
great place it was back then and um and

492
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,059
and we went over the mountains to

493
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,819
Prescott it's a big windy you know

494
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:23,220
through there

495
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:24,960
yeah and then we went into um a country

496
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,140
in western bar to start the afternoon

497
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,360
you know to get a drink yeah Jim Jim had

498
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,580

501
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,120
back and uh we'll come in the two doors

502
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,220
you know so I thought what the hell is

503
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,158
this you know and I lit the uh but I let

504
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:48,319
it you know um and and I threw it down

505
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,320
by the door and opened the door

506
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,860
[Laughter]

507
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,538
that was your entrance yeah and then

508
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:56,699
just as they came in one side and all

509
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:58,140
the Cowboys you know with their hats and

510
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,538
the girl you know it was a real country

511
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:04,860
in western bar yeah and then on the

512
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:06,599
other side uh Jim dropped his and uh so

513
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:09,178
so all the heads turned to us you know

514
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:12,658
because the place was pretty packed I

515
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:14,460
mean Rodeo July 4th and then boom the

516
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,260
crackers off the other side and then

517
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,620
come the other two or three guys with

518
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:21,720
with Jimbo and um I wouldn't say we took

519
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,639
over the bar but you know that's a way

520
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,880
to make it later entrance yeah I can

521
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,880
appreciate that we were walking down the

522
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,740
street on the way there and we passed it

523
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,559
you know people have to park their

524
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,538
vehicles for 10 15 blocks in all

525
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,240
directions and they'll come in two days

526
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:40,919
early and park them and sleep in the

527
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,259
back of them because you can't there's

528
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,659
no place to park 10 20 000 people show

529
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,519
up so we're walking down the street from

530
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:51,780
where we park and there was a pickup

531
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:54,359
truck with cases of beer just piled

532
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:57,298
on each other in the back and we looked

533
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,599
around and we grabbed we each I don't

534
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:02,519
know I think we grabbed like two cases

535
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,918
and we just took off down the street and

536
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:08,339
when we got to Main Street back there um

537
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:11,340
on Whiskey Row which it was legal then

538
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:14,279
to walk with alcohol in the open outside

539
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:16,798
on Whiskey Road on this two block

540
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:20,339
section we just started handing beers to

541
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:23,460
people and Six Packs to people and we

542
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:25,678
had so much it was just funny I I hope

543
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,659
whoever saw that who whoever's truck

544
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,559
that is it would be really cool if they

545
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:33,440
were watching this

546
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:36,538
yeah sent me a bill

547
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,058
right no it was the wildest couple of

548
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:41,038
years of my life and that's the I'm not

549
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:44,759
saying something you know and these two

550
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:47,339
years I spent with my partner here you

551
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:50,158
know but yeah but uh that's what

552
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:52,918
persuaded me you know the grass and the

553
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,380
adventure of it for sure obviously the

554
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,559
hope to make some money you know which

555
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,720
we certainly did

556
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:03,658
you know we had two years the first year

557
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,538
we um we found a wonderful little garden

558
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,760
not so little maybe and we worked like

559
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:11,519
hell to prepare that just the two of us

560
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,819
that year and we dug a lot of holes

561
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,200
remember those holes Jim that we dug and

562
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:18,480
um and then this

563
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,819
um and then we pulled it off and it was

564
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,000
it was great you know I mean it was yeah

565
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:27,779
the risk was huge it was a Mormon County

566
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,179
Christ it was uh yeah yeah we would have

567
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,700
been in serious trouble if we'd been

568
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:35,340
napped you know yeah I always felt in

569
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,679
the canyon that you know I didn't say

570
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:39,058
that we were safe because you know there

571
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,280
was methods you know they had the

572
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:45,418
infrared cameras I believe in those days

573
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,759
you know and um and also of course even

574
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,980
though we wound the the you know the

575
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,119
garden through the we had manzania

576
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,279
Manzanita right Jim on one side

577
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,678
in in pine trees and pine trees and it

578
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,259
was up from the creek you know you could

579
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,120
walk by uh one of the things I always

580
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:04,980
remember of course in the autumn in the

581
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,879
in the fall when it was due was the

582
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,058
smell

583
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,659
you could absolutely smell the weed from

584
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:14,759
the creek you know so yeah so a guy

585
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,980
walking through here if anybody did I

586
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,379
mean and Jim says that in four years I

587
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,900
don't think we saw more than one one or

588
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,600
two one footstep and that was um some

589
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,120
hippie hiker went through there but very

590
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:30,240
it wasn't that it was so you know 30

591
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:33,418
miles from a road or anything but to get

592
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,120
into it you had to descend via an

593
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,720
enormously exhausting

594
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,879
um rock for

595
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,220
basalt it is

596
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,919
and and if you we tried we looked for

597
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,700
many other ways but they were all not

598
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,820
only

599
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,580
um virtually impossible and exhausting

600
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:55,678
but dangerous too because there'll be

601
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:58,678
Cliffs and then there'd be a scree slope

602
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,980
right and then another cliff and um it

603
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,900
had to wind your way through and the and

604
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,240
the the soil was loose you know there

605
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,100
were times I remember when we explored I

606
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,659
don't know if you remember Jim but you

607
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:12,000
know there was a chance you could have

608
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:16,380
slipped and gone over the edge you know

609
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,940
not to mention I I got spared by

610
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,520
um you know one of those Dreadful

611
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,980
agave's that have like a needle on the

612
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:27,259
end yeah my leg was swollen for uh

613
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,079
because they're slightly poisonous right

614
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:33,720
yeah

615
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:36,899
Agave Paras pares I remember was one the

616
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,298
Paris Paris anyway there were anyway

617
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,820
that was the only way we got we dropped

618
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:44,579
in was um through you know there was no

619
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:46,619
path it was just working your way down

620
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:48,178
these Bowlers and and when the people

621
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:49,979
came in to help us

622
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:52,380
you know with the Harvest at the end of

623
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,440
the year you know they were exhausted

624
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,360
okay utterly unused to it we were in

625
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,980
good shape and even so there wasn't a

626
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,859
trail going down you actually had to

627
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,620
descend Boulders and [ __ ] exactly that's

628
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:07,099
wild that is

629
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:09,899
lots of branches and bushes right

630
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:12,538
crashing through them and we very

631
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,580
carefully clipped just a few that were

632
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:16,440
in critical spots where you might have

633
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:18,480
to jump from one Boulder down three feet

634
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,820
to a big boulder and you know you

635
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,679
couldn't be jumping into Oblivion

636
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:24,058
without seeing it so we cut a branch so

637
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,140
you could at least see where you're

638
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:28,079
gonna land

639
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,538
right once I was stepping down with a 30

640
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,099
40 pound pack and I already took the

641
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:33,839
motion to move and there was a

642
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:35,639
rattlesnake coiled up right where I was

643
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,220
going to step and I had to throw myself

644
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,080
sideways into the bushes and my pack

645
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,319
just pulled me down and protected me it

646
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,298
banged against the next Boulder and

647
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,579
um you know we had some interesting

648
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:50,339
little experiences none of us ever got

649
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:53,038
got bit or anything those scorpion bites

650
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:55,259
we did have a friend who came down who

651
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:59,819
sprained his ankle really bad Mike if

652
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:02,879
you remember that I sure do and we uh

653
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:04,500
I know you do because you were tuning a

654
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,840
motorcycle with him and you had him get

655
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,839
on the motorcycle your motorcycle in

656
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,220
Phoenix and he was on it holding the

657
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,959
throttle and revving it and you were

658
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,900
doing something and he said okay now do

659
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,419
this and he popped the clutch and I told

660
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,700
him not to yeah yeah he said the

661
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,380
motorcycle shot up into the air and he

662
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,259
was flying behind it with his body

663
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,760
horizontal to the ground and then he let

664
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,519
go of the bike and it just kept going

665
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:33,058
and then he he did a full body slam boom

666
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:36,538
down onto the ground on the road he was

667
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:39,058
accident prone that guy yeah

668
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:42,119
oh well yeah Mike's a good guy he's

669
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:43,980
still alive he lives in North Phoenix

670
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,379
um last year

671
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,900
he doesn't remember things well so he

672
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,580
can't drive anymore

673
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,100
I'll be going to see him in the next few

674
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,678
weeks along with Robert

675
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:57,719
yep

676
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,659
we never got bitten no the even the

677
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,460
Scorpions I was convinced there was a

678
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:06,240
snake in my sleeping bag I was probably

679
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:10,200
had too much smoke that night

680
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,839
yeah no and um Rattlers yeah a lot of

681
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,120
rattlesnakes a lot of rattlesnakes I

682
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:19,079
remember climbing up um the what that

683
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,239
wash one you know that steep path and

684
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:24,480
and putting my hand up on something and

685
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,640
hearing the rattle you know and just

686
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,860
jumping back like Jim did throw himself

687
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,200
into yeah

688
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:32,459
it's such a a shock you know yeah you

689
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,100
don't mess around with those things and

690
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,640
you hear that rattle you jump right we

691
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:37,639
have them out here

692
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:43,678
area you know I think you survived you

693
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,740
know I've heard that you can survive a

694
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,500
rattlesnake yeah but of course you do

695
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,659
mostly you know but they do say that you

696
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:56,519
know it's it's pretty pretty yeah

697
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:58,500
36 48 hours which would have meant if we

698
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,859
were out there on our own which we often

699
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,119
were yeah

700
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:04,979
lie in the shade and hope you had enough

701
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,739
water because if you start to try to get

702
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:11,460
out you send it through your system and

703
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,558
yeah I remember Jim gave us the um Jimbo

704
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,860
you had those little rattlesnake kits

705
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,859
right

706
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,659
that they make you feel safe

707
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,640
had her in them that you're supposed to

708
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:35,640
slash at the uh oh my God

709
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,440
and then there was something that like a

710
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,320
suction thing I wasn't there that you're

711
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,080
supposed to pull the venom out oh yeah

712
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,700
yeah yeah well those came later and they

713
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:48,119
were more accurate because they were a

714
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,940
empty big hypodermic and when you press

715
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:53,119
down they would suck in oh yeah if you

716
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,380
applied them within one minute

717
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,658
being bitten

718
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,000
um it would get some venom out of the

719
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:02,159
bite site before distributed to your

720
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,980
Bloods unless you got struck on the neck

721
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,299
then you're [ __ ] crazy then you're a

722
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,298
goner yeah probably

723
00:31:08,538 --> 00:31:13,940
we nicknamed it the salt mine yeah

724
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:17,579
because it would make you sweat so much

725
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:21,298
it was about four that was only about 12

726
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:23,460
or 1300 feet vertical only but at the

727
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:26,940
bottom end where Doug and I first worked

728
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,460
it was 1600 feet and all right we

729
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,820
that's where you and I actually went in

730
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,940
originally to the old garden and then we

731
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:38,700
started hiking Upstream to look for a

732
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,500
new garden and we were we couldn't find

733
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,720
anything that met our standards for four

734
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,000
hours or something like that and then we

735
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,100
sat down you take a break and we looked

736
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,140
up above and we said wow that looks like

737
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:52,678
a little alluvial Plateau maybe up there

738
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,240
there it was The Double E I think I have

739
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,298
already told map we called it the double

740
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,599
e because if you get the actual topo map

741
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:02,879
of that area which I won't disclosed you

742
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:05,699
it fell right under the word something

743
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,380
Creek and where the two e's were in

744
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,778
Creek was exactly where the garden was

745
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,020
so funny that's how we named it the

746
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:14,398
double e that makes sense it was a

747
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:17,038
beautiful you know that's the other

748
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:21,239
thing that uh I sort of inspired me as

749
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,099
well or at least the right was it was a

750
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,538
beautiful

751
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:28,500
you know setting you know this oh yeah

752
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:30,000
you know I was crazy action those desert

753
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,759
Canyons where they've got live water

754
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,500
whether you have the sycamores and not

755
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,960
too sure if there's many cottonwoods but

756
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,519
Alders uh you know anyway a a riparian

757
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,740
growth they call it you know that grows

758
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,839
alongside the streams of course it's

759
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,880
just gorgeous down there and we had a

760
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,678
swimming hole too not exactly you know

761
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,440
almost like a swimming pool that opened

762
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,298
up Jim didn't it after the flood I think

763
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,640
anyway there was a place where you we

764
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:58,200
could plunge you know and swim four or

765
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,360
five Strokes

766
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,298
um so you know In the Heat of the summer

767
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:05,459
oh yeah right down there and of course

768
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:08,519
we drank straight from the creek all the

769
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,558
time because Upstream you know we're up

770
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:15,240
towards the little town that we won't

771
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:17,460
mention but Upstream of us it was dry so

772
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,859
you knew the water was fresh and you

773
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,940
know we just drank straight from the and

774
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:23,939
it was safe

775
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,860
show you yeah it came out below the town

776
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,200
it didn't flow through the town right

777
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:30,778
otherwise it could be polluted when it

778
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,240
rained of course and it was a big summer

779
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:36,419
Sunder thunderstorm it could wash

780
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,640
through it if someone had driven across

781
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:42,059
it and there might be oil in it but for

782
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,159
it to go miles uh yeah it and us

783
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:46,139
actually drink at that moment yeah it

784
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,019
would be so dilute yeah

785
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:52,740
but through the summer it was pretty dry

786
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:56,278
for several miles above us and but it

787
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,859
somehow the the water came above surface

788
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,538
in our section and that's why it was

789
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:03,058
also safe because if you stood on the

790
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:05,339
rim of the canyon in the summer with all

791
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,139
the trees you couldn't see water yeah

792
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:09,299
there was only one or two spots that

793
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,760
we'd see a glint of water if you walked

794
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:15,179
along the canyon Edge which takes hours

795
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,639
anyway yeah yeah it was it was quite

796
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,679
nice and we also realized that fishermen

797
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,480
aren't going to go down in 100 degree

798
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,179
heat

799
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,858
1600 feet or whatever yeah to go fishing

800
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,720
and then have to hike out in the heat in

801
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:30,838
the afternoon no no

802
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:34,079
no so Johnny was there during skunk one

803
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,759
right the skunk one girl yep yep do you

804
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,338
remember any of the scents as you could

805
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,139
describe them of this skunk one crop as

806
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:42,239
it was going through flour

807
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,919
um close-up close-up smells if you can

808
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,898
remember

809
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,480
yeah it was obviously completely

810
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:51,480
different from the sativa which was in

811
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,240
my opinion a lovely scent you know in

812
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,039
fact Jimbo had a good idea of um of

813
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,858
course we were up against the legality

814
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:01,820
and or illegality of it then but to make

815
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:05,338
the the sativa into um

816
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,380
Ascent what do you call a perfume for oh

817
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:09,299
yeah yeah yeah I don't know what

818
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,539
happened with that but but the skunk was

819
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,460
completely different you know I mean

820
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:18,239
obviously it was just like somebody just

821
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:21,960
wasn't as bad as as you know a roadkill

822
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:25,019
skunk but it was very very very powerful

823
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,358
and much more

824
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:30,119
um sort of um what's the word um

825
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:33,480
accurate almost you know much more well

826
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:36,059
potent true but a more sort of uh

827
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,460
pungent there you go yeah yeah it was it

828
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,440
was not as pleasant by any means the

829
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,079
sativa was beautiful I can still

830
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,420
remember there was scoldiness to it a

831
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,160
second so there was a skunkiness to it

832
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,579
and the skunk one with some sweet

833
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:52,500
absolutely absolutely right Jimbo yeah

834
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,780
well greater after harvest and they were

835
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:58,800
dry because when you crush the bud to

836
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:01,619
roll it it filled a room yeah

837
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,260
that's wild I didn't remember much about

838
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:06,599
how it smelled while it was growing I

839
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,020
loved the scent of all those flowers but

840
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:12,059
it was particularly skunk once it was

841
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:14,099
dry once it's manicured and then you're

842
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,199
gonna break a bud but you didn't even

843
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,119
have to break it but if you open a jar

844
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,259
of that even in the house the whole

845
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,260
house would be oh yeah

846
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,000
was the sativa strain and um

847
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,220
um you know those blooms you could pull

848
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,219
them down you know obviously in the

849
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:40,439
Autumn you know and just brush it brush

850
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:42,000
them a little bit God it was delightful

851
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,320
it's just great

852
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,300
um and and you really didn't need to

853
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,460
brush him that much as I say I mean you

854
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,280
could if the wind was right when you was

855
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,440
crossing the creek or just walking

856
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,260
around a camp you know I was heading on

857
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,740
the far side of the um from the garden

858
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:01,140
from the blue we were plane and um you

859
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:03,719
could absolutely smell it and it's a big

860
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:06,239
thing I won't go on too much about my

861
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,098
book but it was a big thing in

862
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:12,659
um the close scrapes that I wrote about

863
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:14,760
in the novel uh with the with the uh you

864
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:17,578
know the have the we nearly got caught

865
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,920
because of the um the smell and I

866
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,800
remember with when we came out when the

867
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,900
year that uh Sammy helped us Jim yeah

868
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,740
this was this wonderful crazy guy that

869
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:32,460
helped us with the work um the Swiss guy

870
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:35,459
um we we we we we had that camper that I

871
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:38,699
got remember and um we put all the boxes

872
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:42,119
on the bunk on on over the cab you

873
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:45,358
remember that that setup and Sammy and I

874
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:48,480
drove it out and um we went to we came

875
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,578
around the anyway long story but we

876
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,199
wanted to have breakfast or lunch or

877
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:56,220
whatever it was we were driving out you

878
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:58,078
know and um we we of course you want it

879
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:01,078
inside the camper the smell was

880
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,920
overpowering but even outside you could

881
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:07,560
smell it and um and there was a scene we

882
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,880
we went into the cafe to get some you

883
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,059
know to have a meal

884
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,800
in this little town and the sheriff the

885
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:16,980
deputy sheriff's truck kept pulled

886
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,260
alongside the the camper it was like a

887
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,659
four-wheel drive you know with a camper

888
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,700
rig on top yeah and I'm looking through

889
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,858
the window and I go I don't know if I'm

890
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:30,358
allowed to use foul language yeah yeah

891
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:32,578
yeah you're okay yeah you know this is

892
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:34,739
dodgy to put it mildly you know yeah

893
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:37,380
half the I don't know about half the

894
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:41,338
crop but boxes and boxes of wheat enough

895
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:44,579
to put you in alone yeah yeah it gets

896
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:47,099
you put away and um I was terrified that

897
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:50,820
the sheriff would you know probably some

898
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:53,359
tea totaling Mormon oh for sure some

899
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,359
backwards

900
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,980
what the hell is that smell you know

901
00:38:55,858 --> 00:39:00,779
anyway yeah suffice to say that but I I

902
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,480
think I've got a fairly good scene in

903
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,460

that's crazy yeah New Orleans yeah I

922
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,259
went to New Orleans and uh it's taken a

923
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:57,419
time of course here we are Jesus 40

924
00:39:52,260 --> 00:40:01,440
years later but I I wrote it um uh uh in

925
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,940
the in the 2000s it took me that I I was

926
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,440
actually living in New Zealand and wrote

927
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:09,960
a version that was worthless so I wrote

928
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,059
it again when I had some time when my

929
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,519
children were taking care of themselves

930
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:17,159
a bit more anyway when I was I live up

931
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,420
here in Taos New Mexico yeah and um

932
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:21,659
anyway

933
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,420
um so I and I tried to get a um a

934
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:27,420
traditional publisher you know um an

935
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,338
agent and the whole deal but this is so

936
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,858
so very few of those now you know

937
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,000
especially for new unknown Riders you

938
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:35,699
know yeah

939
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,739
um you know everything's it's the whole

940
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,819
publishing thing is just like a film

941
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,739
business I've worked in the film

942
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,180
business it's all marketing how you

943
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:44,159
Market yourself how much money you have

944
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:45,960
to Market yourself everything yeah it's

945
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,759
all that well I guess my point was that

946
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,858
it's all in turmoil it changes every

947
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,079
week you know almost you know every year

948
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:53,880
you know nobody really

949
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,220
um knows what's gonna happen next you

950
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,039
know the whole shift to

951
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:01,980
um Kindles and um yeah you know the

952
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,079
digital and audio books so anyway the

953
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,719
point of all that being that as I sort

954
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:11,039
of tried to get uh many times I send it

955
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,899
to to 60 70 agents and Publishers and

956
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,599
you know got sick and tired of the

957
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:18,480
rejection so I almost gave up on it yeah

958
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,460
but but I decided recently I actually a

959
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,858
production designer on a film I was

960
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,420
working on Reddit and a couple years ago

961
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:26,699
and he said this is great you've got to

962
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,400
get it out I'm trying not to slap my arm

963
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:32,699
back too much but um it's a good story

964
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,619
yeah I'm obviously biased but thanks to

965
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,559
that man sitting on the top of the

966
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,539
screen there you know and uh yeah I mean

967
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,099
it was uh you know somebody once told me

968
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,900
I should write a memoir and I said no

969
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:45,599
it's that wouldn't be interesting you

970
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,920
know because for all the risk that we

971
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,260
took

972
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,820
um there was nothing that thrilling

973
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,599
happened you know we weren't chased by

974
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:57,000
the law or um yeah yeah there was you

975
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:00,000
know we were pretty organized and um we

976
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,539
kept no gun fights no nothing out yeah

977
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,639
right and and and Jim he's very thorough

978
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:07,320
bloke and uh you know I remember I've

979
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:09,319
watched a little bit of your previous

980
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,059
one and you know talking about

981
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,660
scattering the the leaves in the morning

982
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:17,759
you know we would we would always we

983
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:19,679
call it a watering Moon you know the

984
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,480
early phase of the moon was always the

985
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,819
one you wanted to be watering in because

986
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,559
we in the summer we would take turns we

987
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,180
didn't both need to go in you know

988
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:30,059
especially especially the first year

989
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:32,578
when we only had the one Garden second

990
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:35,460
year it was more work but one guy could

991
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:38,220
do it you know it's hard work sure you

992
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,900
get that pump going and um the Briggs

993
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:41,899
and Stratton and it was roaring you know

994
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,160
and you spent the next four hours

995
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,380
blundering around trying to keep the

996
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,000
hoses from you know

997
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,820
um

998
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,019
spilling over we had a like a little uh

999
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:56,039
Terrace system you know with little

1000
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:58,559
walls like um like a race Patty in um in

1001
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:59,940
Southeast Asia you know and uh and um

1002
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,000
anyway the point of all that was the

1003
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:06,000
that yeah we would um it was great to

1004
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,338
have the the moon Waxing come over the

1005
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,500
Canyon Rim we were in a nice East-West

1006
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:12,420
part that we chose it

1007
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,780
um so that we'd have maximum sun right

1008
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:18,599
but of course it helped also for maximum

1009
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:22,440
Moonlight and um and so

1010
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,900
um the um the um you know the watering

1011
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,079
was was one guy and

1012
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,579
um that was always of course a risk as

1013
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,099
well you know you're on your own down

1014
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:34,500
there yeah Anything Could Happen you get

1015
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:36,780
stuck there scorpion you just twist your

1016
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,880
ankle and you probably couldn't get out

1017
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,980
for two or three days you know I mean

1018
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,318
you wouldn't have died hopefully from a

1019
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,119
twisted ankle but you would have been I

1020
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:47,699
remember you did a terrible

1021
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,880
um twist yourself once Jimbo too I

1022
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:53,519
remember you were struggling to get out

1023
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,519
because of that and um

1024
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:59,039
anyway it was it was a great adventure

1025
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:01,619
that's for sure you know and again I am

1026
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,719
it was so beautiful and and one of the

1027
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:07,140
things I always I remember later on as

1028
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:10,439
well was um having the um that the water

1029
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:12,960
because of the um continued growth and

1030
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,400
the drought in the southwest Jim you'll

1031
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,858
maybe know more about this than I

1032
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,358
because I went to New Mexico and you of

1033
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:20,358
course today but the um

1034
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:28,980
the creek was so depleted that guys who

1035
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:32,039
went in and used our setup the next

1036
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,559
couple of years could barely oh there we

1037
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:37,199
are

1038
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:40,799
that's funny yes in 1980 roughly and my

1039
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:43,078
daughter who's 48 years old right now

1040
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,660
that's amazing you guys are good shape

1041
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,900
look at that we were in super shape look

1042
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:52,259
at Jim hey you didn't go you go in and

1043
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:55,440
out of that Canyon man every week you

1044
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,880
were hard as they say yeah you could do

1045
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,740
some you guys could have been doing some

1046
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,838
MMA or ultimate fighting back then with

1047
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:02,818
that that kind of shape and climbing

1048
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:03,619
rocks and [ __ ] yeah

1049
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:07,980
yeah

1050
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:11,099
so so a question I I do have for you

1051
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,079
it you know Jim even just since I've

1052
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:15,000
I've met him and slowly become friends

1053
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,440
and and learned from him I've I've had a

1054
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,739
lot of synchronicities in my life just

1055
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,420
weird little occurrences like weird

1056
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:23,519
um things just keep falling in place

1057
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,440
with different people just that never

1058
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,719
really happened would never really fall

1059
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,740
together did you did he influence your

1060
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:36,419
life spiritually or anything at all

1061
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:39,719
you know absolutely uh I I I'm not a

1062
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:44,639
particularly I'm I was coming from the

1063
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:47,338
cynical skeptical world of of uh of an

1064
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,259
urban environment London UK is very very

1065
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:51,119
atheist like I've noticed that like

1066
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,380
watching the TV program it's common to

1067
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,740
be atheists there whereas in the U.S

1068
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:59,039
it's not you know yeah no I I am still a

1069
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:01,919
very much an atheist oh my yeah

1070
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,199
I don't think that the frankly religion

1071
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,500
has done more good than harm in the

1072
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:08,818
world I'd argue we could debate that for

1073
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,619
a long while

1074
00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:13,199
um but absolutely I think what Jim

1075
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:16,380
reminded and the experience reminded me

1076
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:18,419
I was was uh I'd left home at 18 to go

1077
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,160
to the cities you know I was a farm boy

1078
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,539
and it brought back to me and again this

1079
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,179
is in the book

1080
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:26,338
um the value if you will of wilderness

1081
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:28,500
and um and I've become more of an

1082
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:31,920
animist because of that you know I I

1083
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:34,858
don't follow the uh I I don't even

1084
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,079
frankly have a lot of time for the um

1085
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:40,500
the Eastern religions that have come

1086
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:43,560
into and and Jim gave me some of that I

1087
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:46,559
would say but not in any kind of a

1088
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,259
conventional way do I think I I think a

1089
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,880
lot of the a lot of the popularity of

1090
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,980
the Western religions Buddhism and

1091
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,079
Hinduism and everything

1092
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,579
um and Jim and I may disagree on this

1093
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,280
but you know I think it's it's very

1094
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:01,440
superficial in so many ways well you

1095
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,119
know especially in your state I would

1096
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,000
argue you know California you know

1097
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,740
there's a lot yeah that's a bollocks

1098
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,219
pardon me you know that I mean Beverly

1099
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:13,078
Hills Buddhists are kind of yeah

1100
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:15,659
you know it's just they just grab the

1101
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,700
the the the the cool side of it oh it's

1102
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:19,440
peaceful or I mean there's nothing wrong

1103
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:22,318
with meditating that's a great thing to

1104
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,139
do but you know you don't study also the

1105
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:28,639
the four noble truths and samsara and

1106
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:30,960
and you know I tried it I I I I I I I

1107
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,759
meditated up here and did the slow

1108
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,559
walking and everything and tried to get

1109
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,160
into it as I got older looking for some

1110
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:40,019
answers but in answer your question I

1111
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,118
think that my spirituality lies in the

1112
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:44,519
natural world this is perhaps isn't very

1113
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:47,700
original but you know that's my and and

1114
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:50,280
those two years in that Canyon

1115
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:52,799
um absolutely you know built that into

1116
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,619
me much more took me back to my years

1117
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,539
growing up on a farm but also the the

1118
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:00,358
feeling that there's if there is any

1119
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:03,420
power out there it comes in the natural

1120
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:05,039
world trees the the creek the stones

1121
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,440
even you know that that's what I believe

1122
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,980
it's maybe a little fascinating because

1123
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,000
like you know um through my own journey

1124
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,159
in life

1125
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,539
um I I've gone from so much as like

1126
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,818
someone who's really into Satanism

1127
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:19,440
because I started off Catholic so of

1128
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:21,719
course as a young punk rock kid that's

1129
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,099
like 12 13. I immediately get into

1130
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:25,019
Satanism because it's like the complete

1131
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:27,359
opposite right like just what is the

1132
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:29,099
opposite of what I my parents like is

1133
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,858
that what can make my parents mad right

1134
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:34,140
right but after a while I got you know

1135
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:35,759
of course Very as I got older and into

1136
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:40,318
into science and botany I got more into

1137
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,359
atheism and logic and reasoning and

1138
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,159
over time I've just kind of especially

1139
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:46,858
with plants learning from Plants being

1140
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,719
around plants so long I've I've come to

1141
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:50,400
realize and I don't know how much it

1142
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,919
makes sense because I've never really

1143
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,960
got I've never really vibed with like

1144
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,760
the whole hippie like mother earth type

1145
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,619
thing but I think that's probably

1146
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,020
closest to what I believe now as an

1147
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,480
adult that that there's a lot more

1148
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:04,980
conscious on this Earth than we have any

1149
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,240
clue just because it doesn't have a

1150
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,858
brain doesn't necessarily mean it can't

1151
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:11,098
communicate and communication is key

1152
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:12,900
like to all living beings and life and

1153
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:15,359
I've just kind of come to a similar

1154
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,579
conclusion in that if there is something

1155
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,980
existing it's probably very natural and

1156
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:22,079
been here among us as in the plants the

1157
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:23,579
the actual Earth and that's where a lot

1158
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,560
of this energy is probably coming from

1159
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,720
as best I can tell you know as a human

1160
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:28,739
who can't have any answers it seems to

1161
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:30,059
make the most sense to me after

1162
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:31,379
interacting with all these plants and

1163
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:32,159
how much they've changed my life for the

1164
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,858
better

1165
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,420
sure no no I agree more and to me

1166
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:40,019
there's a great deal more logic in the

1167
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:42,300
Life Force if you will coming from this

1168
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:45,119
this natural world that's been going for

1169
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,300
what what's the big bang 13 billion

1170
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,640
years or something yeah yeah

1171
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,500
than than believing that somebody walked

1172
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,179
out of off a mountain with some tablets

1173
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,579
with some rules on them you know I mean

1174
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:59,960
that's to me that's just nonsense and

1175
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:05,180
yeah very human very human created yeah

1176
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:07,880
it's still missing oh that's right huh

1177
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:10,318
what do they say who is it says if God

1178
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:14,579
if God hadn't existed man would have

1179
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:17,719
invented him right yeah right I mean I

1180
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:17,720
mean it's obviously uh

1181
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:30,599
1981 so at the end of 1981 I'm 41. oh

1182
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:31,800
wow okay yeah yeah we both 70 are you 72

1183
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:35,099
Nigel

1184
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:38,220
two weeks two weeks when's your birthday

1185
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:41,420
June 13th 13th yeah I didn't know that

1186
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:45,239
you got the old man to cough it up

1187
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:48,599
well you know also when you sleep next

1188
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:52,199
to a creek and and hear it in the sound

1189
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:54,359
at night in the wilderness in in the

1190
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:57,058
stars were as bright as you can ever

1191
00:50:54,358 --> 00:51:00,838
imagine you have you'd have to go

1192
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:03,240
very few places in America today to be

1193
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:06,659
away from City Lights in the town that

1194
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:08,759
was near us was hundreds of people so it

1195
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:11,759
there was no light for many many many

1196
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,400
miles right tens and tens and twenties

1197
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,700
of Miles as listening to the sound of a

1198
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,280
creek flowing by for a year or two

1199
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:21,598
the time that you go every week it's

1200
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,579
just so

1201
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,579
healing it's a healing thing

1202
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:31,559
with a poem that was translated by Gary

1203
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:32,940
Schneider you know that name the um the

1204
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:35,220
poet anyway

1205
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,838
um it's I'll uh

1206
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:38,639
um I walk for thousands of you anyway

1207
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:41,460
it's a long story but it's uh it ends up

1208
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:43,558
I'll sleep by the creek and purify my

1209
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,179
ears that's

1210
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:48,800
um it's it's from the Cold Mountain

1211
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:52,679
poems of the of the I think 8th century

1212
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,260
reclusion and Shan yeah that's how I

1213
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,719
opened the book so that was what got us

1214
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:00,900
so that you know to get back to your

1215
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:03,959
thoughts about the experience and and

1216
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:07,139
everything it was so lovely being down

1217
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:10,440
there and I never felt like even if they

1218
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:13,920
had discovered us down there the chances

1219
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,240
of them you know and Jim and I discussed

1220
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,400
it you know that they would probably

1221
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:18,719
wait for us to hike out with something

1222
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,599
that they could get you know they

1223
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,399
wouldn't stake out the garden because

1224
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,420
you don't travel down there just to get

1225
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,300
you and they know you're going to come

1226
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:30,119
back out exactly and um you know and

1227
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:33,240
would they and if we were down there and

1228
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,800
we had at least you know a chance we we

1229
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:36,419
could get away from those guys probably

1230
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,339
you know I mean yeah and they don't know

1231
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,619
what you have down there as far as it

1232
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:42,299
could have been uh you know cartel with

1233
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,559
weapons not just cartel but you know

1234
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,180
what I mean people with weapons anything

1235
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,640
so yeah they would definitely wait for

1236
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:49,679
you guys to come out loading pass right

1237
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:51,960
well in the nearby Canyon gym there was

1238
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,239
a there was a cartel that went to work

1239
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,780
there didn't they and they always were

1240
00:52:54,239 --> 00:53:01,078
were packing heat weren't they except

1241
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:04,380
that was much longer after us I mean was

1242
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:06,140
it recent years in in the 2000s or was

1243
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:10,440
it as late

1244
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:13,558
but also we had day packs

1245
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,260
that today people call Bug Out bags or

1246
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,900
for for me it was like I think my

1247
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,119
nickname was a parachute so if we knew

1248
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,880
people were coming down into the canyon

1249
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,640
we're above us or something crazy

1250
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,160
um we could go down our Canyon

1251
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:31,980
which led to another Canyon which led to

1252
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:34,199
another Canyon and we could it could

1253
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,940
take a day or two but we could disappear

1254
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:39,539
and never be found because we didn't

1255
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:40,559
park a car ever for those two years out

1256
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:42,838
there

1257
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,760
um maybe the first year a little bit but

1258
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:47,759
the second year we had people drop us

1259
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,819
off and pick us up every week because it

1260
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,559
was too risky because like I mentioned

1261
00:53:50,818 --> 00:53:55,139
earlier the guys in the canyon next to

1262
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,540
us they parked a truck week after week

1263
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:59,159
there and eventually the Rancher called

1264
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:00,900
the forest service they checked the

1265
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:03,598
place and what do you know they're from

1266
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,818
Jerome which was the hippie Capital so

1267
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,980
they just waited till they came out and

1268
00:54:05,818 --> 00:54:11,719
took everything home to Jerome and

1269
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,719
showed up at their house and got them

1270
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:19,859
well I was going to say that was another

1271
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:22,520
thing that um you know we we were

1272
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:24,838
one of a better term we were pretty

1273
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:27,539
rigorous about it we were professional

1274
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:29,400
about it and mostly because Jim insisted

1275
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:31,739
I'd say hey we could drive the hell out

1276
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,358
there no not always but you know that we

1277
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:35,578
would have a few back and forth because

1278
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:38,279
who wants to hike another three miles

1279
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:40,500
you know and um so when we did leave

1280
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,200
cars we would leave them a long way away

1281
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:46,019
you know and and make that extra effort

1282
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:48,358
to get in there you know right um and

1283
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:50,940
then as Jim says the second year when we

1284
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:53,098
really have we we doubled our yield I

1285
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,920
think or double that size because we we

1286
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:58,680
took another we made another Garden the

1287
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,019
the second year and um but anyway sorry

1288
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:02,699
you were going to ask something Matt so

1289
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:04,500
one thing that I know people are going

1290
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:07,439
to want me to ask before we finish up

1291
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:10,619
and I it it

1292
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,599
someone asked if you guys ever saw UFOs

1293
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:15,380
in the sky out there in those clear

1294
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:15,380
clear nights

1295
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:22,500
um well no I I didn't

1296
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:25,019
Jim's got some other stories that uh he

1297
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:28,260
might tell I do remember the satellites

1298
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:31,440

00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,380
those days they were much much less

1311
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,780
um

1312
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,338

can remember first seeing them and

1314
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:09,659
thinking well what the hell is that you

1315

1316
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:15,960
train yet the what mate Starling train

1317
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:17,818
Elon musk's I there was one one morning

1318
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,318
I I was driving somewhere it was like 5

1319
00:56:17,818 --> 00:56:21,480
a.m and it was Pitch Black outside

1320
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:23,460
driving in my car and I look up and

1321
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,579
there was a stream of Lights like dots

1322
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:28,740
going across the whole Sky wow and I I

1323
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:30,119
stopped my car got out in the middle of

1324
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:31,019
the street there's other people stopping

1325
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,980
their car getting out in the Middle

1326
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:34,139
Street it's the first time that

1327
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,760
anybody's seen Starling train yet and

1328
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:37,500
everybody's thinking this is a big huge

1329
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,300
massive UFO because it is just going

1330
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,920
across the whole Sky yeah it turned out

1331
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,559
wow they have not seen that but it's

1332
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,318
crazy when you see it it's crazy

1333
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:49,559
geosynchronous and there's over 1500 now

1334
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:51,358
so how far apart would they to go around

1335
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:53,880
the circumference of the earth would

1336
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:55,679
that make them it was it I mean it was

1337
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,980
it stretched across at least half the

1338
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:02,098
sky wow that's how and and there were

1339
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:04,139
probably eight or nine dots throughout

1340
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:05,720
that half of the sky we saw great

1341
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:08,699
meteorites

1342
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:11,098
sure and once I was hiking out to the

1343
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:14,098
canyon and I got to the edge of the

1344
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:16,440
canyon near near Sunset you know in the

1345
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:18,599
late afternoon and I heard the sound and

1346
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:23,280
I looked down and coming up the canyon

1347
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:25,619
where was a jet in our an Air Force jet

1348
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,859
hundreds of feet below the rim I mean he

1349
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,660
was at Treetop but he was flying up the

1350
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:33,779
canyon and I just stood there and the

1351
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:35,460
Sonic room was massive and at the end of

1352
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,040
the canyon he just gunned it and shot

1353
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,260
straight up and out and I was like wow

1354
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:42,659
so they were that they were doing

1355
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:45,859
training I I believe you know because

1356
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:48,440
the Russians were invading Afghanistan

1357
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:50,519
around that period

1358
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,858
perfect place to fly around like

1359
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:55,440
Afghanistan yeah they were doing lots of

1360
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:58,139
desert training yeah

1361
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,000
luckily that was practicing parachuting

1362
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:01,679
and stuff yeah I know hey do you know

1363
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,019
the definition of using a parachute now

1364
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:05,639
do you know what that definition is so

1365
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:08,420
Jim's parachute to get out might I mean

1366
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:11,179
a little different now

1367
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:15,139

00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:51,000
came to live in Taos I built a house up

1380
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:55,380
here I sold it and then I sailed across

1381
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,858
the Pacific I went wow what a life oh

1382

yeah kind of like I mean that's my dream

1383
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:04,078
man sailing and just getting out just

1384
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,059
doing it you know yeah well there's a

1385
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,599
friend of mine just sailed from Cabo San

1386
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:11,700
Lucas to Tahiti and um that's hard work

1387
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,099
though you know blue water's failing you

1388
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:16,439
know the islands are the great thing you

1389
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:18,180
know yeah because the sailing's fine but

1390
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,280
it's exhausting too you never sleep

1391
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:24,598
probably and you know on a small boat

1392
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,220

crewing all the time working you get a

1395
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:34,500
few hours skip as they say where I come

1396
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:36,358

lovely Town people are loyal to the

1414
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,818
Highlander series yeah

1415
01:00:20,298 --> 01:00:25,798
one of my guys I I'm a location manager

1416
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,180
you know and so I have a crew obviously

1417
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:30,119
I work here in New Mexico I'm still

1418
01:00:27,179 --> 01:00:32,578
working I'm doing a thing for um uh it's

1419
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,019
one of their films yeah anyway yeah why

1420
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:36,420
don't they want to do a Mad Jack film

1421
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:38,639
that's a real ticket

1422
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,798
they're getting a book those boys I know

1423
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:44,400
the um the assistants I'm gonna give him

1424
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:46,798
a book I mean that's the story like I I

1425
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,298
think of all the all the stories I've

1426
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:49,980
seen on on

1427
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:52,500
um the history of

1428
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:55,740
the the Genesis of this scene of the

1429
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:58,079
Cannabis scene and since I've had magic

1430
01:00:55,739 --> 01:01:00,959
on on these these have been the most

1431
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:04,140
popular shows we've ever done like by a

1432
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:07,019
large portion so I know that at least

1433
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:08,940
our and this is a niche type thing to be

1434
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:11,338
this far into genetics and breeding and

1435
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,500
strains but we have a pretty good sized

1436
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:15,779
audience for that and

1437
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,539
man the amount that they've tuned into

1438
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:20,400
just this story tells me that like

1439
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:21,838
that's something that people at Netflix

1440
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,059
should probably take interest in

1441
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:26,159
personally like I know I would be super

1442
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:28,319
into seeing that you know

1443
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:29,940
yeah you know obviously that's my hope

1444
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,099
as well you know I just would like to

1445
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:34,980
get the story out there before I'm too

1446
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:37,980
bloody old you know and can't and can't

1447
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:40,260
do much more but um yeah and uh

1448
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:42,358
I think obviously there's a there's a

1449
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:44,339
certain obviously with the way it's

1450
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:46,500
suddenly in a sense could become

1451
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:49,259
illegalized at least since Colorado

1452
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,719
Colorado was the first I think right uh

1453
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:54,359
California and then Colorado or was it

1454
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:55,919
no no maybe Colorado went fully legal I

1455
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:56,940
thought it was Colorado yeah I think

1456
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,519
you're right I think they went fully

1457
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:02,159
legal first yeah they were 10 years ago

something so so so radical and dangerous

1469

1478
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:52,680
what I love about this legalization that

01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,960
we have in a sense we were Vindicated we

1480

modern-day Moonshiners you know we were

doing just what the guys still do in in

1483
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:04,920
Kentucky in places like that absolutely

1484
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:06,839
you know and um and yeah that's uh I

1485
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,059
would like to think this story and there

1486
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:10,679
are a few marijuana stories out there or

1487
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:13,859
smuggling stories you know there's the

1488
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:15,419
well blow you know what it is oh yeah he

1489
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:17,400
just recently passed rest in peace

1490
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,559
Boston George yeah did he really yeah

1491
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,318
yeah unfortunately and that's cocaine

1492
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:24,000
which in my view is a stupid drug he

1493
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:27,779
started on cannabis in Matt Manhattan

1494
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,420
Beach as a campus dealer yeah yeah no I

1495
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:33,780
mean cocaine in my view is an absolutely

1496
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:34,559
ridiculous job oh yeah no yeah an ego

1497
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:37,200
drug

1498
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:39,240
or what mate ego drug yeah there you go

1499
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:40,798
you feel like God for 20 minutes and

1500
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:43,919
then you need another no it's stupid

1501
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:46,019
yeah but marijuana is I don't know I

1502
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,180
don't go on too much but I think it's um

1503
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:49,500
you know Colorado and all the other

1504
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:51,239
states have proven that the system

1505
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,739
didn't collapse not everybody's

1506
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:55,739
scratching into each other on the

1507
01:03:52,739 --> 01:04:01,279
freeway Christ I remember driving stoned

1508
01:03:55,739 --> 01:04:01,279
you know you doing 25 yeah 25 and a 50.

1509
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:06,379
yeah you drive extra safe

1510
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,858
careful you know so you know and how

1511
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,798
many people live

1512
01:04:10,858 --> 01:04:15,480
how many alcoholic these are all cliches

1513
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:19,500
but you know I've seen so many

1514
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:22,639
alcoholics in my time and and um no it's

1515
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:25,079
it's it's proven that it's it's

1516
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:27,118
essentially harmless but but on that

1517
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:30,180
note I would also say and stop me if I'm

1518
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,280
talking too much but um no is that we

1519
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:34,318
should we shouldn't think of it as the

1520
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,559
Panacea you know when we do need to be

1521
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:39,000
careful of it because the way you guys

1522
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,680
you know the way the modern Growers are

1523
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,199
doing it what do we have Jim what

1524
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,659
percentage THC did we have in the buds

1525
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:48,239
eight into twelve roughly if you're

1526
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:51,719
lucky right and what's it now

1527
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:54,298
some say up to 35 36 40 somewhere in

1528
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:55,858
there four times is powerful you know

1529
01:04:54,298 --> 01:04:58,400
and that's just the weed not even the

1530
01:04:55,858 --> 01:05:01,440
extra extracts are at 90 now 99 you know

1531
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,940
exactly and and somebody taking that for

1532
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,338
the first time and getting behind the

1533
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:07,139
wheel or yeah that would really really

1534
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:10,078
screw someone out that's bloody

1535
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:12,358
dangerous you know we can and and I

1536
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:15,000
think there are certain um also medical

1537
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:17,219
uh mental issues with usually as well

1538
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,318
you know oh yeah yeah some people can't

1539
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:20,399
quite handle it you know

1540
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:22,259
um there are there are a lot of years

1541
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,139
where I could not smoke without it

1542
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:26,760
triggering anxiety depression anything

1543
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:28,920
like that and and it was just one of

1544
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,720
those things I had to get used to

1545
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,940
um as far as

1546
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:35,399
like come to the conclusion like my

1547
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:38,039
hormones in my body change as I'm as I

1548
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,358
get older I can't smoke like I used to

1549
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,940
like least during those years I could

1550
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:44,759
it's changed again for whatever reason I

1551
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:47,099
can smoke Non-Stop and not have that but

1552
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,319
during those years it was really really

1553
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:50,700
triggering stuff and it was not a good

1554
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:52,619
time for me to be using it only

1555
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:54,899
triggered and made it worse so yeah it's

1556
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,640
definitely not the the cure-all um I see

1557
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,920
I see CBD stores everywhere in

1558
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,900
California now not just everywhere I

1559
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:04,019
mean in gas stations or selling CBD oil

1560
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:07,260
they're selling Arizona CBD joints you

1561
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:09,239
know CBD everything Delta eight Delta 10

1562
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:10,559
specifically which are extracted from

1563
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:11,699
hemp

1564
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,500
um and a lot of people don't know that

1565
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:15,539
the other day I was in a cigarette store

1566
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,159
and I about because I get pretty

1567
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:20,039
autistic with this stuff like when I

1568
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:21,358
hear misinformation it makes my face

1569
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:23,519
turn red especially if it's something

1570
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,038
I'm very passionate about and this this

1571
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,420
lady was I was waiting to get Vape stuff

1572
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:28,859
right at The Vape it was a vape

1573
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:33,358
cigarette store and they sell cigarettes

1574
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:34,500
and and CBD and everything there and I I

1575
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:35,940
was listening to this lady she was

1576
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,519
trying to get real advice real medical

1577
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:40,619
advice from a cigarette store guy right

1578
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:43,199
on on what she should be using he's like

1579
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:44,818
well you know Delta eight Delta 9 Delta

1580
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,500
10 they're all made from sativa so

1581
01:06:44,818 --> 01:06:47,838
you're pretty safe there and I was just

1582
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,699
like

1583
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:52,318
why why are you just making it up why

1584
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:54,358
are you telling this lady medical advice

1585
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:55,440
you know like she sativa might mean one

1586
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:57,480
thing to her

1587
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,099
and whatever she's taking might

1588
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,318
completely trigger the opposite effect

1589
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:03,660
and it could be a really bad bad

1590
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:06,659
situation experience she may never try

1591
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:08,219
cannabis again you know it may be such a

1592
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:09,838
Negative experience and then you and

1593
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:12,298
then and then it's all because someone

1594
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,578
gave her bad info you know and and that

1595
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:16,380
that ruins it for her for good so yeah

1596
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:18,900
it's just constant around here and a lot

1597
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:21,119
of it they're selling Chinese sourced um

1598
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:22,740
CBD and a lot of people don't know the

1599
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,720
Chinese government was paying their

1600
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:27,779
people to grow hemp

1601
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:30,538
um in Mass to leech toxins from the soil

1602
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:32,819
in China so a lot of these were these

1603
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:34,140
hemp hemp plants were grown to Leach

1604
01:07:32,818 --> 01:07:35,818
toxins from the soil and they're using

1605
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:38,038
that sending it over here in Mass to use

1606
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:39,599
our CBD market for extraction now I

1607
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:42,960
don't I don't know that those Metals

1608
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,519
make it in I don't know but that's not

1609
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,460
what people think they're getting they

1610
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:49,318
don't understand that and it's 99 of the

1611
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:52,798
CBD stuff in gas stations is that

1612
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:53,818
Chinese sourced CBD you know right so

1613
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:54,380
yeah

1614
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:57,480
yeah

1615
01:07:54,380 --> 01:08:00,000
and again I would say that you know to

1616
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,940
get back to this the uh the sort of

1617
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,818
increased strength of it now so and uh

1618
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:07,500
you know I don't think that

1619
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:09,779
impressionable teenagers should should

1620
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,539
know you know take in too much of this

1621
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,579
or uh you know maybe you know I think

1622
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:16,400
they're pretty well proven it affects um

1623
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:20,159
it affects

1624
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:22,379
undeveloped brains right and can cause

1625
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:24,059
uh what is it called emotional arrest

1626
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:26,338
meaning like a lot of people that start

1627
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:29,400
smoking when they're 12 emotionally tend

1628
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:31,079
to stay around that age emotionally you

1629
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:32,879
know that tends to happen and it's not

1630
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:34,859
always it's not everyone so it's not

1631
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,119
like a a blanket statement but it can

1632
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:38,039
happen

1633
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:39,659
um and so yeah like that was one of my

1634
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:42,960
things growing up I had a younger I have

1635
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:44,519
two younger brothers and I I was very

1636
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,140
cognizant that one of my brothers was

1637
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,179
already smoking pot and I didn't want

1638
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:50,279
him to think that I was an advocate

1639
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:51,539
necessarily of it knowing what I did so

1640
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:53,460
I had to hide what I did for a living

1641
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:55,259
for a long time from him and you know as

1642
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:56,819
he got older he thought yeah you're an

1643
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:58,079
idiot like why would you do that like I

1644
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:00,660
was already smoking but at the same time

1645
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:02,399
I didn't want him to think that I was

1646
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:03,659
telling him that this is what he should

1647
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,879
be doing that I think this is cool

1648
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:07,559
because I didn't and he's you know I

1649
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,020
mean I'm sure he's he's felt effects

1650
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,920
from it as he's gotten older

1651
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:15,719
yeah I mean I'm still a 12 year old so

1652
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:18,060
you know same with whether you agree

1653
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:20,759
that boo should be restricted to 21 or

1654
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:23,699
18 or something I mean it's the same in

1655
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:26,698
a sense you should be mature before you

1656
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:29,579
make that decision and um yeah I think

1657
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:32,479
there's a lot of uh uh you know jumping

1658
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:36,238
on the bandwagon now about weed and

1659
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:38,939
CBD and uh and I think we need to be

1660
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:41,519
cautious as well because it is a strong

1661
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:44,399
drug no doubt about it I when I first

1662
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:47,219
tried some of these Edibles you know oh

1663
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:50,219
clearly too much I was sprawled out for

1664
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:52,198
six hours yeah what's that drooling yeah

1665
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:54,439
yeah they've made me drool they've made

1666
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:57,000
me drool before

1667
01:09:54,439 --> 01:10:00,000
marijuana in the day you know and um

1668
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,859
yeah yeah yeah so we've got to be

1669
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,600
careful that's all I think you know and

1670
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:06,059
you know they sell this stuff for dogs

1671
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,880
too like the CBD oil and it reminds me

1672
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:10,380
of when the when me and my chick met she

1673
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,699
wasn't smoking anymore she smoked a lot

1674
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,619
when she was young but she hadn't smoked

1675
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:15,960
for years and I was like you know my

1676
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:17,159
friend sent me some CBD CBD oil she had

1677
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,399
some back pain and I was like let's try

1678
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:22,859
this but she hadn't had any THC in yours

1679
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:24,599
and there was a negligible amount of THC

1680
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:26,158
in some of these CBD extracts and people

1681
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,159
don't realize that because it's not done

1682
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:31,079
very carefully with some Sellers and she

1683
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:33,000
took it and she went to hell for at

1684
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:36,960
least like you know 12 hours she was in

1685
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,340
THC hell you know and and it was a

1686
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,020
negligible amount but it's just because

1687
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,640
it affected her so much she's not used

1688
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:43,800
to it and all of a sudden bam she's

1689
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,820
taking a an extracted amount even though

1690
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,520
it was small

1691
01:10:44,819 --> 01:10:49,259
it's extracted so you know yeah it's it

1692
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,940
that could happen giving this to their

1693
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:53,880
dogs people are giving this to their

1694
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:56,158
kids and they have no clue no clue that

1695
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:59,039
that can happen hey they're mixing LSD

1696
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:00,420
with with weed you know that right how

1697
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,039
are they doing that

1698
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:05,399
I was like wait a minute you can't smoke

1699
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:08,880
that I remember your story now well yeah

1700
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:11,158
um in the 1980s I there was a number of

1701
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,079
people who still believe that that

1702
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:16,619
wasn't bad when they first smoked weed

1703
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:19,260
that was kind of psychedelic and they I

1704
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:23,399
one of my Mad Jack Chronicles is about a

1705
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:25,079
Rastafarian I know in Brooklyn and he

1706
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:28,619
sent us out of his house after he had

1707
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:31,738
two Puffs of skunk number one and

1708
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:36,119
and the next day told me was very mad

1709
01:11:31,738 --> 01:11:37,799
that I had given him some LSD in and he

1710
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:41,760
had never smoked anything that powerful

1711
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:44,100
and he was a super Rastafarian and when

1712
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,100
we were gone he told us later that he

1713
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:48,539
jogged in place for 20 minutes he had so

1714
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:52,679
much energy he didn't know what to do so

1715
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:55,380
he just ran in place in his living room

1716
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:57,119
that's great I'll bet there's still some

1717
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:58,980
people out in the farm somewhere that

1718
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:00,658
believe there's LSD could be pushed oh

1719
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:02,279
yeah I mean look at the the fentanyl

1720
01:12:00,658 --> 01:12:03,658
craze lately I mean you see this with

1721
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:04,979
the the police officer saying that

1722
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:07,379
they're absorbing fentanyl through their

1723
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:09,899
fingers from powder and like passing out

1724
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:11,880
everywhere like people that know like

1725
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:13,559
you can't absorb fentanyl through your

1726
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,900
fingers unless it's got like some kind

1727
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:18,600
of transdermal jail DMSO it doesn't

1728
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:21,479
absorb that way yeah and and even being

1729
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,920
a foot away and inhaling a microscopic

1730
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:25,678
amount of powder or fentanyl isn't going

1731
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:28,079
to kill you or nor need Narcan so it's

1732
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,719
it's it's we see this today with with

1733
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:32,399
the um and granted fentanyl's dangerous

1734
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,658
as hell there's no doubt about it I mean

1735
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:35,819
people shouldn't be taking this stuff

1736
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:38,039
it's it's unregulated it's you know

1737
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:40,619
coming from China don't take it please

1738
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:43,079
people not saying you should take it but

1739
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:45,179
it's also the it's like the satanic

1740
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:46,679
Panic of the 80s to me where there are

1741
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:48,840
so much misinformations coming out with

1742
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:51,000
these drugs that people are experiencing

1743
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:53,340
these psychosomatic effects and it helps

1744
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,779
spread more fear now the cops are

1745
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:57,000
passing out they're so terrified to work

1746
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:59,399
with fentanyl and and do these fentanyl

1747
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,319
arrests they're passing out in fear and

1748
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:03,059
and blaming it on overdosing and all

1749
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:05,340
this crazy [ __ ] and it's causing more

1750
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:08,460
fear and it's just yeah fear of the

1751
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:11,000
unknown is is something the crack

1752
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:13,439
epidemic exactly it's similar yeah yeah

1753
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,238

1754
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:16,979
well

1755
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:19,019
so did you guys ever think you would be

1756
01:13:16,979 --> 01:13:21,479
pioneering an industry that became a

1757
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:23,100
multi-billion dollar industry

1758
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:24,539

we were just filling uh you know filling

1762
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:37,079
a need in a way and there's a guy who

1763
01:13:34,738 --> 01:13:40,859
lives in Costa Rica but he lived up here

1764
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:42,960
in Taos for many years and uh he started

1765

somebody dug up the guy was saying skunk

1817
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:51,119

1818
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:55,439
skunk until the 90s or something he was

1819
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:58,619
trying and I said well no

1820
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:00,599
we had it back in 1980 anyway you know

1821
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:03,960
we were yeah no did we think of course

1822
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:05,699
it wasn't gonna grow into this industry

1823
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,380
that it is now you know obviously we

1824
01:16:05,698 --> 01:16:11,279
didn't know it was going to be legal

1825
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:13,859
ever right yeah sure but um I mean it's

1826
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:16,439
just to maybe close it up I don't know

1827
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:18,238
Jim what Jim's would say but it was

1828
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:20,698
there were a couple things it was the

1829
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:23,459
adventure yeah it was the the the the

1830
01:16:20,698 --> 01:16:25,439
the the the the there's not what's the

1831
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:28,198
word tipping your nose at Authority and

1832
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:31,439
yeah yeah that that was it part of it

1833
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:33,178
you know and uh and the excellent seed

1834
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:35,219
that we had that grew this marvelous the

1835
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:37,380
skunk was one thing I've never been that

1836
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:40,920
fond of that you know I like this that's

1837
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:43,079
TiVo was a show yeah so energizing you

1838
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,840
know and and as I say we'd smoke it in

1839
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:47,880
the morning what you know we'll just be

1840
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,739
lying around or wasting a day but no you

1841
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,980
you could get out I mean I don't know if

1842
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:53,959
you could um fully operate in a job I

1843
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:57,359
said

1844
01:16:53,960 --> 01:17:00,779
smoke marijuana and be any good on a

1845
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:03,299
film set but yeah I I could certainly um

1846
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:06,000
you know run around and chasing football

1847
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:08,159

bit stoned so I've done every single one

1855

recording in you know in in my mind

1872
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:13,500
conversations that I have when I was in

1877
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:25,859
of drugs you know you should take them

1878
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,239
recreationally and enjoy it for that you

1879
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:29,819
know just like being in the pub and

1880

quite the same hangover no not for me

1885

1886
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,260
yeah no especially in that once you're

1887
01:18:44,279 --> 01:18:47,819
used to it I remember early on being

1888
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:49,860
like feeling like I was dragging a bit

1889
01:18:47,819 --> 01:18:53,399

for the evening barely able to order a

1904
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,539

01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:43,198
yeah yeah and I posted some thoughts

1930
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:45,719
about that also was that it was odd that

1931
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:49,319
they used the the front of the label

1932
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:51,420
said you know hash plants yeah if you're

1933
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:55,380
Afghan it said repeatedly on that label

1934
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:58,859
pure Afghan unhybridized I it made me

1935
01:20:55,380 --> 01:21:01,980
wonder if maybe they started with Afghan

1936
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:04,319
number one and it was before skunk

1937
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:07,019
number one or they were planning on

1938
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:09,359
releasing these labels with skunk number

1939
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:11,580
I mean with Afghan number one but people

1940
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,859
said oh no the skunk number one's way

1941
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:17,899
better way better so then they switched

1942
01:21:13,859 --> 01:21:20,639
and he he sold skunk number one

1943
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:23,460
labels printed up and then they realized

1944
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,679
oh my God we have multiple strains but

1945
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:29,698
we had these nice tables let's just use

1946
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:33,600
the label and put the F on the back yeah

1947
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:36,178
yeah and also there's there's so much

1948
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:39,719
detail that we both know

1949
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:42,420
um from like even the Jerome days when

1950
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:44,819
we were growing and we were so our first

1951
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:46,380
year we did quite well good enough so

1952
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:48,359
that we didn't have to work for two

1953
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:52,140
dollars an hour which we did the year

1954
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:55,139
before just to get by yeah and

1955
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:57,360
it also allowed me the money to buy

1956
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:59,940
three thousand skunk number one seeds

1957
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:02,099
exactly I have to say thank you to High

1958
01:21:59,939 --> 01:22:03,059
Times because that's how I found Robert

1959
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,400
Clark

1960
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:10,020
great reading some of his articles in

1961
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:12,779
there yeah and I wrote to the to the I

1962
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:13,860
wrote to him via High Times They said if

1963
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:15,779
you want to talk to the author or

1964
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:16,939
whatever and then he he wrote me

1965
01:22:15,779 --> 01:22:21,300
directly

1966
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:24,479
somehow we connected and it was um I

1967
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:27,300
realized then that by having the most

1968
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:29,759
potent most famous seed

1969
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:31,980
um at that time it would be up to our

1970
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,199
benefit oh yeah because you know what

1971
01:22:31,979 --> 01:22:35,899
had brought skunked to Arizona yet yeah

1972
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:39,779
the loan to New York City or Brooklyn

1973
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:41,879
and it turned out to be um very

1974
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:44,579
worthwhile it was so new at that point

1975
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,960
it was skunk was so new when you guys

1976
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:48,238
got hold of it you guys were some of the

1977
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:51,779
biggest first guys growing it in that in

1978
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:54,718
that size for sure yeah and we pulled it

1979
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:57,079
off so that made it even better and it

1980
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,079
made history

1981
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,440
all right guys but this is this is an

1982
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:02,819
amazing conversation

1983
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,178
um is there anything else you want to

1984
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:05,179
get in Johnny

1985
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:11,759
I'm just looking back I I you know Jim

1986
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:15,420
and I still

1987
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:17,579
still we we went buried to him you know

1988
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:20,100
when I went my way and he went his but

1989
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:22,979
it's been it was the adventure of my

1990
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:25,860
life absolutely it was and if I might

1991
01:23:22,979 --> 01:23:29,698
have had a few you know and and that was

1992
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:33,179
it was um a fabulous time and I'm always

1993
01:23:29,698 --> 01:23:35,460
grateful to Jim for um sort of mentoring

1994
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:37,460
me through it you know because so many

1995
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:40,140
people you know I've

1996
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:43,319
thousands obviously tens of thousands of

1997
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:46,320
people have grown weed um since you know

1998
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:48,859
in in dodgy spots and a lot of them fail

1999
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:52,019
you know I mean sure I I bet there's a

2000
01:23:48,859 --> 01:23:53,819
tremendous attrition rate of Australia

2001
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:57,179
you know you know everybody starts out

2002
01:23:53,819 --> 01:24:01,198
all full of enthusiasm and goes out and

2003
01:23:57,179 --> 01:24:02,699
cuts holes into Manzanita uh you know

2004
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:05,698
yeah

2005
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:08,399
um thickets and and they don't make it

2006
01:24:05,698 --> 01:24:11,219
so you know I wanted to sit just thank

2007
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:14,519
that you know Jim was the um Jim was the

2008
01:24:11,219 --> 01:24:17,039
man and and I'm really for the first

2009
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:18,900
year anyway I was just the just the

2010
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:21,119
working stiff but it was a Fabulous

2011
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:24,479
Adventure and uh and I'll never regret

2012
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:26,519
it no I mean and um and and again we've

2013
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:29,279
sort of covered it but it's nice to have

2014
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:31,800
this Vindication now all these years

2015
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:34,679
later that um you know that marijuana

2016
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,980
hasn't as as you know most of the

2017
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:40,340
Republican senators in Colorado oh it'll

2018
01:24:37,979 --> 01:24:42,299
be the death of Colorado and you know

2019
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:45,119
everybody's going to be smashing into

2020
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:47,640
each other and and sprawling out on the

2021
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:49,079
streets and you know and and the and

2022
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:51,060
what I the other thing I'd like to point

2023
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:53,300
out which is something that gets me very

2024
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:57,120
strongly I'm an American citizen now but

2025
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:59,460
you know this this this room this prison

2026
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:01,859
system that we have in this country is

2027
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:04,380
um pardon me it's a [ __ ] disaster in

2028
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:06,539
my view and the number of people that

2029
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:08,460
are languishing in jail for God knows

2030
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:10,198
how long they're sitting on the porch

2031
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:13,020
and smoking a reefer in the evening like

2032
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:16,799
anybody else has a glass scotch or a

2033
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:19,560
beer you know is absolutely and it's an

2034
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,480
indictment of the privatized

2035
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:24,060
um prison system we have in this country

2036
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:26,339
which is which is an absolute travesty

2037
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:28,920
of Justice right there with slavery to

2038
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:31,679
me uh privatize present symptoms it is

2039
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:34,560
slavery and all the and all the

2040
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:37,980
corporations these ugly corporations

2041
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:40,320
that that set up these awful prisons and

2042
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:42,178
like Jim where Jim's got a lovely place

2043
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:44,219
up in Northern New Mexico that I've

2044
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:46,500
visited in a lot right there's a little

2045
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:48,420
town called Clayton close by and it's

2046
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:50,579
classic of what sorry I don't want to go

2047
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:54,239
too much about this but you asked me and

2048
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:56,939
you know this this um this system where

2049
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:59,399
that we the taxpayer pay these

2050
01:25:56,939 --> 01:26:01,259
corporations to put people in jail and

2051
01:25:59,399 --> 01:26:03,059
they build them in these shitty run-down

2052
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:06,480
little towns like this one's Clayton

2053
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:08,400
where there's no business no you know

2054
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:10,439
it's a dying town so all the people end

2055
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:13,259
up working as guards or cooks or

2056
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:14,638
whatever anyway right and it drives the

2057
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,960
whole town and and without the

2058
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:18,179
privatized prison then you're you're

2059
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:20,460
driving the whole town out of money and

2060
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:22,920
it becomes its own problem right and the

2061
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:24,658
and the city fathers kissed the ass of

2062
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,119
the exactly I think blue running because

2063
01:26:24,658 --> 01:26:29,819
it's the only trade they've got but but

2064
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:31,698
it's driven and how many people are in

2065
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:33,719
there for non-violent crimes you know

2066
01:26:31,698 --> 01:26:37,439
victimless crimes

2067
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:39,500
the whole drug thing is it's the the DEA

2068
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,638
you know we were always joking

2069
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:44,179
half-heartedly or in a sense about

2070
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:47,520
getting caught by the DEA that that

2071
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:51,000
entire war against drugs has proved to

2072
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,159
be an absolute complete [ __ ] waste of

2073
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,520
taxpayers money billions of dollars

2074
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:58,859
wasted billions of dollars

2075
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:02,239
yeah trillions people's lives so many

2076
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:06,299
lives ruined and they still are you know

2077
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:08,698
the violence in Mexico and um and and

2078
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:12,260
it's appalling to me that we go on in

2079
01:27:08,698 --> 01:27:15,658
this country you know um

2080
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:18,300
financing this stupid fight on drugs

2081
01:27:15,658 --> 01:27:21,238
whereas you know if we at least had some

2082
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:24,000
more sensible approach and policies for

2083
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:25,158
it in America there wouldn't be the the

2084
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,139
the the

2085
01:27:25,158 --> 01:27:31,819
terrible violence on the border anyway

2086
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:34,560
that's my my only concern too is is that

2087
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:37,019
legalization only brings those [ __ ]

2088
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,880
in the corporate sector into cannabis to

2089
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:41,159
bastardize it more and ruin it from the

2090
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,900
inside out that's my biggest concern but

2091
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:44,279
it almost seems inevitable because

2092
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:45,779
that's what they do and then you just

2093
01:27:44,279 --> 01:27:49,679
take it back

2094
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:52,380
yeah you know I can at least at least

2095
