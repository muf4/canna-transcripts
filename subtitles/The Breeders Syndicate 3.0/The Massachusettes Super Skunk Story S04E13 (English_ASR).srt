00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,039

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,079

um

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,079

what what how do we want to um

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,480
label certain people

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,719
well i mean we can just call a skunk

23
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,839

85
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,958
one time some of these guys came out and

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,199

95
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,280
francine

96
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,439

about francine a little bit francine is

99
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,959
a mystery indica that uh we didn't use

100
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,959
the term at the time but it was about as

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,680
terpy as terpy gets

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,479
yeah um eventually dude dropped it

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,640
because

104
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,919
like a lot of afghans um it had a

105
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,719
horrific mold problem yeah and as you

106
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,479
know

107
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,318
you know when you uh when you grow

108
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,318

109
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,798
beautiful and horrifically mold

110
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,280
at times it's very depressing harvest

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,840
time oh yeah happened to you a few times

112
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,719
with a cut you can get ptsd

113
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,438
and

114
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,919
decide to drop it you know like

115
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,560
get people get emotional about it so

116
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,039

117
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
you know it it was a really good

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,720
combination of like that

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,918
like that afghan kind of acrid funk

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,880
yeah right

121
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:29,839
but with with like a fruity

122
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,159
aspect but not like the tropical sativa

123
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,599
kind of fruit it just had like a really

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,160
deep like

125

like foot funk fruit kind of flavor to

126
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,479
it i think oh wow

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,680
so anyway so these dudes loved it

128
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,399
yeah

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
and

130
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,079
uh

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,840
um they loved it so much they were

132
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,399
willing to trade

133
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,519
this skunk that they had for it

134
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,918
okay

135
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,918
so separately to all this story and uh

136
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,079
skunkvas kinda talked about this

137
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,359
extensively on his on his podcast so

138
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,680
i'll just briefly touch on it but

139
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,000
chem dog wouldn't give out the dog which

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,600
is what we call it to anyone right he

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
held it super tight he didn't want

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
anybody in his circle getting it he

143
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,240
didn't want to get cut off

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,720
you know um or have other people sell it

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,079
but when homie moved to

146
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,720
california

147
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,800
he agreed look i'll give it to you

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
if you just don't ever share it with

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
anybody back east

150
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,159
yeah

151
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,599
right

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,280
yeah don't want to compete markets

153
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,280
totally don't make sense

154
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,839
don't share it so

155
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,599
basically what happened is that skunkva

156
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,198
arranged with his buddies

157
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,160
to trade the francine for the skunk

158
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
okay

159
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
yeah

160
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,160
dude decided to make a double trip where

161
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,919
he would bring the francine out

162
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,600
to virginia and he would trade it for

163
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,198
the skunk and then he would drive up to

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,280
massachusetts and he would get the chem

165
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,080
dog that was promised to him right

166
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,239
dude that's committed that is committed

167
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,560
in 1993

168
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,759
uh homie drove across a bunch of shady

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,519
ass states

170

173
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,719
got pulled over he probably would have

174
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,318
had to eat them you know or something

175
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,199
yeah yeah and we have their state

176
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,680
checkpoints you gotta do all kinds of

177
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,879
you know this was actually pre-pre

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,038
uh to use a term we joke about mostly

179
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,600
the highway 80 drug checkpoints and

180
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,279
stuff like that yeah this was in 93 so

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,080
they really hadn't gotten wise to that

182
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,959
too much oh good if you took the middle

183
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,318
route uh you you were pretty much safe

184
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,399
for the most part i mean you could still

185
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,360
get pulled over you know

186
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,399
and he definitely looked like a hippie

187
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,600
i bet like he wasn't yet no secret sauce

188
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,918
or anything like that he didn't look

189
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,680
like a young republican or anything yeah

190
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:56,719
yeah and so so he drives out to

191
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,240
virginia and uh

192
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,479
and meets

193
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,960
um what we just learned actually

194
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,560
recently ended up being dude's actual

195
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,399
worker because the dude had already kind

196
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,240
of gone on the run for a bit

197
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,839
and was weaving

198
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
and so he gets this this super skunk cut

199
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,638
okay

200
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,038
and i want to interject as far as we

201
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,519
know the person we're referring to um

202
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,279
not by name the staten island guy yeah

203
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,680
that as far as we know this is

204
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,079
scumfier's mentor so this is how close

205
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
we can put skunk va to the beginning of

206
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,359
this cut as far as we know

207
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,199
the guy that agreed to do it is the

208
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,879
mentor but apparently

209
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,680
the guy that actually did the trade is

210
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,439
one of his workers exactly um but i

211
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,400
asked when all this confusion came up a

212
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,560
few years ago i read i asked

213
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,439
staten island um

214
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,598
do you remember the exchange

215
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,120
well enough to be absolutely sure what

216
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,839
did he call it

217
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
yeah

218
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,598
if you fast forward to like when i

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,079
became friends with these guys in the

220
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,240
late 90s it was always called super

221
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,359
skunk right yes

222
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,000
so

223
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,479
staten island uh he gets

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,120
you know he told me that straight up

225
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,000
dude said this is a super skunk cup

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
okay

227
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,680
so he gets it straight forward yeah so

228
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
he trades he gets it then he drives to

229
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,439
massachusetts okay and he meets up with

230
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
chemdawg

231
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,199
and he gets the 91.

232
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,359
uh we all call the dog but you know

233
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,560
everybody on the internet calls it skunk

234
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,960
[ __ ] or 91 or whatever so yeah but

235
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,639
everybody back then it was just the dog

236
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,439
a bunch of these dudes were organic

237
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,519
growers and so even though it was chem

238
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,599
dog they didn't want to put them on it

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,599
yeah my buddy they weren't super into

240
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,360
calling it chem dog because they grew

241
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,399
fully organic so

242
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,480
um so we destroyed the dog and amongst

243
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,399
all of us long before it got famous or

244
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
anything like that that's just kind of a

245
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,958
shorthand

246
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
you know i've been writing that on

247
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,879
labels now for

248
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
two decades right so

249
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,720
so

250
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,399
he got

251
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
an extra cut or two

252
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,120
of this super skunk

253
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
okay

254
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,399
okay and he gave one to chem dog

255
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,720
okay okay

256
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,958
so that's not so chem dog got it

257
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,000
basically by accident yeah he got it by

258
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:16,239
proxy just like by accident by proxy he

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,559
got it because homie decided to go to

260
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,799
virginia before massachusetts

261
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,719
that's crazy what a what a wild

262
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,359
yeah he could have reversed it and gone

263
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,839
massachusetts virginia home

264
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,720
yeah but he went virginia massachusetts

265
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,839
home

266
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
that's enough

267
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
it changed a lot

268
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,278
that act that choice in my opinion i

269
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,120
mean we've talked about this a bunch or

270
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,439
whatever that ended up

271
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,000
leading to a whole series of accidental

272
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,320
events that became super important right

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,519
right yeah so

274
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,080
um

275
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,560
you know so then he drives back home

276
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
right yep now he's got super skunk in

277
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,639
the dark

278
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,519
okay

279
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,399
and if you went to warfield shows in san

280
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,200
francisco to see jerry band you probably

281
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,600
could have seen him slinging all that

282
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
in front of the show every single month

283
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
yeah

284
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,159
yeah

285
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,160
um

286
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,079
so skunk fall took a different tact and

287
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
he could speak to this for himself but

288
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,000
he kept touring basically

289
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
right

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,399
so

291
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,959
when jerry died in august uh this next

292
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,120
week here we call this the days between

293
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,239
because jerry's birthday is on the first

294
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,839
of august and his his death is on the is

295
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,480
in a week now or something like that and

296
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,480
so these are like easter for hippies

297
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,440
yeah it's sort of like the yeah it's the

298
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,519
it's the easter week or whatever so

299
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
uh you know skunk vod decided to settle

300
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,799
down after

301
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,919
jerry passes

302
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,479
right

303
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,559
and that's when he started growing

304
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,720
now because obviously to grow you have

305
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,919
to be semi-stable it's not a really

306
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,399
dramatic lifestyle right so yeah um

307
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,240
so those pictures that he's been posting

308
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,799
of polaroids and everything like that or

309
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,560
after our buddy gave him the cut from

310
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,599
his friends in virginia and he started

311
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:08,239
growing it

312
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,320
yes right yep um so that's basically how

313
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,600
that's basically how this this cut from

314
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,160
virginia made its way to sonoma county

315
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,079
the bay and massachusetts

316
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,838
and see and then this is a great intro

317
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,958
too to the chem dog story as well which

318
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:26,160
we will cover in our podcast which

319
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,679
will eventually be here soon soon so

320
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,879
so that's the start of that's the start

321
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,559
of the super skunk movie um

322
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,519
you know i uh

323
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,958
i met uh i didn't know them then

324
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:43,278
personally uh a couple years after that

325
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:46,479
um and uh my you know my uh my buddy

326
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,399
uh he fell in love with the mendo p

327
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
yeah a couple other things or whatever

328
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,360
and so he ended up giving me the super

329
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,240
skunk and the dog for safekeeping

330
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
you know

331
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,480
and uh and that's in the late 90s and

332
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,639
that's kind of how i got it

333
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,079
and you've had it

334
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,919
well like not the super skunk but the

335
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,159
chem 91 and it stayed with you ever

336
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,439
since yep i've had that since i never

337
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,799
lost it no

338
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,760
unfortunately

339
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,199
the super skunk was lost uh but we'll

340
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,759
get to that

341
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,959
yeah okay so you know so we have this

342
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,480
stuff right

343
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,799
and uh

344
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,240
you know this is obviously

345
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,439
um

346
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,240
what is it

347
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,240
you know so late 90s 2000 2001 this

348
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,079
whole little era right then so you've

349
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,680
got like the internet is in it's like

350
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:36,319
infancy essentially right overgrow had

351
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,159
just began in 98.

352
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,278
yeah

353
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,120
so there really wasn't any internet fame

354
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,600
yeah right all these things that have

355
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,799
become super famous and like holy grails

356
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,480
and all these people trying to figure

357
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,759
out stuff right

358
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,800
uh

359
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,958
most of the stories that i believe

360
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,958
that i've heard about this stuff comes

361
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,958
from that era

362
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,078
because that was when there was nobody

363
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,078
gave a [ __ ]

364
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,759
yeah in the sense so there's no reason

365
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,759
to bull about any of it there was no

366
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,958
fame associated with it there was no rap

367
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,799
there was no

368
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,278
i mean it was literally like

369
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:15,278
there was like four people in california

370
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,039
who had it yeah exactly there was me

371
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,480
skunk

372
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,159
our buddy

373
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,639
and uh uh i see collective yes i see

374
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,679
collective yes right that's right who

375
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,720
was really close friends with skunk bar

376
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,679
you know uh yeah and and greg and that

377
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,680
and he

378
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,759
and he ended up like moving in with

379
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,838
skunkva and that's how he got the cut so

380
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,278
there was literally like four of us

381
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,120
yeah um so not very big and now back

382
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,559
then you had enormous rooms or anything

383
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,078
like that you know

384
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,679
yeah literally wasn't very much of it

385
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,120
even being produced

386
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,439
yeah you're blowing it up with the four

387
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,399
lighter essentially you're blowing it

388
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,000
mostly

389
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,720
mostly

390
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,120
eight six spiders okay

391
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,160
you guys are slinging hard

392
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,078
twelve lighters or whatever but yeah um

393
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,159
but yeah you know and so

394
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,759
uh so just to keep it back on the super

395
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,958
skunk tip

396
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,078
um

397
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,039
you know

398
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:16,239
obviously it's been quite a long time

399
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,599
um but here here's what i know for sure

400
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,039
um

401
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
it was uh

402
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,639
i never ever heard it called anything

403
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,759
but super skunk

404
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,519
um

405
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,480
obviously we've had some debate amongst

406
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,240
friends

407
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,000
oh sure there's a whole different thing

408
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
we can get into later about whatever

409
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,519
about some different

410
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,360
different names and stuff and yeah there

411
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,278
may not be the exact same thing through

412
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,079
different crews or whatever but as far

413
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,039
as as far as my little group goes

414
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:44,879
um

415
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,599
that's what it was always called

416
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,399
right straight super skunk and so buddy

417
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,839
from staten island okay

418
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,278
he would love like when we'd have

419
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,120
trimmers over

420
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,240
you could pull side branches of that

421
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,560
thing and you could hold it up to the

422
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
the picture in the catalog of the 90

423
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,479
seed bank

424
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,399
right

425
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,278
then it was like a dead ringer

426
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,559
yeah you would you could find buds on

427
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,600
the plants

428
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,838
that like match that look exactly

429
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,680
yeah it was very very uniform witnessed

430
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,800
him dozens of times over multiple crops

431
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,479
right

432
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,439
just because he was just so cool because

433
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,199
it's like yeah exactly like the picture

434
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,720
in the catalog right

435
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,719
yeah and he could show you hey this

436
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
really is super skunk you're buying you

437
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,519
know and so

438
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,439
uh you know in a lot of ways you know it

439
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,600
was a sketchy plan

440
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,199
um

441
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,519
that was you know that was the very

442
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,519
beginning of the 215 era

443
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,919
right um but it wasn't really you know

444
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,560
215 had like multiple eras right the

445
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,799
first five or six 215

446
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,278
like the cops the courts everything it

447
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,039
was still pretty much underground yeah

448
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,958
yeah you're still getting [ __ ] people

449
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,360
hadn't grown to like let's have a

450
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,000
greenhouse outside my back door you know

451
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,919
yeah none of that thrilling uh indoor

452
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,839
was still sketchy it was still not the

453
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,799
jam you know yeah

454
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,000
so

455
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,758
um so the super skunk

456
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
you know the last two or three weeks it

457
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,800
literally people joke about carbon

458
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,440
filter killer right yeah it was the only

459
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,919
strain i've ever grown that um

460
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,750
absolutely defeated every opportunity i

461
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,039
ever had to win

462
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,399
[Laughter]

463
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,240
i don't even know any other way to

464
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,919
describe it the amount yeah burn it

465
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,320
would give me like i would pull up with

466
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,278
two weeks to go in front of my house in

467
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,278
summer

468
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,639
and it would smell like a dead skunk in

469
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,958
my driveway

470
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,680
yeah i know the feeling not with skunks

471
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,518
but yeah every direction and and so you

472
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,120
know back then you're just like oh my

473
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,919
god you know that is yeah be

474
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,240
nerve-wracking and so

475
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,078
at which i had obviously people know on

476
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,639
this on this thing what scrubbers are i

477
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,638
had a a co2 scrubber with a fan

478
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,440
scrubbing the room

479
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,879
i had uh or a carbon filter sorry not

480
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,038
co2 i had a carbon filter right yeah and

481
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,599
um so that's scrubbing the room and then

482
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,838
i had a carbon filter on the exhaust

483
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,279
and then i had one of those huge uv on

484
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,038
air double

485
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,399
uh yeah um

486
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:20,078
you know ozone generators yes even did

487
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,600
the recommended 25 or 30 feet of tubing

488
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,438
before it went out the building to make

489
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,078
sure it had time to mix

490
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,440
yeah and it still smelled like i was

491
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,200
slaughtering skunks in my backyard

492
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,480
i mean

493
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,120
that's kind of how it was you know so

494
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,000
uh it was trippy in that regard

495
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:42,798
um and you know it

496
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,798
it was it was i don't know it looked

497
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,639
dense

498
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,798
even when it looked dense it was still

499
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
it still weighed light

500
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,720
yeah it was just one of those things

501
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,679
where like you you know you put a nug on

502
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,919
there and you're like oh this is going

503
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,240
to be impressive and you're like oh

504
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,559
no it's hollow how did they make hollow

505
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,319
weed so it was like solid but it was

506
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,599
fluffy it's like almost like ice cream

507
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,759
or something that had a bunch of air

508
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,199
whipped into it you know

509
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,160
and uh

510
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,279
um

511
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
you know and

512
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,918
the terp the weird thing about the terp

513
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,319
is that it was super volatile in my

514
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,080
opinion like it didn't really stink

515
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,240
until the last bit

516
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,399
and then it dunked for about a month or

517
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,000
five weeks after you cut it

518
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,559
yeah if you let super skunk go too long

519
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,480
in your jar or whatever it would have

520
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,399
eventually kind of smelling semi to

521
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,798
generic green butter

522
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,038
oh yes yeah that makes sense would go

523
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,519
from like i could crack a jar in the

524
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,720
other room and someone would walk in and

525
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,960
ask me what was going on like you would

526
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,839
have to like crunch the [ __ ] out of it

527
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,480
and deeply smell to try to get a whiff

528
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,599
yeah that makes sense but fresh

529
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
it reaped

530
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,240
yeah

531
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,919
um

532
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,558
you know and you know it's kind of hard

533
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,080
to trim it was it could be sparse you

534
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,798
know when it didn't

535
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,079
uh you know i mean for most people

536
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,759
um

537
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,480
probably the easiest way to think about

538
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,759
it

539
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,558
is uh you know real old-school sour has

540
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,240
a lot of similarities to it yes you know

541
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,440
so when sour doesn't want to come out

542
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,120
the right way

543
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,919
it's a [ __ ] to trim you know like

544
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,918
people lose people start you know your

545
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,240
your crew gets disheartened

546
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,480
oh my god i got a trim diesel you know

547
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,558
yeah right now i posted some stuff for

548
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,519
you the other night uh that i sent you

549
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:34,639
where like my old sour diesel cutting

550
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,879
it looks like those tops those colas

551
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,038
they really oh yeah see

552
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,760
those same super skunk

553
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,839
tops that skunk posts

554
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,200
yeah you can really see the similarity

555
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,918
in it you know

556
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,519
um so the other thing that that uh so it

557
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,160
had unbelievable terps i mean when

558
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,679
people talk about rks terps or whatever

559
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,279
else it was

560
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,038
the terpest

561
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,079
skunkiest rankest thing imaginable

562
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,798
you know

563
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,879
uh it really was um

564
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,158
and uh you know

565
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,919
it also you know uh it also hurt like a

566
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,000
[ __ ]

567
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,000
yeah that's that's like really the the

568
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,240
first thing i ever heard about mass

569
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
super when i first started getting into

570
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,240
the scene and learning the history and

571
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,880
stuff that that [ __ ] was a herm bomb it

572
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,599
was a herm bomb it could harm um you

573
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,559
know we would pull it about eight weeks

574
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,480
sometimes

575
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,079
you would um

576
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,440
you know you would try to take it longer

577
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,439
because you think maybe it needed to be

578
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,279
done more

579
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
and they would herm for sure

580
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,158
yeah

581
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,600
but the other thing is and this is kind

582
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,799
of weird about it

583
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,839
is that it hurt early too

584
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:47,119
because

585
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:49,678
well as a breeder right yeah

586
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,319
yeah if you let's say you pull the super

587
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,360
skunk at 58 days

588
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,918
and you find tiger striped beans in it

589
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,798
yeah when were those beans made yeah you

590
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,240
know they're

591
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,038
early on

592
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,798
probably primarily

593
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:05,679
because it takes a good four to six

594
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,240
weeks

595
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,400
yes premature to like fully mature and

596
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,558
get that dark tiger striping that looks

597
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,880
all healthy and stuff you know sure um

598
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,480
so you pull a strain at 58 days just by

599
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,480
the law of

600
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,640
how beans grow

601
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,919
yeah had the pot you know it something

602
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,120
bad bad had to happen in three weeks

603
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,559
yeah

604
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,239
yeah but that act that in my opinion you

605
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,399
know and there's a certain amount of you

606
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,000
know we can get to opinions about it but

607
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
that factor

608
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,480
created a whole bunch of weed that we

609
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,639
like

610
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,480
yeah i did that's that's the crazy part

611
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,919
craziest part about all of it through

612
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
live harms

613
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,520
yeah

614
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,798
and so okay so you know in the in the uh

615
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,759
you know uh

616
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,480
the the buddy from staten island right

617
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,599
he was not very into sharing

618
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,640
yeah no

619
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,839
um i uh you know when i got when i got

620
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
the dog

621
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,798
i had to promise that i wouldn't give it

622
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,480
out you know which i didn't for forever

623
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,918
you know yeah and i would have like we

624
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,558
would have like really good friends of

625
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,038
ours that would um

626
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,960
beg me for it and i'd be like you know

627
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,640
who you have to talk to

628
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
get him to call me and say that you can

629
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
have it and i'll take cuts for you

630
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,960
tomorrow

631
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,360
yeah but otherwise like i'm not breaking

632
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,880
my word yeah of course because like

633
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,119
we're all good friends and he's gonna

634
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,679
know you have it and then that makes me

635
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,038
look like an [ __ ] you know so no you

636
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,880
know

637
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,960
issues and it's like well this is the

638
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,720
you know this is what i had to do so he

639
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,120
wasn't as strict about the skunk but he

640
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,839
kind of felt the same way you know and

641
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,759
you know me like i try to be as like

642
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,319
as etiquette

643
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,240
as oh yeah possible with cuts yeah i

644
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,240
don't even like to pressure people i'm

645
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,640
just not into it like yeah have their

646
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,880
own vibe and their own energy about why

647
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,440
they come to you or not you know sure

648
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,760
and so you know so

649
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,798
what sucks about that

650
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,879
is that we didn't spread it very far

651
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,839
yeah right like we weren't on forums or

652
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,159
anything like that or whatever

653
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,759
um staten island buddy is not weasel

654
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,559
clop glass no

655
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,158
no no he's not uh i'm not paying very

656
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,319
much attention to the words at the

657
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,320
bottom of the screen so it's alright as

658
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,399
anything maybe mac can say it or repeat

659
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:26,319
it again or something but yeah he's

660
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,480
totally not it's totally not him um

661
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,038
so uh you know

662
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,798
so the fact there's two things right is

663
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,558
obviously back then most people are

664
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:35,599
growing for profit you know on some

665
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,519
level

666
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,000
and so having a cut that wreaks the high

667
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,480
heaven and scares your neighbors

668
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,880
and herms on you

669
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,319
uh you know it made it dicey on people

670
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,080
holding it

671
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,639
yeah and so

672
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,599
you know we never you know skunk bon

673
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,360
myself you know our buddy we never

674
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,759
really spread it we weren't trading we

675
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,918
weren't active on the forums you know we

676
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,919
weren't swapping cuts out right and left

677
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,799
and stuff and so

678
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,120
you know

679
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,879
uh that's uh you know that's a different

680
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,000
discussion but as you know like every

681
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,080
time

682
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,720
my opinion is is like every single time

683
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,879
a famous named cut happened

684
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,079
yeah like purple craze with urkel and

685
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
gdp

686
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,399
the sour the cushions whatever

687
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
a whole bunch of amazing diversity just

688
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,000
goes to [ __ ]

689
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,599
yeah because people want to fill their

690
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,359
room or their greenhouse or their

691
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,439
whatever with something that some guy is

692
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,240
going to come and snap it from them

693
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,159
right

694
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,480
yeah they they want the the ship that's

695
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,799
gonna sell not for the most so even

696
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,319
amongst most of my close friends i've

697
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,720
always had a [ __ ] of a time getting

698
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,439
people to back things up for me

699
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,240
yeah people want one or two plants that

700
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,840
they're currently doing for production

701
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,679
and they don't hold on to a bunch of

702
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,158
stuff that they're doing for safe

703
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,960
keeping or heads or whatever you know

704
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,278
yeah

705
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,200
um so it wasn't that easy for me to get

706
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,159
it to be backed up anywhere

707
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,038
right

708
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,799
particularly because uh you know when it

709
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,879
comes to you know production and stuff

710
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,558
like that some broker finding seeds is

711
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,480
[ __ ] doomed

712
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,000
um so like hey do you want to grow this

713
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,120
thing that could potentially lightly or

714
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,119
heavily seed your room

715
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,240
no not at all not not really no right

716
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,679
you know

717
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,200
so

718
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,559
you know i mean

719
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,558
uh

720
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,879
so we all grew it

721
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,879
um and sorry i'm sorry i just had to

722
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,440
boot someone i didn't want to but he was

723
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,520
being a jackass and being real rude so

724
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,400
oh i have no i i wasn't even paying

725
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,038
attention it's all good it's bad

726
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,600
um so i don't know i mean that's kind of

727
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,119
the start of the of the cali

728
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,199
super skunk

729
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,639

little crew

731
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,400

i have no idea like you know what

745
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,918
happened with chem dog in massachusetts

746
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,640
you know who when how he shared what

747
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,600
with you know all that type of stuff

748
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
um

749
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,839
you know as far as this as far as the

750
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,879
actual super skunk cut goes

751
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,639
yeah

752
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,240
you know but it's one of those things

753
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,559
where like

754
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,599
you know uh nobody wanted it until it

755
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,319
became

756
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,079
sort of this legendary famous thing and

757
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,599
then everybody started poking around

758
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,319
trying to figure out who might have kept

759
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,759
it

760
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,960
you know

761
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,879
so yeah uh staten island and i

762
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,798
um we had this thing where like two of

763
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,600
our favorite strains were obviously the

764
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,278
super skunk and the chem dog right yeah

765
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,839
and the

766
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,200
super skunk had the the lime green and

767
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,359
the frost

768
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,798
uh i mean you know from the chem du you

769
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,959
know from dog

770
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,519
dog isn't particularly gorgeous

771
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,000
it's not super frosty compared to

772
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,400
grains it's darker cut you know it

773
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,038
cannibalizes its own leaves it doesn't

774
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,720
even always taste great you know yeah

775
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,960
sometimes it can taste amazing and i

776
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,960
love the flavor but like i could grow it

777
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,759
all year long and only two crops out of

778
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,480
five be happy with its flavor at times

779
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,200
yeah you know and why exactly

780
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,640
um why why exactly that is i don't know

781
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,600
so we had this idea um and this is long

782
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,120
before

783
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,359
you know i mean there was no real

784
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,959
american seed companies or anything like

785
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,240
that right so

786
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,600
we were we were doing a bunch of

787
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,278
breeding but we were doing a bunch of

788
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,879
breeding that was literally for our

789
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,798
taste buds

790
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,480
like it was not for public consumption

791
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,759
at best it was going to be grown by us

792
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,319
and spread out

793
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,798
yeah you know we created this we created

794
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:57,678
this thing over time uh staten island

795
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,200
started it and i came on and helped uh

796
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,960
and you know we did some work on it

797
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,319
together uh that we eventually called

798
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,079
the super dog

799
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,119
uh which is in the can of bible the

800
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,199
second one i think yes

801
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,759
that was my first that was my first

802
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,600
experience with kind of

803
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,079
uh

804
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,278
really finding a strain that i wanted to

805
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,319
hunt

806
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,079
right there

807
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,319
even though i got along quite well with

808
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,639
jason who wrote it um and i gave him a

809
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,278
bunch of accurate information a lot of

810
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,080
that got twisted and turned

811
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,919
into some of his entries about the the

812
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,839
dog and the chem dog and the super

813
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,640
saiyan all that type of stuff you know

814
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,639
so

815
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,799
be that as it may what we were trying to

816
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,520
do is we were trying to

817
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,720
combine the terps and the look of super

818
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,440
skunk

819
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,480
with the potency and some of the density

820
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,960
and some of the the niceness of the dog

821
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,079
sure you know and it was like a you know

822
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,440
and so

823
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,038
um

824
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,880
you know and strangely

825
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,558
uh and this is another thing of why i

826
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,559
think maybe it disappeared as we we've

827
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,558
talked about this recently too

828
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:06,558
i i tend to believe

829
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:09,678
that the skunk and the herm is related

830
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:12,558
yes like i i can't say for certain but i

831
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,320
think it might be a linked trait i i and

832
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,599
there's a lot of uh

833
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,519
um

834
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,839
evidence for that yeah you know and as

835
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,558
you know um you know there's there's

836
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,959
very few traits that people breeding

837
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,678
have you know more prejudice against

838
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,919
than uh banana banana sacks with

839
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,159
hermione you know yeah

840
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,080
and so i think inadvertently

841
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,320
uh people bred away from the skunk

842
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,839
yeah without realizing it because

843
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,839
you know you breed some stuff it's a

844
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,278
hermit mess it reeks you're like oh god

845
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,038
that's a hermit mess i'm gonna get you

846
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:45,919
know i'm not gonna breed towards that

847
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:46,640
side

848
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,399
and

849
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,640
the idea that you could have a linked

850
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,599
trait where you have a very desirable

851
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,720
trait and a not so desirable trait uh

852
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,678
together

853
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,919
you know

854
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,080
is the biggest breeder pain in the ass

855
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,000
ever is a link trait with undesirable

856
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,839
traits he's like oh all the potency

857
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,640
comes in these low yielding ones that

858
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,439
suck

859
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,240
you know

860
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,840
all these

861
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,319
huge donkey dicks and like have the

862
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,199
structures incredible they're all bland

863
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,439
you know

864
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679
yep and so

865
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,679
you know uh the problem is

866
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,759
is that you know you have a situation

867
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,360
it's like it's kind of the same thing

868
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,879
like you know like i told you about with

869
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,639
the trinity right where the trinity

870
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,760
didn't spread very far

871
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,679
and so

872
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,798
when we lost it and i kept trying to get

873
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,880
it back

874
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,158
um people would give me fakes

875
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,840
yeah

876
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,799
it's not because they were dicks most of

877
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,398
the time

878
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,240
but because they never had it back in

879
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,319
the day so when they got it from someone

880
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,759
they didn't they had no way of knowing

881
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,158
that it wasn't it

882
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,079
yeah of course yeah um and so then i

883
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,480
would have to be the bearer of bad news

884
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,720
you know and be like no this isn't it

885
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,399
yeah and people hate the bear bad news

886
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,720
and that's kind of what's happened with

887
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,798
this super skunk right is that yeah

888
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,919
there's obviously this desire in the

889
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,158
community

890
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,080
to have these these roadkill terps come

891
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,399
back right

892
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,839
everyone who finds super skunk

893
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:10,558
has a current seed company and is making

894
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,558
seeds to sold to the public

895
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:13,599
no one ever shows up

896
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,038
to

897
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:19,359
events with a couple jars of fresh skunk

898
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,440
and lets the proof be in the pudding

899
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,199
yeah right they get the cut they

900
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,080
advertise the cut here's the cut we're

901
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,798
breeding with the cut buy my seeds find

902
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,558
the amazing terps in the cup right

903
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,879
or they get kinks

904
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,839
you know yeah and so so you don't know

905
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,320
you don't know if if they're lying

906
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,480
because i don't know or whatever or

907
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,158
they just have no id they just never had

908
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,640
it in the past

909
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,760
you know to know that to know what skunk

910
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,559

skunk cut is you know

912

and so you know by the early to mid

913
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,080
2000s it had been dropped enough

914
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,960
um that uh you know

915
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:03,359
uh various people had lost it through

916
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,360
you know lots of the same reasons that

917
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,558
everybody loses cuts

918
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,639
fires busts accidents breakups

they refused to give it back to me at

922
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,440
one point uh and then lost it in the

923
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,600
future and

924
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,360

that you have people that like okay so

948
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,839

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,600
right

950
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:23,599
well then as soon as that dude verifies

951
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,678
right yeah well then all of a sudden

952
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,359
okay we have it now we can trade bait it

953
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,278
now we can get spread out now this

954
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,519
person has the cut and

955
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:34,159
you know that's the problem and that's

956
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,399
the problem you know and so

957
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,640
you know i mean before everybody who's

958
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,918
listening holy [ __ ] we're up to 242

959
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,759
people on this thing

960
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,559
but uh yeah

961
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,879
the super skunk was not a perfect cut

962
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:49,200
you know like it wasn't in my opinion it

963
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,640
wasn't the holy grail did it have

964
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,159
crazy rare skunk terps absolutely it had

965
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,038
that baits was it enjoyable to smoke

966
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240
sure

967
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,558
right

968
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,079
i don't think it held a candle to the

969
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,558
dog the d

970
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,398
some of the cushes a lot of the modern

971
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,320
cuts right now that we would consider to

972
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,398
be elite you know

973
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,639
you would consider it to have

974
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,679
moderate potency at best

975
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,480
yes

976
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,960
you know it wasn't it you know i mean

977
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,559
you know various cuts have various uh

978
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,639
qualities and

979
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,279
and other things and you know and so it

980
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,519
didn't check all the boxes

981
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,240
yeah was it a great cut sure was it

982
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:33,039
worth having yes uh was it a pain in the

983
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,759
ass to grow at times

984
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,480
your yes

985
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,879
yes think about but you know and you

986
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,918
know i mean in

987
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,279
i think you know i mean obviously

988
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,679
you know all of

989
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,399
uh chem dogs early breedings were all

990
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,358
accidental

991
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,358
right

992
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,039
yeah you know that as far as we know

993
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,480
that's the correct yeah but he was well

994
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,239
i mean the thing is that nobody was

995
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,800
reversing back then

996
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,039

seeds back then and so you only you know

999
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,239

00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,719
weed ever

1004
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,639
yeah you know uh yeah

1005
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,480
in many people's opinion

00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,400
yeah and you know i mean that's that's

1007

steps on toes or doesn't to talk about

1010
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,519
all those kind of theories about various

1011
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
things but

1012
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,599
um

1013
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,599
i have not seen the real super skunk

1014
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:40,960
um since i i lost it um which has been

1015
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,039
you know uh quite a while at this point

1016
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,280
yeah we've been hunting it for a long

1017
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,719
time um

1018
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,400
you know i

1019
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,719
i don't think it exists

1020
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,720
you know

1021
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,119
there there's always the possibility

1022
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,199
there are still pockets in america

1023
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,119
where um you know people aren't really

1024
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,519
connected they're not on the internet

1025
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,720
they're not dialed in to like the scene

1026
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,880
so to speak

1027
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,239
so yeah i mean obviously just like we

1028
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,119
know right so

1029
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:11,919
to jump on a european trip

1030
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,519
everybody thought the a52 was lost for

1031
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,320
well over a decade

1032
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,119
yeah

1033
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,720
right

1034
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,480
yeah at least yeah

1035
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,879
nobody could find it

1036
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,559
and then karma found a guy

1037
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,240
that was holding on to this cut for

1038
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,799
neville

1039
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,959
neville told him not to tell anybody

1040
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,039
and it was the a52

1041
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,880
yeah and karma wasn't even sure what he

1042
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,159
had right so he had to give it to

1043
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,480
yosemite

1044
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,519
uh who he grew with neville forever to

1045
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,719
grow it out and confirm it was it

1046
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,800
so it's possible right it is absolutely

1047
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,358
possible and i i think we are all

1048
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,599
desperately hoping that happens too no

1049
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,759
yeah it's possible that that could exist

1050
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,720
because the a5 was lost

1051
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,800
for a long time i mean a short period of

1052
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,879
time that it was lost i mean i i think

1053
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,960
it's i think it got lost in the

1054
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,519
switzerland raids

1055
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,320
um when they shut down shanti and those

1056
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,079
different

1057
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,760
and stuff and it got lost in holland

1058
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,400
during the bust eras

1059
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,320
and

1060
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,320
then it was lost for

1061
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,000
you know 10 12

1062
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,838
14 years

1063
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,760
something like that until it just popped

1064
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,599
up within the last few

1065
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,839
last few and now

1066
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,240
losing friends fast over it everybody's

1067
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,000
[ __ ] arguing over it real fast

1068
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,159
i mean yeah it's cool that we that

1069
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,639
people are still fighting over over

1070
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,480
cannabis made in the late 80s

1071
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,039
i know right

1072
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,719
to how good it is and you know it's also

1073
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,000
not only is a testament to how good it

1074
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,078
is but like people want to make money

1075
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,559
off it too some some people so

1076
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,800
if you've got rare and and you've got

1077
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,480
rare access and you can bring some

1078
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,880
things you know you're you're you're a

1079
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,358
breeder who operates in the market so if

1080
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,440
you've got something nobody else does

1081
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,319
and you can hype it and it's worthy and

1082
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,159
you can

1083
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,640
you know i mean that's what all these

1084
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:00,319
super scum people are trying to do right

1085
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,679
right exactly what's going on yeah they

1086
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,359
make they're trying to make a bunch of

1087
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,039
money before people realize they don't

1088
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,119
have what they have

1089
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,639
correct and that's that's the jam you

1090
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,358
know a lot of people want to sell seeds

1091
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,799
or pass cuts or do this and that and

1092
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:15,440
you've got a good

1093
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,000
at minimum four months three months

1094
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,000
before you're going to get any kind of

1095
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,119
pushback now the other problem is that

1096
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,199
i've noticed

1097
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,240
when people either invest in buying that

1098
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,759
cut or they've invested um emotionally

1099
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,118
in that cut at that point now they think

1100
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,720
they've got

1101
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,240
a really rare cut that's going to you

1102
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,598
know bring some kind of value to their

1103
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,959
life however they see fit and um

1104
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,519
they're now

1105
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,199
in that mindset where this is it if it's

1106
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:42,960
not yet i don't have

1107
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,480
whatever agenda

1108
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,000
purpose that i have like i was saying

1109
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,599
with the trinity people would get butt

1110
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,079
hurt at me sometimes when i would be

1111
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,838
like politely that's not it

1112
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,079
and they would do a whole thing and you

1113
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,480
don't know what i traded to get it and

1114
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,480
da da da da da and i'd be like well you

1115
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,480
know i'm sorry about all that like i

1116
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,960
have nothing to do with any of that but

1117
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,838
yeah remains to be seen it's still not

1118
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,240
it

1119
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,358
it just isn't it you know

1120
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,598
and so

1121
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,639
you know uh it's gotten to a point where

1122
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,960
there's a narrow group of people who had

1123
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,000
super skunk it

1124
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,440
you know

1125
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,239
and some of them had longer

1126
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,599
relationships with it than others

1127
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,159
and so some of them are a little bit

1128
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,838
better at identifying than others

1129
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,879
yes exactly

1130
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:28,559
you know

1131
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,559
yeah without

1132
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,320
naming names or stepping on toes or

1133
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,320
doing anything like that you know and

1134
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,440
we've had issues in the past in the

1135
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,838
community

1136
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,200
with people that you know are you know

1137
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:43,920
well thought of or respected that verify

1138
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,039
yes then once it's verified

1139
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,280
right

1140
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,920
well that's all that's all she wrote

1141
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,720
that's it it's verified you know

1142
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,400
and then you know i you know i hit up

1143
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,159
you know skunk bar or something and i'll

1144
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,240
be like what about that verified cut

1145
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,480
he's like it's not

1146
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,199
it absolutely isn't it i don't know if

1147
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,318
they ever had it if they think that's it

1148
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,318
yes right and so you know like if he

1149
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,400
tells me if he hits me up and he tells

1150
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,838
me i think i found it

1151
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,480
i'm gonna get excited

1152
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,719
yeah absolutely because he's i i tend to

1153
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,679
think him above everyone else is gonna

1154
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,039
know that cut really really intimately

1155
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,118
being that it came from his mentor and

1156
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,440
he worked with it for so long

1157
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,318
i mean you know the the fact the fact

1158
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,720
remains is that him our buddy and myself

1159
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:33,679
we cropped it quite a bit

1160
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,439
for three years so you do that you do

1161
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,199
crop after crop after crop for that a

1162
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,599
bit you run anything for a number of

1163
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,519
years is your is your main squeeze

1164
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,240
you know you learn a lot about it

1165
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,599
absolutely uh when my buddy and i were i

1166
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,639
mean that's the thing too and you know

1167
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,440
we've talked about this before is that

1168
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,639
since we bred with it a bunch

1169
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,400
i got to see

1170
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,719
you know that's one of the things that i

1171
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,039
really respect about you know uh say

1172
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:03,358
like uh csi or archive who i see on here

1173
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:04,719
you know um where there's only so many

1174
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,400
breeders

1175
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,759
out there right now that actually tests

1176
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,480
their own gear

1177
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,440
sure so don't test your own gear

1178
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,960
you don't really know what uh

1179
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,039
you don't really know what traits your

1180
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,240
clones pass yeah you're never gonna see

1181
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,079
it firsthand never you don't see what

1182
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,679
how they breed did they breed clean do

1183
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,079
they breed a mess did they throw

1184
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:30,480
consistent phenotypes do they you know

1185
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,599
growing a bunch of growing a bunch of um

1186
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,440
uh

1187
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,200
oh man uh

1188
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,079
truth man someone's asking about truth

1189
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,559
band

1190
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,880
yeah that's that's a horrible subject so

1191
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,000
um but uh

1192
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,519
um

1193
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,800
yeah you know but

1194
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:49,440
so we grew us you know buddy from staten

1195
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,960
island and myself we grew out hundreds

1196
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,599
of you know uh dog and and skunk and

1197
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,838
other various skunk hybrids you know

1198
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,760
and um and we saw what it passed

1199
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:02,559
you know you see what it throws out you

1200
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,760
know

1201
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:08,559
and so a lot of the the various like

1202
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,079
semi-proven semi-unproven theories i

1203
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,759
have about certain things we've talked

1204
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,000
about a bunch

1205
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,960
on my observation of like not very many

1206
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,039
people

1207
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,880
like have had both parents

1208
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,960
yeah

1209
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,680
my buddy myself we're like literally in

1210
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,559
like a handful of people

1211
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:29,118
um that probably had both

1212
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:32,159
yeah and we're familiar with both

1213
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,519
yes so and all that and so

1214
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,078
um

1215
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,920
you know uh

1216
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,280
i mean

1217
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,358
you know uh

1218
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,200
the the skunk definitely seemed to be

1219
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,799
connected to herms

1220
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,399
yeah the

1221
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,880
you know when we were doing the the

1222
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,559
super dog stuff if we bred away from the

1223
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,559
herms we brought away from some of the

1224
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,400
stuff we liked

1225
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,119
so then the trick was to try to find

1226
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,000
like

1227
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,880
a minimal or acceptable amount of herms

1228
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,920
yeah

1229
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,680
or

1230
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,720
okay like say take the chem d for

1231
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,279
instance

1232
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:07,039
yes md herms like crazy

1233
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,440
at times if it gets a little test

1234
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,519
especially in depth sure you know not as

1235
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,200
much as indoor but in depth certainly or

1236
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,280
if it gets a little stressed

1237
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,199
sure but it's not live pollen

1238
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,440
yeah it's not it's not it's sterile it

1239
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,480
throws bananas but there's not really

1240
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,079
live pollen in those bananas you know um

1241
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,199
so then you're looking for you're

1242
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,359
looking for

1243
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,598
you know one throws herms and has the

1244
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,880
stink but doesn't have the danger

1245
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,318
inherent

1246
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,119
in um

1247
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,358
in all that you know yeah

1248
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,119
it was a long and an expensive breeding

1249
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,318
project uh

1250
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,240
because back then uh you know obviously

1251
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:45,440
herb went for a lot more and it was a

1252
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,239
lot riskier

1253
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,280
um so anytime you dedicated rooms or

1254
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:50,879
areas

1255
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,200
to constant breeding that could have

1256
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,559
been just some kind of production run

1257
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,919
and then you're not even selling the

1258
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,119
beans they're just for you and your

1259
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,079
friends

1260
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,160
um

1261
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,920
you know but uh

1262
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,759
but you know we had we always had dual

1263
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,800
stuff like we always had this goal of

1264
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,880
trying to like

1265
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,560
you know improve the gene pool a little

1266
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,800
bit you know

1267
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,119
create more weed that we liked

1268
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,119
and so now it's like most most people's

1269
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,559
breeding is like take two famous things

1270
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,800
that people want

1271
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,759
mash them together and then sell the

1272
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,680
name

1273
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,000
yeah right where it's like

1274
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,719
we were like okay like we we like the

1275
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,838
skunk smell and we like the color and we

1276
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,598
like the

1277
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,639
the you know the quickness and all that

1278
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,200
can we marry that to the dog's potency

1279
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:38,078
and feeling and warm happy buzz and all

1280
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,559
that is there some hybrid that we can

1281
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,680
create that marries those two things

1282
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,759
together

1283
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,199
sure and so that's obviously the classic

1284
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,119
way to breed is you look at two

1285
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,439
different things and you're like i want

1286
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,200
traits from this and traits from this to

1287
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,960
end up in its progeny

1288
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,279
yeah right

1289
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,960
you know and uh so that's that's really

1290
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,000
the gig so

1291
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,240
um

1292
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,039
you know it uh

1293
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,959
you know sadly it seems like a bunch of

1294
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,800
the stuff that got passed it got passed

1295
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,720
around in massachusetts quite a bit more

1296
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,240
but it seems like from what we've been

1297
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,719
able to determine

1298
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:18,399
that it uh

1299
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:20,318
maybe it the actual cut itself wasn't

1300
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,200
passed around nearly as much as people

1301
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,800
think

1302
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:26,639
maybe in that one maybe bag seed maybe

1303
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,318
something different got passed out and

1304
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,960
it got called super skunk and it was

1305
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:32,639
from said dude

1306
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,400
so of course it's it

1307
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,719
and then you're off to the races and

1308
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,838
then that thing gets spread around and

1309
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:39,679
then the more

1310
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,519
you know i mean we've we talked about

1311
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,078
this before too but like

1312
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,800
you know rez calling his [ __ ] line

1313
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,800
sour diesel

1314
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,200
and then makes a [ __ ] line out of it

1315
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,680
finding the actual named cut once

1316
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,639
there's a whole bunch of of

1317
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:00,639
you know

1318
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,838
yeah other stuff out there that has the

1319
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:03,440
same name

1320
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,679
is problematic

1321
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,880
yeah and it became damn near impossible

1322
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:11,199
in some cases with that you know and uh

1323
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,559
you know and so i mean

1324
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,519
uh you know the uh

1325
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,400
i think

1326
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,838
the super skunk has a semi there's

1327
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,240
obviously there's some pretty famous

1328
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,559
people in the weed community that had it

1329
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,318
so that ends like some gravitas to the

1330
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,480
fact that it was killer

1331
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:31,199
and then they was killer and then it

1332
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,960
comes from this 90s historical era

1333
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,199
obviously right

1334
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,639
and you know and then on top of that it

1335
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,719
it probably

1336
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,639
is in a bunch of other things that

1337
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,959
people don't realize it's in

1338
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,960
right correct and everybody knows what a

1339
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,480
rank skunk smells like everybody in

1340
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,280
america for the most part is probably in

1341
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,159
america yeah ones you know and all that

1342
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,200
and so it's a really distinctive terp

1343
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,960
yeah right

1344
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,679
and it doesn't exist

1345
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,440
it does not you know i mean some people

1346
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,199
on here know some people don't but i got

1347
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,920
lucky enough and i cracked them and what

1348
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,399
became known as the mendo p you know

1349
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,358
and what's interesting about that cut is

1350
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,838
that

1351
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,719
like if that cut didn't exist there's no

1352
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:14,400
other

1353
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:16,399
line that i know of that has those terps

1354
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,358
yeah like those terps are in cannabis

1355
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,559
obviously

1356
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,039
yeah they're obviously in cannabis but

1357
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,719
it's very unique the modern cannabis

1358
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,119
and anything you find that ends up

1359
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:28,000
smelling like that you discover it was

1360
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,119
descended from that yeah right

1361
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,039
and so

1362
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,318
you know um

1363
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:35,358
you know the the skunk nose in my

1364
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,639
opinion

1365
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:41,679
really only pops out here and there in

1366
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:44,000
its descendants on occasion

1367
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,598
yes that's the mendo perks yes mendo

1368
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,280
purple indeed

1369
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,800
um so

1370
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,200
um

1371
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,760
you know and so it just doesn't even it

1372
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,439
it uh nobody's found it nobody's

1373
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,680
nobody's made the terps nobody's found

1374
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,760
the terps nobody's been able to produce

1375
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,239
seed lines or cuttings

1376
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,920
any time because if they did

1377
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,318
it would be announced they would be it's

1378
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,639
they would be at conventions or you know

1379
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,759
emerald cup or whatever with jars and

1380
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,000
they would be

1381
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,440
you know it's a lost terp that people

1382
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,679
want back

1383
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,480
anyone who can capture that

1384
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,639
that style terp into

1385
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,920
a seed line that reliably produces it

1386
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:26,799
and and let it stay in the bud form

1387
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,119
is going to master it you know so um so

1388
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,160
it's obviously a lot of constituents

1389
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,920
of it

1390
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:33,519
um

1391
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,960
but man trying to get something that

1392
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:39,759
really hangs with that smell past flower

1393
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,760
is very very hard to do yeah and and you

1394
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,000
know and so everybody ever it's got

1395
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,200
universal recognition of what it should

1396
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,119
smell like

1397
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:50,639
yes there's a whole bunch of fake cuts

1398
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:54,559
that people try to pretend smell like it

1399
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:56,558
right yeah it really did smell like it

1400
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,800
you know and so with it

1401
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,839
there's no faking the funk

1402
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,599
unless you have

1403
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,440
skunk oil

1404
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,200
you can rub it on a jar i mean yeah and

1405
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,200
all and all that and all that

1406
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,919
it's like it's like the scientific

1407
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:14,239
method right like if somebody can't grow

1408
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,480
it and produce the same smell

1409
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,799
it's not there

1410
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,358
yeah exactly it wasn't like you had to

1411
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,480
do a bomber job of growing it dude you

1412
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,799
know i mean

1413
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,159
you know obviously in the 90s uh we've

1414
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,119
all gotten quite a bit better at

1415
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,879
gardening

1416
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,440
oh yeah yeah older you get more

1417
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,280
experienced you learn more there's way

1418
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,318
cooler products that make your life

1419
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,440
easier

1420
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:40,480
you know um and i mean we used to mix

1421
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,559
soil in a [ __ ] cement mixer

1422
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,960
yeah from raw amendments

1423
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,280
yeah yeah it wasn't all these biological

1424
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,199
amendments there wasn't all these like

1425
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,440
you know inoculants and

1426
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:54,239
booze and teas and this and that like

1427
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,200
there is now it was like there's like gh

1428
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,959
and you know earth juice and i mean the

1429
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,558
even just the stuff that you could get

1430
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,559
and like you were and you were just

1431
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,280
happy that the store carried

1432
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,319
yeah sure pretty limited compared to now

1433
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,280
you know

1434
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:10,159
um

1435
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:14,079
and so that terp just it just existed

1436
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,838
you grew it uh you grew it um

1437
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,960
someone's saying about the mendo perps

1438
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:21,279
it is not from the pacific northwest no

1439
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,199
think about that question for a second

1440
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,760
think about that question

1441
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,919
is mendo purp from the pnw i mean you

1442
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,760
know it's too it's cool dude any ques

1443
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,000
whoever asks that any question is no

1444
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,800
he's turpin bird's cool yeah and it

1445
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,639
really

1446
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,000
down to it like most that's the thing

1447
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:37,920
right is that

1448
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,599
just so you know like you know matt and

1449
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,280
i are gonna do uh we're gonna we're

1450
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,000
gonna uh do a

1451
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,240
a podcast pretty soon here and chat

1452
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,159
about history and really what it boils

1453
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:49,519
down to for me is like without the i

1454
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:51,358
don't really give a [ __ ] about fame or

1455
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:53,199
rep or anything like that

1456
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:55,119
most of our history in the cannabis

1457
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,879
community is oral

1458
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,880
you know passed down from people to

1459
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,039
people and there are people that have

1460
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,720
heard the real deal and have verified

1461
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,279
and cross verified

1462
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,959
type stuff you know um but it can be

1463
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,359
really hard for people to come along

1464
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,760
later or don't have personal connection

1465
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,759
to something i mean [ __ ] spreads

1466
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,680
like wildfire at times

1467
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,839
you know and certain people

1468
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,598
have vested interests

1469
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,759
in spreading [ __ ]

1470
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,880
and so you know counteracting that with

1471
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,760
truth

1472
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,559
um and uh

1473
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,559
you know so

1474
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,119
but yeah you know it really is it is

1475
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,200
it's an underground it was an

1476
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,480
underground illegal venture

1477
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:41,279
and lots of little individual groups

1478
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,318
um you know like passing on knowledge to

1479
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,440
each other

1480
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:47,838
you know and it just so happens that you

1481
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,440
know like uh the grateful dead

1482
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,078
uh and the kids that followed the

1483
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,920
grateful dead um that was probably like

1484
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,680
the greatest open-air weed market in

1485
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,920
american history at a certain point oh

1486
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,318
yeah and after them after jerry died

1487
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,440
started growing weed because it kept the

1488
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,279
lifestyle going and for a while now it's

1489
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,440
not it's not true anymore you know we're

1490
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,040
just a segment but for a minute you know

1491
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:14,079
in the 90s and mid-2000s like almost all

1492
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:16,558
the best and and most famous cuts

1493
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:19,440
came from some hippie or another

1494
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,119
some crew you know some related group

1495
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,280
and you're only so far removed from all

1496
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,480
those people because it's a small world

1497
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,519
so

1498
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,559
you know

1499
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,759
um

1500
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,800
it uh

1501
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,680
