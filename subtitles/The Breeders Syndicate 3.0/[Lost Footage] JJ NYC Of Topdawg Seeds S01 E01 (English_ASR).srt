20
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,739
audio

21
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,599
try again

22
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,599
let me see if I can move into a better

23
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,519
spot you're a little better

24
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,000
you got better yeah what's up brother

25
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,000
yeah

26
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,400
get by an internet connection always

27
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,400
works the best

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,960
what's going on not much just dealing

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,040
with the normal [ __ ]

30
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,039
you know how it goes

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,759
so um yeah there's a couple things I

32
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,739
wanted to talk to you about

33
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,340
um let's do it one being

34
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:14,719
one being the diesel diesel uh the usual

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,719
is super scum

36
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,878
right you you stated it was super skunk

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,319
I think uh it could be a super skunk

38
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,359
cast one we don't know because there's

39
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,060
no camd coming out of the progeny at all

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,819
in any of the S1

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,979
um

42
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:35,399
that came out of a chemd uh mother

43
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,840
though the MD flower I was told I was

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,260
told by Greg that it came out of the

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,439
super skunk flower that the cam D heard

46
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,719
uh I thought I I was uh told the

47
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,759
opposite but maybe either one of us

48
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,878
either one of us could be wrong Greg

49
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,739
didn't keep good notes as we know

50
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,719
right right and that's correct from

51
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,180
those guys you know him and Louise will

52
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,979
go if you could ask the same question

53
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,980
twice and get two different answers

54
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,439
right

55
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,919
but

56
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:10,019
um but uh have you grown the the my

57
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,318
super skunk no I have never grown

58
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,939
Matthew for skunk never never had it

59
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:19,018
okay

60
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:23,639
because uh you know with the speculation

61
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:27,120
that the mass Super Skunk is with the

62
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,878
sour diesel and I kind of have uh a

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,219
couple discrepancies about that because

64
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:36,299
the mass Super Skunk if you ever grown

65
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:39,180
it it grows kind of medium height and

66
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,099
it's it's a single Cola with a very

67
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,920
thick stem

68
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:48,179
and so like the

69
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,500
theory that it would be part of the the

70
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,280
chem dog

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,620
um with the cam dog making a sour diesel

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,840
uh the growth the growth structure is

73
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,120
just is way off

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,580
yeah you know what I'm saying

75
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,439
um like if you ever if you've grown

76
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,319
cabin 91 next to Sour Diesel like this

77
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,658
the the growth that the sativa growth on

78
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,280
the shower diesel is just

79
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:16,139
I don't know if you've grown it I don't

80
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,819
have to yeah yeah it's night day from

81
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,660
cam 91 sure

82
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:24,779
right so so if the theory of the the

83
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,660
super skunk went into it then where does

84
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:29,459
all that sativa growth come from you

85
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,880
know I mean unless it's a recessive

86
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:37,399
trait but I kind of uh disagree with

87
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:41,819
that because uh I've I've grown the DNL

88
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:46,379
that that I think that uh is part of the

89
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:48,839
uh Sour Diesel and it grows exactly the

90
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,899
same just that really stretchiest

91
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:54,839
achieve uh you have to top it off and

92
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,620
just Branch it out and everything all

93
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,679
right

94
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,720
so that that's just my my yeah I agree

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,579
some of your ddnl and I saw a lot of

96
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
sour traits in it as well

97
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:05,519
I would agree with you right and I

98
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,379
thought and I was going to ask you that

99
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,258
because I thought a while back that you

100
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:13,860
had uh grown some of those uh DNL

101
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,479
crosses and I wanted to get yours

102
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,300
love that [ __ ]

103
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,699
yeah I still sitting on some beans I I

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,160
haven't uh brought them out in a long

105
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,100
time but uh I got so many different

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,960
things I've been working on that uh I

107
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,539
don't know I got to try to get into it

108
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,779
soon especially with all this uh with

109
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,459
all this skunk uh controversies that is

110
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,978
going on

111
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,538
and then speaking of controversies over

112
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:43,620
uh

113
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:46,139
this whole thing with uh [ __ ] giraffe

114
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,280
and that dick Nick yeah

115
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,478
yeah I mean you know if I was skunk VA I

116
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,099
would have just ripped his head off

117
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:53,839
right there on the side I'm surprised he

118
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,419
didn't

119
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,899
uh yeah that dude is just like a mellow

120
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:04,159
dude and he's the kind of dude that once

121
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:08,399
she snaps like

122
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,520
I mean he's got he's got his arms are

123
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,439
the size of my thighs

124
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,719
it's like Popeye he's like a wrestler

125
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,399
he's like a shoe I mean like I couldn't

126
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,240
believe what joint a joint breath told

127
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,399
him to suck his dick or something online

128
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,079
uh yeah but there was he went up to his

129
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:29,758
booth and they had some kind of uh

130
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:33,359
conversation and then he came outside

131
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:38,100
and I was in a circle with uh

132
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,160
the swamp boys and uh Bronson was there

133
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,539
and he just like [ __ ] lost his mind

134
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,300
you know I mean I thought I was gonna

135
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:48,360
have to fight him at first but then but

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:52,139
then I became like his therapist I mean

137
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,600
I kind of had like a shred of Sympathy

138
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,600
for the guy he was Sandy and went to

139
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,639
jail and yeah

140
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,979
everyone hates him and how he wants to

141
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,720
be accepted and and all this other

142
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:05,839
[ __ ] you know you were the voice of

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,220
reason usually you're swinging on people

144
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:12,060
listening stopped fronting I was like

145
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,800
you know you're he he's handing us a jar

146
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,139
of skunk around and I'm like yo you

147
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,478
think that's real roadkill I told him

148
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:22,319
I'd give him you know some kind of skunk

149
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,418
one or something like that like but when

150
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,360
you smell it I mean it kind of has that

151
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:29,879
smell to it but the bud structure itself

152
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,840
is like very kind of

153
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,939
um leafy and sativa like and then smoke

154
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,159
it just it tastes like straight up hay

155
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:40,860
and I'm not saying that to be a hater no

156
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,539
no I'm giving you my best opinion and I

157
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,098
told the mother Hey listen if you had

158
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,300
something that great I would

159
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:49,918
congratulate yeah for sure

160
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,900
everyone's saying [ __ ] to be a hater I'm

161
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,478
giving you my honest opinion and

162
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:57,899
everyone I talked to that was in that

163
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,659
Expo that's all that stuff was just like

164
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,818
yeah he brought it to Emerald cup too

165
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,800
and it was uh and the people that

166
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,780
touched the underside of the jar got

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,860
some orange [ __ ] on their fingers that

168
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,859
smelled like real skunk

169
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,459
bro I didn't he didn't have any of that

170
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,519
going on but

171
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:19,859
poor fella you know

172
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:23,899
he's shorting in dangerous territories

173
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,759
[ __ ] around with Duke and skunk yeah

174
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:28,758
either one of those dudes man they're

175
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,379
like

176
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,278
we'll see what happens at the next yeah

177
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,778
right

178
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,778
let it boil over a little bit

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,019
but you know but you know in there and

180
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,538
then there's all these other guys that

181
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,120
you know were you know say they have the

182
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:49,019
the road killing and I had the original

183
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,480
Super Skunk back in like 1995 and let me

184
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,159
tell you when you just cracked that Joy

185
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,980
or just permeated

186
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,199
you know and then I had gotten to cut

187
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,420
years later it was just it just wasn't

188
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,220
the same it didn't give out those same

189
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:05,219
kind of toys or whatever I don't know

190
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,459
there's a different cut or that you know

191
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,440
you know Cuts just dud out after they do

192
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,239
yeah

193
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,220
and it's starting to happen with the

194
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,680
sour diesel because everyone asked me oh

195
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,899
where's that where's that Sour Diesel at

196
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,838
you know with that old-time Sour Diesel

197
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:25,500
in you got to figure it that's like 25

198
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:29,100
years that's how how long that uh that

199
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,320
cut is now so and it's just been given

200
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,920
you know from person to person from room

201
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,200
to room and I think you know uh Cuts

202
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,479
adapt to the room that they're in so you

203
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,360
know your shower diesel is going to come

204
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,039
out different than my Sour Diesel now if

205
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,379
you start giving out cuts and I start

206
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,879
giving out touch you know after a while

207
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,338
I think there could be you know some

208
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:53,159
type of genetic drift that you know

209
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,800
might happen not anything drastic

210
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:58,500
believe but you know there's this seems

211
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:01,859
to be these three small subtle things

212
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,440
that seem to be missing from the from

213
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,360
the sour uh nowadays sure yeah I mean

214
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,800
acclimates from room to room to room to

215
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,480
room and that thing's so [ __ ] old

216
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,120
yeah

217
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,940
right but I've had we had you know the

218
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,139
original Underdog which was super skunk

219
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,899
NL times a 91. it just went bad on us I

220
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:25,259
mean we had the cut and then after a

221
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,659
while it just it only showed glimmers of

222
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,360
itself you know when it was really

223
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:33,439
really good and it was start you know

224
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,440
the um

225
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,019
went down it was harder to clone and

226
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,299
everything and then after a while my

227
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,980
phone was like he gave to me I did a

228
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,539
little bit of work with it and my phone

229
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,659
was like listen I'm just going to let it

230
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:47,659
go

231
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:53,639
and

232
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,778
I remember just buying from buying weed

233
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,659
there was this stuff called the

234
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,860
wheelchair the the wheelchair and back

235
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,980
in the day

236
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,440
that [ __ ] you know was was given me bomb

237
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,420
and then the same thing after a while

238
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,420
you just could not get the same batches

239
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:10,979
just from buying it after a while and

240
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,979
the same people were growing it and

241
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,100
everything but what's the wheelchair

242
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,899
I'm not sure it was just some type of

243
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,060
um local

244
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:25,919
um strain that was sold in New York City

245
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:30,000
you know back then we didn't really have

246
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:32,759
uh you know names weren't really another

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,019
thing that they are now so

248
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:39,120
uh yeah I have no idea what it was so

249
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,399
let's talk about I-95

250
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,578
yeah I think I've seen so or I think

251
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,860
I've seen some stuff referenced like as

252
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:49,319
the wheelchair or the crippler or

253
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,560
something like that and I'm gonna have

254
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,720
to uh really find out a you know where

255
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,578
that really came from but I think that

256
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
you know those that stuff came from the

257
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:00,059
Amsterdam back back in the day sure did

258
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,699
yeah

259
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,739
let's talk about I-95 that's you that's

260
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,300
that's yeah and that was the other one

261
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,180
that I wanted to do let's talk about the

262
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:12,179
history of it all of it

263
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:15,319
you know uh that's a Money Mike strain

264
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:20,099
and originally he bred that back in like

265
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:24,180
2014 we brought it to the Denver CO yeah

266
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,180
the last Denver cup was 2014.

267
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,078
and we and we brought that it was

268
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:33,659
um

269
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:36,958
it was uh Legend star dog male times uh

270
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:40,679
the triangle kush yeah

271
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:44,539
so he bred that we brought that out

272
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:47,638
um and we were friends with Tara Rojo

273
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:50,399
and we went over to mine full and he

274
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,079
gave us a tour and you know and so we

275
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,259
gave him some seeds I gave him some

276
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,159
store dog seeds he got some I-95 seeds

277
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:57,838
and

278
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,240
you know we you know we're just trying

279
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,779
you know to help the guy yeah let's be

280
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,440
nice not right not knowing well

281
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:11,458
you know going further back he had

282
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,860
invited us to uh share his booth in one

283
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,439
of the first few Denver cups it might

284
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,778
have been 2011.

285
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,000
you know what I mean so

286
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:23,820
um you know we you know I always you

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,860
know respected Phil and you know uh

288
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,040
thank him for you know helping us and

289
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,659
everything and so sure

290
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,699
he used to you know to play with and

291
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:36,719
stuff and um

292
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:40,139
so you know he grew those seeds out and

293
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,519
then see this is where it starts getting

294
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,519
kind of fudgy because

295
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,180
when I confronted him you know he says

296
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:55,919
you know that he had started the seeds

297
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:57,120
and left mindful or I'm not really sure

298
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,719
but

299
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,320
we gave a seeds to fill I mean and then

300
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,500
before we know it uh one of his workers

301
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,860
uh Matt Ross

302
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,320
um started a seed company basically with

303
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,019
the seeds that we gave Phil correct yeah

304
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,500
Phil

305
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:21,839
claims that he he stole them for mindful

306
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,720
took him out and started playing with

307
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,420
him at his house and all but

308
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,060
um you know we held us feel responsible

309
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:33,838
for that

310
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:37,078
and he claims that but you know he uh

311
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,000
like he hired the same guy to run uh

312
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,479
some kind of you know get some kind of

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,419
job in Chicago yeah yeah

314
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,379
so to me I think that you know he kind

315
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:51,000
of set him up to kind of be the bad guy

316
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:53,698
and where I'll feel

317
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,899
spread those genetics all through his

318
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:55,500
his

319
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,019
um

320
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,879
this you know his dealings with eight

321
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,860
yeah

322
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,679
and so he's got the egrets thing and he

323
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,500
does you know other smaller stuff on on

324
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,539
the side yeah I mean like I know you

325
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,240
know he got some stuff in Baltimore and

326
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,620
Maryland

327
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,980
Pennsylvania and I don't know if those

328
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,919
are acreage uh related or not but I do

329
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,139
know they're running the I-95 chemd yeah

330
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:26,578
that those I've made

331
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:29,220
and um and then you know so you know

332
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:31,620
they they did that and then we had uh

333
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,420
Elite the elite guys which those guys

334
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,039
are friends of ours yeah they're good

335
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:37,740
friends of mine too

336
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:42,059
and you know they you know they took a

337
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:45,480
pack on I-95 and did you know they did

338
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:48,739
the same thing I mean they bought them I

339
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,199
mean but then you know they saw what uh

340
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,959
what these guys did with it and they and

341
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:57,120
they started doing the same crosses that

342
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,278
they but they didn't sell it

343
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,620
they didn't sell them but they were

344
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,019
giving them away but just even doing

345
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,240
giving them away you're trying to like

346
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:09,179
make a name for yourself you know I mean

347
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,159
in the way that I look at it is if you

348
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:14,698
know if you buy if you're given a pack

349

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,960
to copy all the work that you've done

403
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,960
yeah

404
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,380
so you know it just seems to be a

405
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,558
you know common trait you know I mean

406
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,020
and you know on Instagram now yeah it's

407
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,779
a different world at least on the forums

408
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,579
like people would get called out all the

409
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,759
time by a lot of people you know what I

410
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,759
mean

411
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,440
yeah but you know now you know it's just

412

435
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,299
guy so hey I got a question for you

436
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,159
um a lot of people don't know what DNL

437
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:21,679
is in the first place can you go over it

438
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,558
for people

439
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:31,200
well as far as I know the DNL originally

440
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:33,178
uh originated was the RFK skunk which

441
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,080
the the

442
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:42,480
um the weasel mic and Gabby went down to

443
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:45,659
a a dead show at RFK and scored a bag of

444
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,220
uh kind bud and found I don't know like

445
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:53,100
eight or ten seeds or whatever so

446
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,620
um they both agreed to split the seeds

447
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:58,558
and when they did it they actually put

448
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:02,099
all the seeds out on the table and they

449
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,619
they each one by one I picked this one I

450
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:07,019
picked that one I picked this one I

451
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:11,219
picked that one and

452
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:16,079
um when the weasel uh

453
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:18,839
and he wound up um getting I don't know

454
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,519
like three different phenos and and

455
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,879
that's when I first met him in Central

456
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:26,099
Park he was sounds drunk one skunk two

457
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,440
skunk three yeah that's what he called

458
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:31,619
him and then

459
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,980
um a friend to his uh

460
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:39,079
wound up getting like some type of um

461
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:43,019
some NL seeds and some Hawaiian seeds

462
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:46,980
that you wind up having no seeds and he

463
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:51,179
gave him uh one of some of those uh RFK

464
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,880
clones and so he made his own strain uh

465
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:57,179
combining the three and he just called

466
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,640
it the NL but you know it might have had

467
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:04,460
some NL in it but it was mostly sachiva

468
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:08,340
dominant in instruction

469
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:11,058
and you know and the Hawaiian it kind of

470
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:14,220
had these tropical like

471
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:17,460
tropical skunky tones a little bit yeah

472
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,919
I mean kind of you get you get little

473
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,298
bits

474
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,880
you know you could taste in the sour

475
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:27,839
sometimes you know what I mean

476
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:31,200
um so you know so that was a strain that

477
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:34,158
he grew exclusively and I think that he

478
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,259
gave it back to uh the weasel to grow

479
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:42,140
and you know that's what what I just

480
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:45,658
suspect was in the room when uh you know

481
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,340
those uh seeds were made originally well

482
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:51,539
what weren't made but were found

483
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:54,178
originally I mean in the 91 because I

484
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:57,240
mean I you know I used to sell weed for

485
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,600
the weasel he grew it I sold it but he

486
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,058
had he had vondo and there were a few

487
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:06,418
other people that were that would weasel

488
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:08,579
in and try to uh to buy to buy it

489
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,380
because it was it was like a race

490
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:13,319
because I would you know he would only

491
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,440
get like a couple pounds so it was like

492
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,839
you know you just had to grab everything

493
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,380
that he had at the time just cash him

494
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:25,619
out and this way you had control of of

495
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,360
all of that because you know back in the

496
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:29,699
day people would just come in and just

497
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,859
want to buy it all I mean and I'd be

498
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,759
like I can't sell it to you all because

499
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:37,619
you know I I like to spread it out and I

500
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,558
would sell to other people that did me

501
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:43,319
favors you know I mean so you know

502
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,359
didn't go when I get something and you

503
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,819
know I'll hit you off you can make some

504
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,859
money just do me a favor you know get me

505
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:52,759
you know you save me you know this or

506
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:56,399
that and so you could use it as a

507
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:59,038
bordering tool to you know get other

508
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,600
favors from people sure

509
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,579
yeah

510
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,678
what do you know if the RFK is still

511
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:08,099
around or is that long gone

512
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:11,519
no it's been long gone yeah and then

513
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:15,658
really recently they lost the DNL within

514
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:17,220
the last like two years or so off so I

515
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,720
mean that's why I was thinking about

516
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,779
trying to

517
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,259
you know fall back on some of those uh

518
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:26,879
seeds I've made yeah dude let's see if I

519
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:29,099
can pull anything out that's like the

520
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,900
original that would be real cool real

521
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:33,000
cool

522
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,179
because really I wanted to try to

523
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,700
reverse that into the 91 and see what

524
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:43,340
would happen yeah I mean because when I

525
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:46,860
first started growing uh in like 99

526
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:48,779
you know I you know I you know I had

527
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,819
been selling weed for a long time and

528
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:53,220
anytime I had some anything that was

529
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:56,279
super kill and I found seeds I would

530
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,259
save them I mean yeah and then and then

531
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,259
at one time I had a you know really

532
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,839
badass collection from the 80s and and

533
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,900
all that and the cops took it I got

534
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,158
busted a bunch of cakes

535
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,340
wound up taking it so I wound up

536
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,140
starting a new one and then so I started

537
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,839
that one and when I started getting the

538
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,059
chem dog you know uh you know every once

539
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:21,058
in a while you might find a

540
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:23,940
a seed or two in there so I would save

541
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,759
them and so when I started

542
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,278
um I popped a few of those seeds and

543
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:32,460
really back then there was no really

544
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:37,500
such thing as the sour yeah but you know

545
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:40,380
but you know looking back I had found

546
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,579
some stuff that was very sour like very

547
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,778
sourish you know I mean and I remember I

548
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,519
had um

549
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:49,859
I had

550
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:53,099
something happened I think that we were

551
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:55,079
we were we had to close down to grow

552
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:58,379
whatever and I had just pop these seeds

553
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:01,379
and I sex them and I screamed him and

554
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,900
and I gave the Clone to my friend and I

555
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,000
was like listen I was like I said the

556
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,220
only thing I know that this is like you

557
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,119
know came from out of chem dog and just

558
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:16,860
female and I gave it to him and he grew

559
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:20,038
it out and that became uh the the guava

560
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:23,759
but not the guava of today I got you and

561
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:26,220
he so he called that cut the guava but

562
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,400
it was kind of very sourish and all yeah

563
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:32,880
and he and he ran it and then eventually

564
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,640
lost it you know I mean and then

565
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,360
um years later

566
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:44,580
um I wound up doing the star dog and I

567
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:48,298
had gifted my friends some seeds to give

568
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:49,918
to Andre Grossman uh the photographer of

569
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:52,619
High Times okay

570
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,460
and he

571
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:58,278
um

572
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:02,940
he grew him out and he found afino

573
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:04,558
that was today's guava so what happened

574
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,140
was

575
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,700
um somehow while he well what happened

576
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,778
was

577
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:15,960
they they like that cut so much uh and

578
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:19,079
at the time uh they had uh at High Times

579
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,360
they had their uh the Kyle Cushman

580
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,298
Strawberry Cough yeah and they actually

581
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:26,519
had they had a plant they had a plant in

582
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:29,339
the in the office

583
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,918
and like anyone that that went into the

584
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,599
office if they liked you enough they

585
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,940
would cut you all cut you a couple

586
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:39,899
clones right off the plant in the office

587
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:42,240
and let you go home with them so So

588
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,000
eventually the same thing happened with

589
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,538
the guava

590
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:53,038
and uh both the guava and the Strawberry

591
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:56,519
Cough became the the office strains

592
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:59,400
so years later like I was saying the

593
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,940
same guy that named the guava tells me

594
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,019
that he got the guava he got the guava

595
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,940
back

596
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:06,619
so

597
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,038
um

598
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:14,399
we've eventually find out that it comes

599
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,679
full circle back from The High Times

600
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,000
guys

601
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,538
and so like

602
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,980
um that was how you know that the guava

603
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:29,879
uh kind of got its name of today though

604
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:34,200
uh but it was originally uh some type of

605
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:37,980
rush hour can something the original cup

606
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,960
but I remember it and it was very soured

607
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,360
usually but I don't think well I didn't

608
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,000
get to ever finish it out actually well

609
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:47,459
one of them I did and then another one I

610
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,019
didn't yeah or I mean I did get to

611
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,620
finish one out

612
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:55,019
but then I had popped another seed and

613
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,658
that was the seed that I gave my friend

614
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:00,079
but it came from the same batch though

615
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:03,059
of seeds now

616
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,899
was the stardog guava similar in Terps

617
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:11,038
or anything to the other lava

618
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:13,860
and not really I mean the guava of today

619
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,419
is more comfort-ish

620
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,839
what am I think we'll have to come

621
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,840
forward

622
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,480
where uh the other one was more

623
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:29,880
more kind of 91-ish yeah

624
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,380
a little more fuel easier a little more

625
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,299
fuel salary fuel the original one was

626
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,240
do you still have any of those old uh

627
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:42,379
the purple afghan cross I think you did

628
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,380
a purple star dog with it

629
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,580
um

630
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,960
with a purple store dog with what I

631
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,558
think it was British Empire's purple

632
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,019
afghan yeah I did I never really

633
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,200
um I never popped any of those seeds I

634
00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:01,440
do I'm sitting on them and I think I did

635
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,720
some into the chem D also oh wow

636
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,179
and I think I did some into the original

637
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,100
Haze too those all could be real that

638
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:11,880
Afghan original Haze could be [ __ ]

639
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:13,199
real interesting I I wound up

640
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,659
um

641
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,240
flowering out some of that stuff and

642
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:21,899
some of it was green and some of it was

643
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,200
purple just by yes you know

644
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:28,019
and I wound up using a male and you know

645
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,759
I [ __ ] up and never made f2s out of

646
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,398
that you know

647
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,579
uh but I do have that just just the

648
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,500
crosses into the star dog in in the

649
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,359
chemd yeah that would be fascinating to

650
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:43,019
see Pop back up

651
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:46,199
yeah but uh the purple star dog that I

652
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:48,480
uh that I made you know the purple came

653
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,880
from the tree dog male

654
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,778
and and the purple probably came from

655
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,360
the Afghan yeah it was a uh since he

656
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:59,579
seed uh Afghan

657
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,278
field after anyone

658
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:04,319
Afghan one yeah and I think you know

659
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:08,480
looking back into that that wasn't

660
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:12,720
really like a true uh

661
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,720
uh cultivar as in one string I think it

662
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,579
was a mix of their best afghanis or

663
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,419
something like that

664
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:25,740
and then even like looking back into

665
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,960
um the the the the maple leaf I think

666
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,419
even like the maple leaf really wasn't

667
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,720
really uh

668
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:36,720
really like one stable string I think

669
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,200
they were were a variety of different

670
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,538
phenos in there because uh if you if you

671
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,380
look back into the the seed the seed

672
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:48,839
bank catalog they actually offer that at

673
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,500
like a 50 pack or something like that

674
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:55,139
and it's more of like a breeders you

675
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,298
know I mean they don't really I mean but

676
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,919
it sounded like you know there was you

677
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:02,940
know a lot of different different

678
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:06,840
varieties in there but the one guy that

679
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,179
they talk about uh Maple Leaf uh whoever

680
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,079
they called one guy Maple Leaf yeah it

681
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,259
was

682
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,298
of uh you know the fenos that he was

683
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:17,819
growling at the time so I guess all that

684
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:20,038
was Beast off his stuff you know I've

685
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:21,778
always um found that a lot of the stuff

686
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,000
that was listed is maple leaf Indica

687
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,980
like it was used tend to look like The

688
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,940
Afghani won so I don't know if they have

689
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,980
a similar parentage that way back up

690
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,659
I think you know because I look back and

691
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,899
I think you know if you look into the

692
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:40,520
catalogs on The Afghani one it says it's

693
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:43,019
like a mix of their three or four best

694
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,639
afghanis or what or whatever you know

695
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:47,339
but when I grew it

696
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:52,399
it kind of it grew

697
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:55,558
um very fat stemmed uh single coal uh

698
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:57,119
kind of short medium height

699
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,960
and

700
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,500
um

701
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,440
it didn't really have a really uh

702
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:07,919
the Terps on it weren't really super

703
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,720
strong it was kind of subtle yeah and so

704
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,778
that's why I figured it would be a good

705
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,100
out process to go yeah yeah out across

706
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:16,319
into the county because it wouldn't be

707
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:18,678
dominant you know because you kind of

708
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:23,220
had like a kind of a madisony a little

709
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:27,600
madisony thing onto it you know it was

710
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:30,659
decent I mean I I smoked the flour but

711
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,579
you know it wasn't anything uh that

712
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,740
would compare the chem dog but the

713
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:36,298
structure you know that you know

714
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,179
definitely added you know because it

715
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:43,139
gave you that really thick stem yeah

716
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:46,679
you know and and all the all the

717
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:50,159
um the calyx the bud ratio you know

718
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,960
there wasn't much leaf on that so you

719
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,539
were you know you're one of the first

720
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,759
guys I saw from not necessarily the

721
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:58,798
modern era but um

722
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:00,298
prior to the modern era that was

723
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,839
actually using like the Northern Lights

724
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:05,398
the super skunks The Afghani one [ __ ]

725
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,959
like that and that always inspired me to

726
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:10,138
go in that direction for those bass

727
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,599
lines so I appreciate that yeah well I

728
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:15,838
was always a big sense you see fan back

729
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,139
in the day yeah I mean their genetics

730
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:21,659
are not the same unfortunately

731
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,460
yeah but you know but if you looking

732
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,740
back most of that stuff they got from

733
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,740
Neville yeah yeah I mean our stuff was

734
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:32,158
seed bank stuff that you know where

735
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:34,439
Neville was in jail and you know they

736
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,240
bailed him out and

737
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,740
you know they gave them money or

738
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,719
whatever so

739
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,479
I'm pretty sure that that was the story

740
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,878
behind that yeah some of the best stuff

741
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,740
there is as far as bass lines go I think

742
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,858
if people don't grow that stuff they

743
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:51,539
won't have an idea of a lot of the

744
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:52,980
traits and modern stuff like they're

745
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:55,079
they're they don't have a good base

746
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,139
knowledge

747
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,519
and and looking back like I know people

748
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,319
you know that I've talked to the

749
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,699
drunkers and they've admitted that

750
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,559
they've lost all their mother yeah

751
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:10,139
but you know someone like Adam Don he

752
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:14,279
was working you know wisdom back in the

753
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:18,000
90s and so he you know knows firsthand a

754
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:20,940
lot of that stuff that went on uh

755
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,460
but you know he uh he you know he

756
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,240
laughed after he left that's real you

757
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,280
know

758
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,719
and then uh I don't know who else was

759
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,119
doing it but I don't know who else was

760
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:33,000
doing her breathing

761
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,099
um back in the 90s I'm not sure

762
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,639
but you know what because you used to be

763
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:42,059
able to get the cellophane uh cord packs

764
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:45,319
yeah and then they upgraded to the box

765
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:45,320
with the bubble yeah

766
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:53,338
and beating up a little leading up until

767
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:55,980
today because my friend he had bought a

768
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:58,259
pack of Jack Herrera like you know the

769
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,858
year it won the cup or whatever

770
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,859
and um you know he grew it out you know

771
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:08,480
I was selling the weed and after a while

772
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:11,699
uh they need this kind of people got

773
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,800
sick of it you know I mean they started

774
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:16,799
doing okay told him to stop doing it

775
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,320
he's like oh don't worry I'll kill it I

776
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,180
still have the whole pack left you know

777
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,720
years later I said hey why don't you

778
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:27,539
look for that pack well I lost it yeah I

779
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,519
mean so then I was able to grab a pack

780
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:31,800
of the boxes

781
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:35,039
and I gave him a pack of the Jack

782
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,019
Carrera and he grew it out and

783
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,980
this way it just wasn't it wasn't the

784
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:42,179
same yeah

785
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:44,880
yeah I mean it was a really it was junk

786
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:47,659
and you know I think really by then

787
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:52,160
that's when a lot of people started

788
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:56,039
Outsourcing to uh yeah

789
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:59,059
a lot of that stuff comes back you know

790
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,059
it's kind of like

791
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,779
but it's you know it grows very

792
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,260
sativa-like but it you know it's kind of

793
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:13,200
wispy and like I don't know I just call

794
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:16,320
it like generic answers yeah

795
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:19,019
yeah and like even like Adam says you

796
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,559
know like that the the Jack itself is

797
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:26,159
like I don't know like a 12-way you know

798
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,920
12 Way Cross or something I mean just

799
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,679
four things that just crossed back into

800
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,579
each other and after a while just

801
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:39,419
becomes like uh you know it's genetic

802
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:42,839
like messing yes where it just comes

803
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,780
it's just very generic and

804
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,400
in what it's producing becomes a muddled

805
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,220
mess

806
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,660
right it looks like we got a minute left

807
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:56,399
anything else you want to get in my man

808
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:58,980
well we got into pretty much everything

809
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,180
I'm surprised we're able to squeeze it I

810
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,159
know dude well hey it's a pleasure

811

00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:13,799
just you know iron out some of the

816
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,939
