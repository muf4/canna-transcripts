you're currently doing with your your

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,460
career

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,500
um so let's start at the beginning let's

35
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,118
start talking about one of the

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,859
one of the Clones they held your

37
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,478
interest the most uh when you first

38
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,340
started growing what was circulating at

39
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,259
the time

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,540
um I mean when I first started growing

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,519
it was just I I had gotten random clones

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,140
from a few different people uh they

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,199
weren't really anything special it was

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,819
something orange really low yielding uh

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,560
that's what I ran for my first several

46
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,758
grows and it was kind of depressing but

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,140
it was better than nothing because it

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,379
had a good smell and it was you know

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,319
decent smoke at least for me at the time

50
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:06,179
but the main ones uh you know I would

51
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,519
say probably when the lemon G and the

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,959
Death Star came into my light was like

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,060
really when I saw like the full

54
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,739
potential of like good quality cannabis

55
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,378
and

56
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,360
um and it's it really fascinated me so

57
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:19,560
that kind of like gave me the oomph to

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,400
take it to the next level and take

59
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,560
things seriously and uh and I did and I

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,020
you know grew those for a long time for

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,300
over a decade straight and uh made a lot

62
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,340
off of them how early into your like

63
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,780
smoking like from the age of where you

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,539
started smoking to where you started

65
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,039
growing like how long did it take until

66
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,318
you started getting like death star

67
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,679
quality type weed okay so when I first

68
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,479
started smoking I was probably around 13

69
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,640
and uh I was just get I got weed from

70
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,560
this kid at school and he stole it from

71
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,419
his dad and sold it to me for you know

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,699
twenty dollars I paid him in rolls of

73
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,699
quarters I stole from my my parents

74
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,679
closet or something like that you know

75
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,959
um and smoked it and I didn't get high

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,900
yeah so the first time I really ever

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,819
smoked weed I never really got a buzz

78
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,659
and then um

79
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:11,098
later on you know I would you know High

80
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,259
School came around you know we had

81
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:16,259
access to the swag basically the seated

82
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,000
pressed Mexican stuff right yeah um

83
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,979
there's different varying levels of that

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,780
uh some were actually surprisingly good

85
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,959
except it wasn't really compressed it

86
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,000
had the nice mature seeds in it uh a lot

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,519
of lime green stuff like that too we

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,098
call it the Christmas trees but uh there

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,140
was good stuff as well but um

90
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,878
I don't know I would say probably my

91
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,859
sophomore year of high school was when I

92
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,439
discovered what we called at the time

93
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,659
kind bud KB

94
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,120
um and it was in Akron at a college

95
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,378
party and one of my smoking buddies and

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,259
good friends I've known for a long time

97
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,459
came downstairs and showed me this I was

98
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,340
out on the porch and he showed me this

99
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,598
Bud he's like look at this KB bro and

100
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,739
I'm like what the hell is KB like

101
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,439
I'm looking at it I'm like what the hell

102
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,299
is this he's like it's weed and I guess

103
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,158
I looked at it and smelled it I was like

104
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,080
you gotta be kidding me dude

105
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,239
oh that's confusing going from

106
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,819
compressed to seeing like your first

107
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,340
actual game right Bud like well-grown

108
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:17,159
manicured [ __ ] personally Bud yeah

109
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,959
yeah so at that point I had already been

110
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,340
uh selling stuff for a while I did

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,139
through high school and stuff just to

112
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,698
make extra money we you know I didn't

113
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,060
come from the wealthiest family in the

114
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:29,520
world by any means so uh it's kind of in

115
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,560
a you know growing up situations kind of

116
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,299
every kid fend for himself after a

117
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,579
certain point so

118
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,660
I did what I had to do to survive and

119
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,359
make money

120
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,100
so that's how uh that's what I did for a

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,740
while and then eventually you know after

122
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,040
I mean senior year I grew some plants I

123
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,800
grew my first plants yeah uh outside my

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,479
parents backyard way in the back and I

125
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,759
planted them late and they weren't going

126
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:55,740
to finish in time and I knew it so I dug

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,479
them out of the ground and put them in

128
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,220
pots and brought them inside and put

129
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:00,779
them in my closet to finish out like the

130
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,120
last you know three weeks or whatever

131
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:06,359
they needed yeah I line the whole closet

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
with tinfoil black light black lights in

133
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,919
there like you know what I mean yeah

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,160
yeah totally and it was it was looking

135
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,599
back it's just hilarious but um I was

136
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,939
worried I was gonna get caught my mom

137
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,500
wasn't super mean but she would uh she

138
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:20,478
would look my ass probably and I thought

139
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,120
yeah

140
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,399
and uh I had harvested it eventually and

141
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,740
then like months later maybe a year

142
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,899
later she told me that uh while I was at

143
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,000
school she was watering it because it

144
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,579
was about to die that whole time but she

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,199
never told me and my mom was a gardener

146
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,639
too I grew up growing flower all kinds

147
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,340
of flowers and planting gardens at our

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,500
house and other people's houses so

149
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,538
that's kind of like you know we're I got

150
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,279
a little bit of a green thumb before the

151
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,800
whole cannabis thing so I understood how

152
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,138
things work and yeah and you know how to

153
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,000
water and how to feed and you know what

154
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,860
a healthy plant looks like and what a

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,819
sick plant looks like and all that kinds

156
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,819
of stuff how to prune them

157
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,780
um and then I never heard that story

158
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,459
about your mom that's funny too bless

159
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,138
your heart she's a she's a sweet lady

160
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,138
she's been put through hell over her

161
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,120
lifetime but man I can't even picture my

162
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,740
grandma being like Oh I'll just take

163
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,240
care of the thing like you know what I

164
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,379
mean that's pretty cool that's pretty

165
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,000
rad

166
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:23,219
yeah so um I would say uh what was it

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,139
probably right after right after high

168
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,300
school is really when I started you know

169
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,759
growing pretty good and I you know

170
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,978
probably three four years after that I

171
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
uh I'd say

172
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:35,758
2005 six seven ish right around those

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,399
years I started getting a lot of really

174
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,960
good genetics I moved up to Akron

175
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,339
and uh I met a friend of mine who is

176
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,779
still a really good friend of mine we

177
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:49,318
know each other for a really long time

178
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:52,019
he's a good guy his name's Jay and he

179
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,819
shared a lot of really nice clothes with

180
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,758
me he shared the

181
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,560
the Bubba Kush

182
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,160
he shared the lemon tree The Afghani

183
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,139
mango the Death Star the sour diesel

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,460
uh those were like the main ones you

185
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,259
know we've had different things over the

186
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,939
years and stuff this is very early at

187
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,740
that time to be getting close like that

188
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,360
too for people listening yeah that

189
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,000
aren't aware this is actually pretty

190
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,639
early to be uh having access to stuff

191
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,918
like that in in random circles so it's

192
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,199
pretty cool that's a good connect

193
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,579
I had the Indiana bubblegum was around

194
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,439
at that time

195
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,139
um one of the very first ones I ever got

196
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,459
is one that 99.9 of the you know percent

197
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,560
of the people listening aren't gonna

198
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,839
know what it is unless you're local but

199
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,780
it was called um wanaki some people say

200
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,418
hunaki and it was pretty frequent early

201
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,159
2000s around this area being sold

202
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,500
and a lot of people around here remember

203
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,979
it uh so that's one I've had in my

204
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,839
collection you know since probably 2000

205
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:51,719
and what's happening like

206
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,060
it's a it's kind of like Jack oh really

207
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,800
yeah um I've done a lot of research it

208
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,620
might I don't know what it is I feel

209
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,439
like it could be like J1 maybe or I

210
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,240
don't know it came from it was a big uh

211
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,779
a lot of the big Asian crews around this

212
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,478
area uh ran that it was a it was a big

213
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:10,799
one uh and it was everywhere but this

214
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:12,719
was back in the day it was for a short

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
period of like two or three years that I

216
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,419
remember our group getting it

217
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,159
consistently

218
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,740
yeah yeah that was one of the first ones

219
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,780
I got was that a TV

220
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,340
yeah it was it was pretty yeah it's like

221
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,799
it's it's tea lean but it's got like

222
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,839
that funkiness that fun yeah kind of

223
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,819
like thing in it well that's interesting

224
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,218
yeah that's cool it's a beautiful it's a

225
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,778
beautiful plant uh I I don't it's those

226
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,520
kind of plants aren't my favorite to

227
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:38,399
smoke I don't like the chair penalty and

228
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,079
stuff yeah uh but I keep it because I've

229
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,179
had it for so long and I do enjoy the

230
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,158
Aromas uh that come from those plants

231
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,659
and I do I mean I enjoy the looking at

232
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,700
them and growing them and seeing the

233
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,620
different colors and you know yeah

234
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,420
so I keep it around I throw it in the

235
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,100
flower room once every couple years and

236
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:55,019
do a nice one of it

237
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,040
hand it out to friends or something you

238
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,778
know

239
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,059
but if you're a sativa person you know

240
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:01,860
you like that kind of stuff that's uh

241
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,018
you know it's a good plant it's just

242
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,100
super nostalgic yeah it's great if

243
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,919
you're from around here and you're

244
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,959
around in those times

245
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:14,219
so we have that we have the when would

246
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:16,619
you wanaki we called it the knock the

247
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,720
knock okay that's easier the wanaki the

248
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,360
the we didn't want to mess around with

249
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,459
the pronunciation we just called it The

250
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,539
Knack

251
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,919
that wasn't like that was just our

252
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,439
friend group that wasn't like everybody

253
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,659
you know that was just us we referred to

254
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,459
it as the knock so that's one of the

255
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:34,620
really interesting things about weed

256
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,899
that I like a bunch is that how like

257
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,940
especially it seems much more so in

258
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:42,120
America than other places

259
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,500
every crew is insistent on giving all

260
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,019
these different strains they get little

261
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,759
nicknames and then amongst that little

262
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,580
crew it becomes like just what it's

263
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,379
known by you know and so these different

264
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,879
strains at different times can take on

265
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:56,700
different lives

266
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,899
and you only know what your friend gives

267
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,339
it to you as

268
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,559
well so it's like starting off around

269
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,060
girlfriends you know it could start off

270
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,579
as that and then it turns into the knock

271
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,619
and then it turns into this and then you

272
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,940
know and uh it's it's interesting

273
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,740
because sometimes you don't make those

274
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,380
connections unless you know someone that

275
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,980
knew it by both names right

276
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,419
yeah you know it can happen you know

277
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,519
um I mean we definitely have seen

278
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,958
strains that like we think it's one

279
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,700
thing and we'll probably talk about that

280
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,139
a little later but we we think it's one

281
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,339
thing and then lo and behold it turns

282
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,379
out to be another

283
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,779
you know or we think we think it's

284
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,458
another and you know I'm I'm originally

285
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:35,278
from the Midwest too although I've been

286
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:37,079
in California a long time now

287
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,659
um and it's kind of interesting how the

288
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,259
Midwest works in the sense that it was

289
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:46,078
much less like trendy it was basically

290
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,720
like as as pip was saying it's like if

291
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,039
you got something better than Mexican it

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,379
was better than Mexican

293
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,539
and it wasn't there wasn't competition

294
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,600
for it the the desire for something

295
00:10:54,539 --> 00:11:00,480
better than Mexican was huge so any kind

296
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,519
of kind bud you had went any kind of

297
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
right we called it dank you know we used

298
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,600
to call it nuggets and the reason why we

299
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
called it nuggets is because only

300
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,740
nuggets were uncompressed

301
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,439
you know like you had the shape of the

302
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,240
bud the Nugget itself you know and so it

303
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
looked like nuggets where it's like most

304
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,720
other stuff was compressed and even if

305
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,360
it was lightly compressed it still

306
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,920
changed it but if I can stop yeah so you

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,240
know it we had some nice stuff every

308
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,740
once in a while you run around nice

309
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,500
stuff but a lot of the Homegrown stuff

310
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,159
back then was a little bit creamy a

311
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,320
little bit moist still you know

312
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,319
um and then we have my town anything

313
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,360
better than Mexican was kind bud right

314
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,399
right same here like if it was messed up

315
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,259
if it wasn't dried the right way or

316
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,600
cured the right way if it was preemie

317
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,100
there wasn't competition for it there

318
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,720
was still more people that wanted it

319
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,399
than there was it

320
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,519
so it just went

321
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,679
feasters I mean beasters was kind bud

322
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,240
this was kind bud some of you guys

323
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,879
remember that that stuff went for the

324
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,320
same ticket it went for 50 and eight you

325
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,879
know some people probably charging more

326
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,579
I mean if you had if you knew a guy who

327
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,078
knew a guy you'd get the 40 deal but you

328
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:09,120
know straight up it was 50 bucks an

329
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,759
eighth when it first hit the funny thing

330
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,459
about about beasters in Canada is like

331
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,259
the really bad beasters they sent to the

332
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,578
parts of America that they thought had

333
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,439
no competition

334
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:20,519
and then the parts of America they

335
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,560
thought had a little bit more

336
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,480
competition from outdoor or indoor they

337
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,399
would send like a different grade

338
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,740
so depending on what part of the country

339
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,778
you're in sometimes there was some stuff

340
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,120
that was actually pretty damn good

341
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,759
for the time and then there was some

342
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,100
stuff that you were like oh now I will

343
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,819
say our Canadian Watchers have wanted me

344
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:46,159
to to say remember they only sent their

345
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,160
crap down here right yeah

346
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,600
they're like just remember we had good

347
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:53,039
[ __ ] we just didn't share with y'all we

348
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,079
could chat about we could chat about

349
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,819
that later too but pip and I have had

350
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:58,338
some long combos about there's certain

351
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,680
strains he has

352
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:03,899
he even likes them sort of fermented

353
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,000
oh and you know and what I mean by that

354
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,679
is that a lot of times beasters because

355
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,720
I mean think of it it's like it wasn't

356
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,879
cured that great it was still had some

357
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,339
moisture in it and then they'd seal it

358
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,740
in a freezer in a freeze and freezer you

359
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,720
know sealer meals and ship it and it

360
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,000
would get no air exchange for a couple

361
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,519
of weeks until somebody cracked it and

362
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,320
some of that beasters would firm it and

363
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,480
I remember having conversations with Pip

364
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,040
about that and he was like man you know

365
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,019
there's a couple strains that I actually

366
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:34,199
do that intentionally to

367
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,539
because I like the fermentation process

368
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,240
which is almost like that African cob

369
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,759
work yeah in a way right yeah the

370
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,980
fermentation stuff uh you know it seems

371
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,200
to me like a lot of the gassier stuff

372
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,539
that I run it does it really well like

373
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,879
the Death Star uh you know you cure that

374
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,439
at super high humidity uh I had my notes

375
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,179
somewhere I forget it's like I put it

376
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,300
keep it in like a five gallon bucket

377
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:59,879
with a screw top lid for 75 humidity or

378
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,859
something like that for a while and and

379
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,778
not a cold area though you want that

380
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,519
warm air to kind of like get that

381
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,838
process going I feel like it takes a

382
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,419
little bit longer if you keep it in a

383
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,339
cold area but it does good with a lot of

384
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:14,278
the gassy stuff the death star dust RS

385
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,380
ones I did it with it was really good

386
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,259
um I think star dog I think I've done it

387
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,939
with before lemon G it is I love the

388
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,860
lemon G when it's done like that when

389
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,260
it's like slightly fermented like that

390
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,519
it's uh I like it fresh too I like it

391
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,259
both ways it's just you know what's your

392
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,000
preference it's different you know just

393
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:34,620
slightly different but yeah

394
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,059
just so people know too like when we

395
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,639
talk about fermentation if they're

396
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,859
unfamiliar with it a lot of times curing

397
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,139
happens on the stem and if you trim

398
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,959
stuff up kind of quick and it still has

399
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,299
some moisture content going on and you

400
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,159
start to some people call it burping you

401
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:53,219
know all that that's basically like

402
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,439
light fermentation if you're if you've

403
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,480
got fully trimmed work in a bag or in a

404
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,639
in a five gallon bucket like he's

405
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,560
talking about and it's not ready to

406
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,919
smoke yet you're kind of fermenting it

407
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,239
in a way in my opinion at least yeah and

408
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,559
you definitely got to burp it too you

409
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,139
can't just throw a bunch of wet weed in

410
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,059
a bucket and no it's called molding yeah

411
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,620
yeah yeah you don't want to do that

412
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,179
there's a fine line there's a fine line

413
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,519
it takes you a while to figure it out

414
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,620
for each strain and like all that but in

415
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,019
the time frame and all that but you know

416
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,820
I just keep it in room temp and and it's

417
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,639
done pretty good versus like in a colder

418
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,740
area stuff like that

419
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,680
yeah that's a that's a complex process

420
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,659
and I'd imagine a lot of failure uh on

421
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,120
the way to figuring it out well honestly

422
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,519
it was it was by accident really you

423
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,860
know in my earlier years yeah I just you

424
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,899
know left some stuff it just it did the

425
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,120
process by itself I guess I just left it

426
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,799
in a bag or I left it somewhere and I

427
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,120
would notice every time I did that that

428
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,698
stuff that was a little bit more moist

429
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,980
and sat upstairs in a bag after a couple

430
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,719
months or whatever it taste it was like

431
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,659
it was a little bit darker like it was

432
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,459
like like degrading you know but and it

433
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:01,319
wasn't as loud but it wasn't like with

434
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,479
the Death Star it was like sweet it like

435
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,800
loses its gas a little bit and becomes

436
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,659
like sweet

437
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,939
and uh

438
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,740
and it's just I mean it's super smooth

439
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,839
smoke it's way smoother than like

440
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,220
smoking a fresh Bud out off of a plant

441
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,639
or something I remember when you smoke

442
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,100
was super rich it was Thick Smoke

443
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,440
yeah I mean fermented stuff super thick

444
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,720
cloudy smoke oh nice thing I sent you

445
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,300
left about it oh okay I didn't know I

446
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,740
got the flower yeah it's uh dude it's

447
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,819
it's awesome I enjoy it it's not

448
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,500
something I'm gonna smoke all the time

449
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,420
but like you know it's it's like a fine

450
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,940
wine it's just it's cool smoking and

451
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:37,259
getting that sweet flavor and like I

452
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,600
don't know it's just you gotta you gotta

453
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,159
try it to understand it and that that's

454
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,899
also something that's interesting I

455
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,639
think too about like the era we're

456
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,339
talking about where information didn't

457
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,259
exchange as fast and a lot of times like

458
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,899
when I learned like how I cure and stuff

459
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,240
it was kind of like you dry things and

460
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,100
sometimes it goes well and sometimes it

461
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,339
doesn't and then sometimes you learn

462
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,139
things good and bad by accident on right

463
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,519
how you treated it you know and that's

464
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,140
kind of what it sounds like you know all

465
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,279
you you put it up there you put it in a

466
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,199
bag and all of a sudden it did this

467
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,459
thing you weren't expecting and then

468
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,199
you're like oh well how did I do that

469
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,480
and you start playing with like what you

470
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,160
did to make it do that right you know oh

471
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,660
does it work with this other strain nope

472
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,640
this strain doesn't like it at all but

473
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,980
this strain boy do I like what it does

474
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,959
does when it does that and I think

475
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,519
that's kind of cool because you know a

476
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,759
lot of times one of the cool things

477
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,859
about growing in the midwest is that

478
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:32,640
because change was slower back home

479
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:34,859
people grew the same strains for longer

480
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,419
there was there was less turnover where

481
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,918
like all of a sudden your customers are

482
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,820
like oh this is bunk I need something

483
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,059
new

484
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:44,759
oh yeah that doesn't happen

485
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:46,619
yeah they were just stoked you get what

486
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,519
you what's there that's that's what it

487
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,439
is

488
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,960
and so as a result of that sometimes

489
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,240
Midwestern Growers really got to dial in

490
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,700
certain strains because they had a long

491
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,400
relationship of success by being able to

492
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,259
grow them right um and it's also we'll

493
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,759
talk about that soon

494
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:04,619
um some of the some of the stuff that

495
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,500
you know that uh pip has in his

496
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:10,139
collection is pretty rare Nationwide

497
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,640
because there wasn't pressure to move on

498
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,500
to a new thing

499
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,720
you know there was various clones and

500
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,640
cuts getting passed around locally and

501
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,759
they did well locally so they had their

502
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,559
own they had a life of their own almost

503
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,599
um we're in California you know populate

504
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,918
you know popularity changes and all of a

505
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,379
sudden everyone dumped something and

506
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,059
just moves on to the next new thing

507
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,760
right

508
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,259
you're exactly right you were able to I

509
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,200
mean you were you were telling us

510
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:39,240
you know death star and lemon G like

511
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,038
were the better part of a seven eight

512
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,880
year run for you in terms of success

513
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:47,940
right I mean yeah man I mean I've I read

514
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,740
them hard hard for you know at least

515
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,419
eight years you know and then I kind of

516
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,120
brought new other strains in and I was

517
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,820
still running lemon G and death star so

518
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,439
so over that over that time you know you

519
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:01,019
know especially with indoor where you

520
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,538
get to do a number of rips a year you

521
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:06,119
really get to learn how the plant likes

522
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:09,058
to grow how big to get it what size pots

523
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,619
how to feed all that type of stuff you

524
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:12,418
know really like you really get it's

525
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,819
like a long-term relationship you really

526
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,880
get to know your partner you're right

527
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:21,298
you're so right man it's uh you know it

528
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,580
took me uh I'd say it probably to fully

529
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:25,139
Master Lemon G consistently uh

530
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,960
especially on a bigger scale you know

531
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,179
took me probably a solid four or five

532
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,980
years uh you know and that was at the

533
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,780
beginning when I started growing too so

534
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,980
nowadays it probably it's not as

535
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,619
difficult but

536
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,558
uh it's a finicky plan it's not

537
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:43,379
something that you can throw in with a

538
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,019
bunch of other plants and expect it to

539
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,000
you know do well you got to kind of like

540
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:50,460
give it its own environment its own

541
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,900
everything like lemon G doesn't like a

542
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,340
lot of light it doesn't like a lot of

543
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,280
heat like cannabis plants in general

544
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,918
don't but lemon G especially

545
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:02,339
um I raise my lights up to do crops and

546
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:05,038
it flourishes under you know 25 watts

547
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,779
per square foot like really really low

548
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,279
lighting

549
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:10,200
um that's half of what suggested I

550
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:14,220
believe they suggest what 50 60 watts

551
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,840
per square foot yeah so and that's what

552
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,980
I've been running for most of my life

553
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,159
honestly

554
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,919
um it's it's I I like that I get good

555
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,240
quality off of it and it keeps the heat

556
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,799
down because I don't have to have a

557
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,700
bunch of Lights packed in somewhere you

558
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:30,480
know

559
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,819
but I also think it keeps the Terps

560
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,220
um a lot of times one you know you you

561
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:36,779
do two hotter lights on the top foot and

562
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,819
a half of your plant might look gorgeous

563
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,740
but it might have some of the Terps

564
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,259
burned out by the intensity and like

565
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,480
actually the bottoms tend to smell and

566
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:48,119
taste better so you can get away with

567
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,160
less light more of the plant brings out

568
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,139
some of that subtlety I guess

569
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,820
and in my area we've always I should

570
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,038
mention we've always had low ceilings

571
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:58,558
the houses at low basement ceilings in

572
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,980
the houses around so uh you've actually

573
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,319
seen before so uh I was kind of a lot of

574
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,298
people around here use 600 Waters and

575
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,519
that's what I've used pretty much since

576
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:12,179
I started I've used thousands before but

577
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:15,359
90 of what I've done is all been 600

578
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,940
watt lights so

579
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,319
yeah Amsterdam had the same thing when I

580
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,298
first started going there they were all

581
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,460
four and six hundreds they thought

582
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:25,259
thousand Watts were crazy American stuff

583
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,419
yeah

584
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,519
so now that we're on to Lemon G let's

585
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,140
talk a little bit one about the genetics

586
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,058
of lemon G

587
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,500
um the history of lemon G and the

588
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,599
terpene profile of lemon tree because

589
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,159
that's really like I think I mean what

590
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,798
most people find really exceptional

591
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,120
about lemon juice that flavor smell all

592
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,658
that goodness

593
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:47,459
um my first introduction to it was uh on

594
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,620
the forums you know there was there was

595
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,440
some speculation about it being skunk

596
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:55,319
Misty something you know there's some

597
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,380
speculation G13 hash plant you know

598
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,178
expression what have you found out

599
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,559
well there yeah there's you know I've

600
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,440
been told a lot of things over the years

601
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:06,058
I've been married to a lot of theories

602
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,980
different theories over the years a

603
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,000
couple at least yeah

604
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,460
um

605
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,279
and you know

606
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,400
a lot of a lot of what you read is not

607
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,119
the case uh some people are close you

608
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,880
know

609
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,399
um but I was able to get the story from

610
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,080
a friend of mine who worked for the lady

611
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,580
who made it I'm not going to mention her

612
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,158
name sure

613
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:33,359
um but she is local to you know the

614
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:36,240
state that I'm in and uh and she told

615
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:39,719
him that it was uh then it was I'm sorry

616
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,319
skunk Misty uh crossed with uh some g13.

617
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,240
now the G3 the G13 this this lady got as

618
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,579
seeds from I believe from a friend I

619
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,640
don't think she ordered them yeah uh I

620
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:55,259
don't know what they are I have no idea

621
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,480
um G13 skunk G13 hash plant G13 and L2

622
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,700
how many G13 crosses was there you know

623
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,159
yeah yeah who knows uh

624
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,340
but that's uh you know and this is a

625
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,640
good buddy this is uh my my my really

626
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:11,158
good buddy who he wouldn't [ __ ] me

627
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,320
or anything like that so uh that's what

628
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,059
she says that's from her mouth that's I

629
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,379
guess what she's always said so just to

630
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:18,538
kind of clear that up that's where the

631
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,039
stories add on the lemon tree as far as

632
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,759
what it is

633
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:24,538
um

634
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,038
I don't know exactly what year uh it was

635
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:28,700
made I would assume it was probably

636
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,500
somewhere in like the early 2000s yeah

637
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,179
uh that's kind of like what I feel but

638
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,538
I've never really gotten an exact date

639
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,360
on it so and the terp profile how would

640
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:41,099
you best describe the flavor of G3 or

641
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:46,139
lemon G sorry

642
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:49,139
lemon juice lemon G lemon G is very very

643
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,140
lemony

644
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:55,439
um yeah not hardly I mean no no Turf in

645
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,019
a lean or anything like that really do

646
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,880
you notice any Matt no okay because I

647
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,220
can't pick it up if there is any uh

648
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,600
lemon

649
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,600
and uh lemon rind and lemon

650
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,179
it leans lemon astringent yes you know

651
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,038
like it doesn't have a lot of sweetness

652
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,259
on the back end it has like a very

653
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,440
pungent lemon

654
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:22,019
let me stop let me stop you sir when you

655
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,159
grow it like crap it gets that very it's

656
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:28,500
that very like Randy bitter almost smell

657
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,740
but if you if you grow that plant good

658
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,079
it comes out like sweet sugar candy

659
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,339
lemon G

660
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,960
I'm telling you there's it's a finicky

661
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,699
plant and most people get rid of it

662
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,140
because they can't they can't get it to

663
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,120
perform right they just get that like

664
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,700
basic version of it like Frank like uh

665
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:46,319
he was just talking yeah so yeah just

666
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,140
get that basic version

667
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,119
and um and they have a hard time with it

668
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,340
but like I said it took me some of your

669
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,819
faces as we both realized ah we only

670
00:24:53,339 --> 00:25:00,418
ever grew it like [ __ ] no but I mean it

671
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:02,519
it I I haven't I I have a thing with

672
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,500
Citrus where like you know there's

673
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,839
there's a range there from like spraying

674
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,759
mouth like cleaner into your mouth to

675
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,038
like a little like I tend to like the

676
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,379
sweet back end because it balances the

677
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,298
astringent you know

678
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,620
um and it's one of those things where

679
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:22,259
for me like I love Citrus but I have to

680
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:25,139
have other things need other things I

681
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:27,359
can't have citrus be my only weed yeah

682
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,820
you know when I described lemon G I

683
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,939
always tell people it's like a lemon

684
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:36,000
came into a being formed like a human

685
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,900
form and then pissed lemon into your

686
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,819
mouth

687
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,038
that's about how I can describe lemon G

688
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:45,000
it's just so lemon I it's it's very

689
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:47,640
unique to me uh I've I've seen a lot of

690
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,778
plants and I was lucky to get that plant

691
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,179
or I was so lucky to get that plant

692
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:53,700
earlier yeah I mean that I can't believe

693
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,919
it but it's so it's still to this day

694
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,259
it's so unique there's nothing that I've

695
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,538
ever seen really that smells like lemon

696
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:02,778
G like lemon G does that didn't come

697
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:05,099
from lemon juice

698
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:06,599
like when you pull lemon G out and you

699
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,480
give it to somebody that's never smelled

700
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,579
it before I don't care who you are your

701
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,400
eyes are lighting up like you're like

702
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:16,619
what is this you know

703
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,960
um it just blows you away and it's a

704
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:22,619
good Buzz uh indoor it's it's decent

705
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,600
outdoor that plant is magical I love the

706
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:26,339
buzz of that stuff outside and I will

707
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:30,000
only smoke lemon G if it's grown outside

708
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:33,538
oh wow um it's just so much better in my

709
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,099
opinion um but I I grew it indoor most

710
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:36,658
of my life and it's still good don't get

711
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:39,359
me wrong it's still good it's a it's a

712
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:41,940
light Buzz it's happy yeah it's 100

713
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,500
percent it's all my female customers

714
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,360
over the years require it's the number

715
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,278
one requested for some reason the ladies

716
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,558
absolutely love it it keeps it gives

717
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,240
them energy they clean on it you know

718
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,278
and all that stuff

719
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,960
so um

720
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,058
so yeah it's been uh it's been pretty

721
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,419
you know pretty popular with the females

722
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:02,879
as well have you um have you tried lemon

723
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,400
tree or lemonade yet

724
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,679
uh I haven't I've heard lemon tree

725
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,900
smells a lot like lemon G but I tend to

726
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,500
think that they're related some ways to

727
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,778
me it's it has to be a lemon tree it has

728
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,000
to be yeah in my opinion

729
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:19,619
yeah uh another thing I wanted to

730
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,659
mention is my buddy mentioned that he

731
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:25,798
had smoked uh my same good buddy again

732
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:28,740
he smoked um uh the G13 what was it it

733
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,000
was a G13 skunk uh back in the day and

734
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,859
he said that's the closest thing he's

735
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,380
ever spelled to Lemon G it was like very

736
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,939
spot on but it was just kind of mild so

737
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,740
I thought that was a kind of interesting

738
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,298
you know thing and then I know a lot of

739
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,778
people are going to ask about what's the

740
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:45,538
skunk Misty as well yeah and honestly

741
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:48,119
um I haven't I I wish I could tell you

742
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,558
it's probably uh they had a string

743
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,058
called Misty back in the day it didn't

744
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:52,859
they Nirvana or something Nirvana

745
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:54,720
Nirvana seeds not to be confused with

746
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,298
your people always confused Nirvana with

747
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,460
Gypsy Nirvana whenever I say oh yeah so

748
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:00,658
no Nirvana seats had a Misti and I can't

749
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,940
remember off the top of my head I can't

750
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,640
remember what it was NL something

751
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,640
and so basically everything in Amsterdam

752
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,919
then that wasn't from Neville or a few

753
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,659
other breeders almost everything was was

754
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,240
something by Skunk one

755
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,059
pretty much you know so having something

756
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,720
that was Misty by Skunk one in the 90s

757
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:23,700
that was the most common hybrid in

758
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,038
Amsterdam was something by Skunk one

759
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,380
right because skunk one was just

760
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,079
consistent you know and I actually can

761
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,059
kind of like that the G13 straight cut

762
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:36,658
that you had pip

763
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:38,460
um I can kind of see skunk and G13 in

764
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,320
that lemon G

765
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,179
yeah oh yeah

766
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,639
um I mean lemon G is kind of like it's

767
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,380
kind of got that uh this is this is like

768
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,159
people don't take this the wrong way but

769
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,440
it kind of has that like ugliness to it

770
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,299
you know there was an ERA where like we

771
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,538
didn't have to be pretty

772
00:28:54,298 --> 00:29:00,480
you know and lemon G definitely has kind

773
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:03,960
of that like G13 like weird Bud

774
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,419
formation Leaf formation especially look

775
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,460
you know and then you know from skunk

776
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,900
one some kind of citrus coming through

777
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,200
is pretty common

778
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,080
so I can see you know it's it probably

779
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,298
the skunk one probably took the G13 from

780
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,058
being leafy in a mess and made it gave

781
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:22,918
it that nice running Cola that probably

782
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:25,379
made it such a good Cropper for you for

783
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,940
a long time right you know

784
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,179
and uh

785
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,038
yeah I I saw you know the lemon G for

786
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,380
the longest time or let me start by

787
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,778
saying actually first uh there's a G13

788
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,960
clone that's gone around this area for a

789
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:42,480
long time since I was in school still my

790
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,480
parents my friend's parents grew it and

791
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,740
my other friend's parents grew it and um

792
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,120
eventually I got it and that thing is I

793
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,640
thought for sure that is what was used

794
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,739
for lemon G because you could smell

795
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,240
that in the lemon G like it's obvious

796
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,859
you could smell that plant and the lemon

797
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,899
G it's like okay these both came from

798
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,219
the same state you know they're they

799
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:03,778
smell related they're probably related

800
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,919
so I just always figured that's kind of

801
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:07,140
what it was

802
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,240
but um and I don't know what that it's a

803
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,299
what that G13 plant I don't know if it's

804
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,519
an Airborne G13 cut from the forums or

805
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:17,278
whatever I'm not sure it's just a short

806
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,119
little stubby Afghan

807
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,000
um

808
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,619
it's it it's not really like it's

809
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,259
nothing really a lot of people would

810
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,879
prefer to smoke or grow these days I

811
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:30,179
feel yeah it's more like your head stash

812
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,799
unique old-school Afghani type of type

813
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,840
of stuff with like a little soapy a

814
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,519
little like it's been a while since I

815
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,319
smelled it I lost it you know when I

816
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,000
went through that whole dudding scenario

817
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:40,139
unfortunately

818
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,640
um I

819
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,500
it's just one I've never been able to

820
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,120
get back I've been looking several times

821
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,159
right like people have given you stuff

822
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:50,158
back and it turned out not to be it

823
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,799
uh I mean I think maybe once with the G

824
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,480
but okay the G is pretty easy to spot

825
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:55,918
like if you get a clone of that and it

826
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,240
veggies up a little even a little bit

827
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,679
you know you might even be able to tell

828
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,679
from clone like it's a really unique

829
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,538
plant oh wow um short squat little

830
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,240
Afghani but we can talk about that in a

831
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:08,099
little bit if you want yeah okay I used

832
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,440
to talk about it and when when we were

833
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,058
looking he would send me pics and we

834
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,759
would always kind of like Wonder is it

835
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:16,678
like is it Airborne is it Pacific is it

836
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:20,339
something more ancient than that that

837
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,019
like survived where he's at and I will

838
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,939
say that like if you look at some of the

839
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:28,139
Neville's few picks that he put up of

840
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:31,038
the classic G13 clone it kind of had

841
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:34,140
that like gnarly ancient

842
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,298
Afghani ugly look to it I thought it

843
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,038
looked very similar for lack of a better

844
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:39,658
turn that's not distant you know there's

845
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:41,879
plenty of weed that I think is kind of

846
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:45,240
ugly that I actually love to smoke cam

847
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,520
91 the ugliest plant ever it's not the

848
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,159
ugliest plant ever but on Earth

849
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,139
no there is definitely some Haze that I

850
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,320
find that I find attractive that is way

851
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,100
more hideous

852
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,599
you know you're like oh this thing

853
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:01,319
doesn't have any Crystal doesn't have

854
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,658
any sugar Leaf it's loose it's calyx's

855
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,639
it's [ __ ] you know and then

856
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,679
uh yeah I curse but we're in the middle

857
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,000
of it

858
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,278
all right you're good we're after a

859
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,558
minute in

860
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,240
but maybe so that we we chatted about

861
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:16,619
the lemon G for a second why don't we

862
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,419
chat yeah the other thing that you got

863
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:21,298
early that you really love which is the

864
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,799
Death Star oh yeah which is a classic it

865
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:24,480
has a great name and it's been

866
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,278
consistently one of your favorites

867
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,599
basically from now to then it really

868
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,619
hasn't shifted

869
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,398
yeah

870
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:34,199
yeah the Death Star is my All-Star I've

871
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,058
loved that plant since the day I got it

872
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,919
the day I smoked it I was so happy the

873
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:40,740
day I got it

874
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,259
um you know I only had probably at that

875
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,899
point like 10 or 12 plants in my

876
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:47,759
collection and it just completely

877
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:50,099
kicked them all out of the water you

878
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,558
know I I like that that hardcore like

879
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:55,439
potency like knock you down put you into

880
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,879
the couch type of stuff and uh and

881
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,159
that's the effect you get off the Death

882
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,919
Star but you know you also get the super

883
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:06,080
crazy like oniony tennis ball like

884
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:09,179
rubber gas like skunk like nastiness

885
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,460
everything's there and you grow a killer

886
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:14,038
people don't understand like I've had

887
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,899
shitty Death Star like where it's grown

888
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,398
to where there's not very much burnt

889
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:20,398
rubber at all where it's more of that

890
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:22,439
oniony spicy back end and it's not very

891
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,199
good but then I've had your death star

892
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,140
where it just kicks its ass so when he's

893
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,640
describing this if if it smells

894
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,140
different than what he's describing it

895
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,179
because he's grown it very very very

896
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,220
well for a very long time so go ahead

897
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,200
continue please on the history of Death

898
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,940
Star okay

899
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,580
um I guess where do I start I guess I'll

900
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,659
start at uh Team Death Star right yeah

901
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:45,058
yeah

902
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,039
um they're from Ohio Columbus area

903
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:50,339
they are the people that created the

904
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:53,158
Death Star the Death Star is a cross of

905
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:55,558
uh Scentsy star and

906
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,620
um Sour Diesel

907
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,418
and they it was an accidental

908
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,219
pollination I guess

909
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,840
um and they had a couple seeds and they

910
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,058
sprouted them and they picked the Death

911
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,319
Star and one of those few seeds that

912
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:09,838
they sprouted

913
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,279
was this amazing plant

914
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,500
um

915
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,899
and I was so lucky I was so lucky to get

916
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,239
it in the mid-2000s at the time when I

917
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:21,898
had you know only been growing for for

918
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,199
five years or something like that and I

919
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:27,059
was just so

920
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:29,219
intrigued by this plant and how potent

921
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:31,019
it was and how much yield it put out so

922
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:33,299
I just started putting it in all my

923
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:34,739
rooms basically that I had that I had

924
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,659
flowering and I just started growing and

925
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,338
growing it growing it and it I mean

926
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,960
there's people at my door with pitch

927
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:42,000
farts you know three weeks before

928
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,878
Harvest like where's it we need it we

929
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,239
need it it was it was scary it just it

930
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:50,639
just it flew off the shelves yeah

931
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,779
um and I enjoyed I was smoking it all

932
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,899
the time

933
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,960
I bet uh but yeah so that it came from

934
00:34:54,898 --> 00:35:00,719
uh from them they got uh

935
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,960
the the sour diesel cut they got I think

936
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,598
came from fish show in Vermont

937
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,358
back in like uh I forget the date it was

938
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,519
like 2004 I think fish did like a

939
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:14,039
farewell show at a airport in Vermont

940
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,300
and um and they picked up I don't know

941
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,559
if they picked it up in Vermont or if

942
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,560
they picked it up back along the way

943
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,599
from Vermont to Ohio but along that trip

944
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,578
is when they acquired that and then um

945
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,859
from what I've heard of another friend

946
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,680
of theirs went to Amsterdam and got

947
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:30,960
seeds and came back and um I guess they

948
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:33,539
were grown and a selection was made and

949
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,980
that was given to team death star by a

950
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:39,059
friend of theirs and then that's how the

951
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,219
cross got the Death Star got made okay

952
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:43,019
one of the things maybe I should mention

953
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:46,019
because it's like a long-term running

954
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:49,139
joke but it ties into what Matt and pip

955
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:52,440
were just discussing is that um

956
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:55,379
you know it it takes probably a good 84

957
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,179
days right uh you know I mean that's

958
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,400
that's about that's that's what I push

959
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:01,319
it to like you can pull it at 77 days I

960
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,358
mean a lot of people told us 70 days

961
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,400
that's where a lot a lot of people make

962
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,019
that's the point I'm gonna make is that

963
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,420
one of the differences and one of the

964
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:12,599
reasons why it might be so good from pip

965
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,180
versus other people is that you know he

966
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,280
was willing to actually see like how

967
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:19,919
long does this thing need to go before

968
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,720
it hits Perfection and what happens like

969
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,119
and this used to happen with sour diesel

970
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,039
a lot in California is that there's

971
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,559
people that would grow it until it hit

972
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,719
the sweet spot and there's people that

973
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,219
would grow it until it hit good enough

974
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,500
for Market

975
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:36,659
and there's a vast difference that like

976
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,460
say you might be able to cut off like he

977
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,159
was just saying if you cut that star at

978
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,300
70 it might fly out the door but not be

979
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,299
as nice

980
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,820
and pip would take it an extra two weeks

981
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,560
and it would reach this extra level

982
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,599
and I think the same thing would happen

983
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,578
with sour out west it would happen with

984
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,619
some other Cuts where it was like there

985
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:57,420
was croppers where like as soon as it

986
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,480
had the nose and was good enough to go

987
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,039
it's time to cut it yeah because there's

988
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,920
a lot of people that don't like taking

989
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:07,199
anything over nine or ten weeks

990
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,240
you know and sometimes not with

991
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,799
everything sometimes you go downhill but

992
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:12,899
with some things if you give it that

993
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,859
extra week or two

994
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,539
um it makes a huge difference

995
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:21,598
you know it lets the potency and the

996
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,820
flavor and some of the depth come out

997
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,440
um and uh you know so I think when Matt

998
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,940
was talking about all this Death Star

999
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,639
sucks there was probably a lot of death

1000
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,338
star that was cut at 10 that needed to

1001
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:35,400
go 12. I'm sure there was a lot cut at

1002
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:38,279
seven and it needed to go 12 too earlier

1003
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,260
you cut it you know the the less nuance

1004
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,660
and depth it'll have

1005
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,640
so yeah

1006
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:47,039
uh one thing else I wanted to add too is

1007
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,598
when this accidental cross happened I

1008
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,759
believe it actually pollinated some

1009
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,500
other plants as well they had uh the

1010
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,660
Indiana bubble gum which was a clone I

1011
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,480
had at this time as well it was popular

1012
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:59,699
around here uh and they had the dumpster

1013
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,338
which is a popular one from you know

1014
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,739
back in the day around here and I think

1015
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:06,779
those were both pollinated uh because

1016
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:09,419
when I was at you know the Festival

1017
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,880
Nelson Ledges in you know the mid-2000s

1018
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,940
I was seeing these strains called Bubble

1019
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,380
star and dumpster yeah I think there was

1020
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,420
maybe one or two more that I can't

1021
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,960
recall right now but I definitely

1022
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:24,240
remember seeing a lot of the bubble star

1023
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,740
um I remember the Death Star was a

1024
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,299
little bit difficult to get and I think

1025
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,919
the Scentsy star was a little bit

1026
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,839
difficult to get as well I don't think

1027
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,940
it was just like lots of it you know

1028
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,279
yeah kind of like

1029
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,019
you mentioned dumpster you mentioned

1030
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,359
dumpster Ohioans are going to want to

1031
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:40,739
hear about dumpster can you rep Ohio's

1032
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,598
dumpster for us what the hell is

1033
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:44,899
dumpster does it smell like a dumpster

1034
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,838
was it really found in a dumpster

1035
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,400
what's the story bro oh that's

1036
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:51,719
I haven't heard it from the horse's

1037
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,760
mouth I've heard a lot of things over

1038
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:55,980
the year and it's it's all generally

1039
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,900
lines up you know things get left out

1040
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:01,940
over the years things get added I guess

1041
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:04,320
so take it whatever I say as is but

1042
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,659
supposedly it was uh there was a couple

1043
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,599
of guys growing together one of them was

1044
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:11,879
known as the professor okay and I was

1045
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,280
told that they basically had a falling

1046
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,599
out and they were they were growing this

1047
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,119
plant and then they had a falling out

1048
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,559
and they threw this whole room away into

1049
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,300
a chat the one guy threw the whole room

1050
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,099
away into a trash can or something and

1051
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,960
then the other guy went back and got the

1052
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,680
cut that they were growing out of the

1053
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,619
dumpster and called it dumpster all

1054
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:34,019
right yeah so I mean that's that's just

1055
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,960
what I've heard I'm not 100 yeah I know

1056
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:38,400
there's more details um I do have some

1057
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,720
connections I can get more details on

1058
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,000
that from but uh you know I think

1059
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,679
what did I what did I say it it kind of

1060
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,079
It kind of reminds me of like the

1061
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,679
there's a garlic Bud pick and have you

1062
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:55,019
ever seen that what is it 1989 yep yeah

1063
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:57,598
it's the seed bank right it kind of

1064
00:39:55,019 --> 00:40:00,539
reminds me a lot of dumpster it's really

1065
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,400
it's it's almost dead on that leaf and

1066
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:06,239
everything it just looks you know just

1067
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,519
like it yeah uh so I've heard people say

1068
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,039
it's you know Shiva skunk you know nl5

1069
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,599
skunk one

1070
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,179
um I mean there was a lot of that sold

1071
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,800
so yeah I mean definitely possible I

1072
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,239
mean the other interesting part just

1073
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,880
real quick before we get up on that

1074
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,578
tangent is that at the seed bank Neville

1075
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,920
called this line garlic bud and then

1076
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,599
when it and then when Scentsy seeds sold

1077
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,700
the same line when they bought his

1078
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,280
company they called it Shiva Shanti

1079
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:33,719
right you know

1080
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,660
um and so there could be some truth to

1081
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,819
both it could you know pip and I have

1082
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:42,299
chatted about it does very much look

1083
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:44,039
like sort of an old NL skunk type hybrid

1084
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,019
of some kind

1085
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,338
you know what does it smell like what's

1086
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:51,059
the chirp profile

1087
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:54,420
uh I classify it as like it's like a a

1088
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:56,699
sweet pineapple with like that toe jam

1089
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,159
Funk there's like a funk in it too you

1090
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:02,039
know uh that's kind of that's kind of

1091
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:04,618
like where I lie with it it's it's uh

1092
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,000
it's good smoke it's decent it's it's I

1093
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:08,338
mean to be honest it's just average

1094
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,679
smoke it's a commercial just typical

1095
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:12,539
like a commercial type variety a lot of

1096
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,519
people did a lot of Growers of dumpster

1097
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,699
in Ohio over the years and oh yeah

1098
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:19,019
because it yields like crazy but um it

1099
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:22,679
does get big buds it's a little bit

1100
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:24,000
prone to mold you gotta watch out

1101
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,098
um

1102
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,440
but overall it's I mean it's a staple in

1103
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,740
Ohio it's been around for 20 years or

1104
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,539
whatever now so

1105
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:36,000
there was a there was a fake one that

1106
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:38,300
went around Ohio I think Jason mentioned

1107
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,119
it in his books it was called chumpster

1108
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:44,099
with a CA with a CH chumpster yeah uh I

1109
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,740
personally never saw that one but I just

1110
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,980
figured I would mention it

1111
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:52,019
uh and it was mostly run in Toledo back

1112
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,460
in the day I believe at first and that's

1113
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:54,719
like we're like the professor and all

1114
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,159
that stuff was but I've also heard

1115
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,319
people say that there was a guy in

1116
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:59,940
Columbus uh and that's where this whole

1117
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,859
situation happened as well so I'm just

1118
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,639
not 100 sure but that's kind of where

1119
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:08,039
I'm at with the dumpster cool yep how

1120
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:09,838
about the um Afghani mango I know that's

1121
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:14,519
another older classic

1122
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:17,400
oh man yeah any mango Afghan Diego yep I

1123
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,519
got that uh I got that around again

1124
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,260
around mid-2000s uh from my buddy uh it

1125
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,000
was one of his favorite ones and I

1126
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,460
remember going over to his house one day

1127
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,219
he was living up in Akron

1128
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,139
and I walk in and I smell the smell I'm

1129
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:32,939
like man that smells I mean that is

1130
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:34,559
really unique what are you smoking he's

1131
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,599
like I'm smoking Afghan mango and he was

1132
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,019
smoking it out of his Volcano Vaporizer

1133
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,420
oh nice so he gave me some Puffs and I

1134
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:43,739
smoked it and the flavor was

1135
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:48,180
unbelievable it was just like this like

1136
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:50,219
soft mango a little bit of a sweet for

1137
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:53,098
sure a little bit of like metallic smell

1138
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,539
in there as well I feel like yeah it was

1139
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,920
just super interesting and then he you

1140
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:57,539
know brought me upstairs and showed me

1141
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,980
like two or three lights in an upstairs

1142
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,139
bedroom

1143
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,920
a little window AC or something and a

1144
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:04,019
fan

1145
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,519
and he had uh he had it growing up there

1146
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:07,318
and it was just such a unique looking

1147
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,179
plant I I mean I'd really never seen

1148
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,619
anything like it up until this point I

1149
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:12,960
was growing a lot of like kind of more

1150
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:15,240
like Indica dominant stuff whereas The

1151
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,699
Afghani mango is definitely a little bit

1152
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,618
more sativa it makes these long spheres

1153
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:22,559
that kind of like aren't thick but they

1154
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:24,900
fill in they're just like long Spears

1155
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,179
and uh and I ran it for ran it for quite

1156
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,740
a while but it could be finicky uh it

1157
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:30,960
does this weird thing it'll stunt out

1158
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:32,098
sometimes uh like kind of like fail to

1159
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,000
start

1160
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,880
um

1161
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,800
and then it also if if the conditions

1162
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,599
aren't perfect it can tend to like harm

1163
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,160
a lot or like if one plant in the room

1164
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,559
is like buy the fan constantly getting

1165
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:46,559
beat up the whole time like it can hurt

1166
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:48,838
so I never really did large runs of it

1167
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,818
it's been a commercial Ohio strain for a

1168
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:54,119
long time lots of people have done big

1169
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:55,380
big runs of uh Afghan mango and pass it

1170
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,539
around the state over the years and

1171
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,740
stuff but it's just a it's a super

1172
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:01,139
unique one

1173
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:03,838
um I don't know exactly what it is I've

1174
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:05,940
I've you know I've seen uh

1175
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,099
Angel's breath and like I've told you

1176
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,200
before Matt by Mr Nice and Angel heart

1177
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:12,240
and that and it kind of looks very

1178
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,199
similar to that but um I know you've

1179
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,299
mentioned to me that those are

1180
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,179
relatively recent releases within the

1181
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:20,579
past 10 11 years yeah and I've had the

1182
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:22,618
Afghan mango for you know for longer

1183
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:24,240
than that obviously so yeah yeah I guess

1184
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,240
that would you know that would kind of

1185
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:29,098
nullify it but I don't know 100 super

1186
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:30,059
unique plant it's been around Ohio for a

1187
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:33,480
long time

1188
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:36,000
KC 33 maybe always an option

1189
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,000
um KC mango I'm not sure oh yeah the the

1190
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,179
Casey brain stuff yeah you know that's

1191
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,318
older and I mean it was it was grown a

1192
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,118
lot because it was one of the more

1193
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:47,460
affordable lines but there was great

1194
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,380
great stuff in it like amazing stuff in

1195
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,920
it a lot of breeders ended up knocking

1196
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,720
it off later on too uh BC's BC mangoes

1197
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,700
based on that one I'll have to take a

1198
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,858
look into that yeah yeah it might be

1199
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:00,239
another Direction yeah I thought I've

1200
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:01,920
talked to a lot of people you know a lot

1201
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,659
of local people people in the Wii game

1202
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,338
over the years and I always ask about

1203
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,659
Afghan mango because it's one of the

1204
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:08,940
ones that I have the least information

1205
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:10,618
about yeah I don't know who made it I

1206
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,539
don't know if they made it if they

1207
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,000
bought seeds of it from a company when

1208
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:17,099
it came around

1209
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,380
um it's definitely you know early to mid

1210
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,660
2000s areas where I would put it put

1211
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,220
that one we've got to ask Konza where he

1212
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:26,098
sourced his seeds

1213
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:28,259
see if he has any kind of

1214
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,240
anything on it

1215
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,839
have you ever talked to him about it

1216
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,318
no yeah I haven't either ask him no

1217
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:39,059
okay so we go from

1218
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:41,639
we haven't done four-way have we

1219
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:43,858
uh I don't believe we have let's hit

1220
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:47,699
four-way all right

1221
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:50,699
the uh the four-way

1222
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:53,399
I had um I had originally gotten a plant

1223
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:56,759
back in before I don't know the exact

1224
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,619
date 2014 15 16 somewhere around there

1225
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,420
probably

1226
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:02,519
uh I had gotten a plant from

1227
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,039
a friend of a friend and it was called

1228
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:08,940
uh Scentsy star

1229
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:10,559
and I grew it and I realized I had

1230
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,599
smoked this before you know but I

1231
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,400
couldn't it's been so long I couldn't

1232
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,039
tell you know like is this a Scentsy

1233
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,358
star I smoked or you know so so I had

1234
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,219
grown it for years and I had liked it

1235
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,838
and I after growing it a couple times I

1236
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:22,980
really noticed a lot of similarities to

1237
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,099
the Death Star because I think they're

1238
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,440
on Death Star forever yeah uh it kind of

1239
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:31,019
has that like little zigzag uh structure

1240
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,599
it does and some of the Aromas in it as

1241
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:36,179
well kind of uh kind of are very similar

1242
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,099
so you know I actually thought for a

1243
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:40,739
long time that it actually was the the

1244
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:42,599
plant that was used uh to make dust on

1245
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:45,059
our pot sure absolutely

1246
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,818
but uh recently I found you know I was

1247
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:49,380
wrong uh Death Star I've grown test RS

1248
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:52,019
ones and I've definitely seen the S1

1249
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,240
tragedy and it's pretty pretty clear now

1250
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:56,159
that they are uh you know Scentsy

1251
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,479
stardom in it uh

1252
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:59,699
so

1253
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,639
um I feel like it's related the the

1254
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:05,699
four-way my cut what you know is related

1255
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:09,239
somehow whether it's part of Scentsy

1256
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:11,098
star or a component of it was used to

1257
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:14,039
make Sensei star or something like that

1258
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:16,019
you know yeah uh so that's kind of like

1259
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:19,800
that's kind of where I

1260
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:21,838
where I'm at now with with that I I grew

1261
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,900
that Scentsy star for years and then

1262
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,699
eventually along the way I had gotten

1263
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,980
plants under different names

1264
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,539
um such as it's if they were the same

1265
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,280
plant as my Scentsy star I got it under

1266
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,858
the name of death star from some people

1267
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,720
I got it under the name of four-way from

1268
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:38,039
the guy I got it under the name of you

1269
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:39,659
know all this different stuff and every

1270
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:41,699
time over the years I throw it out I'm

1271
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:43,440
like oh my gosh it's the same plan again

1272
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:45,539
like why this is the one that you kept

1273
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,000
getting back it's different oh my gosh

1274
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:49,980
it was it was crazy

1275
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,579
so you know fast forward several years

1276
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:55,980
after that a couple years ago I I was

1277
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:59,039
looking I reached out to a friend of her

1278
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:01,079
of a friend who had a friend

1279
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,739
um who said that they had the Ohio

1280
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:07,260
four-way clone that used to go around

1281
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:09,479
so I I get in contact with him I go over

1282
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,599
to his house and he's a super cool guy a

1283
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,159
little bit older and he shows me a jar

1284
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,619
of the flower and

1285
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,420
and I kind of like you know saw the

1286
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:19,980
resemblance I was like almost like this

1287
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,200
is that same plan again but I wasn't

1288
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,818
sure and then he took me downstairs into

1289
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,618
his little Hut and he had like a light

1290
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,539
with like you know three or four plants

1291
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,818
and they weren't in the best shape they

1292
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:31,559
had some thrips on them and stuff uh but

1293
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:35,338
it just wasn't the best representation

1294
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:37,078
so I wasn't 100 sure yet yeah so um so

1295
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:38,519
anyway he you know he gave me the cut

1296
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,079
and I brought him some stuff too because

1297
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,480
he's from a small circle he doesn't have

1298
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,180
access to a bunch of stuff so sure I

1299
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,740
gave him some cool stuff to grow and I

1300
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:49,259
went and you know grew this thing out

1301
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:50,939
and when we were talking and smoking is

1302
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,579
flour when I met up with him he told me

1303
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,139
that he's had it for 20 years and that

1304
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:57,480
one of his buddies was a guy that bought

1305
00:48:55,139 --> 00:49:00,059
the seeds and made the selection back in

1306
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,240
the day wow yeah and he originally said

1307
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:05,219
uh you know the guy that I met uh that I

1308
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:07,259
got the cut from said that it was from

1309
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:09,419
Scentsy seeds but I had him actually

1310
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,280
contact his buddy the guy who you know

1311
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:14,818
and he confirmed that he said he got him

1312
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,579
from Nirvana oh interesting so yeah

1313
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,480
um so you know

1314
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:20,339
Nirvana's description is slightly

1315
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,139
different from Scentsy seeds but you

1316
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:24,960
know they did a lot of work with other

1317
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:26,940
people's lines back in the day so it

1318
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,920
wouldn't be surprising to me if it was

1319
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,440
more than likely to sensei's work that

1320
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,700
they were using that's probably the most

1321
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,220
you know

1322
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,480
you know and Nirvana was probably I

1323
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,059
probably would have bought Nirvana's

1324
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,059
over scentsies during you know during

1325
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,619
those Early Air that early era because

1326
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:46,500
Nirvana's was always like 90 whereas

1327
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:48,800
since these was like 240 you know is it

1328
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,800
right yeah

1329
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,880
Nirvana verifiably took various lines

1330
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,460
from Scentsy

1331
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,900
um and reprode them and made and gave

1332
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,240
them their own names I mean they

1333
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,539
famously took Neville's nl2 and called

1334
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,159
it Oasis that's the fashion oh that's

1335
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:07,980
Dutch Passion yeah I mean it was it was

1336
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:09,059
very common yeah um and all that and

1337
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,460
then one thing we probably should

1338
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:13,380
mention about the about the Scentsy star

1339
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,119
itself is that even though it came out

1340
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,700
in 1995

1341
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,480
uh we still don't know what the heck it

1342
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:20,059
is

1343
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,119
right yeah

1344
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:28,078
he's he's been extremely uh reluctant to

1345
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:30,539
mention any parentage uh as far as uh

1346
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,460
the guy who owns paradise and you know

1347
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:35,159
what else I found interesting was in 95

1348
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:37,740
Scentsy seeds um re-released the

1349
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,920
four-way uh I don't know what they mean

1350
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:43,019
by that uh but in 1995 they did and then

1351
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,300
a year after in 96 I believe was when

1352
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:47,639
Paradise started and released the

1353
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,900
Scentsy Star right yeah I believe so

1354
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:50,699
that's what was actually released pretty

1355
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,200
pretty close together so yeah I don't

1356
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,299
know I mean you can't prove anything but

1357
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:57,000
you know it's just like I said it's

1358
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,220
possible that uh that four-way was used

1359
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,318
or that one of the components that make

1360
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:03,239
up four-way was possibly used you know

1361
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:05,519
and that's coming through expressing

1362
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:06,899
yeah was was Afghan T in four way it

1363
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,338
took a long time for us to figure out

1364
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,519
and then it was one of those things that

1365
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:14,759
was hiding in plain sight where uh

1366
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,440
Neville wrote in his 87 update to his

1367
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,900
catalog that he was about to release

1368
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,740
this strain called four-way and it was

1369
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:27,000
Big Bud nl1 by early Pearl skunk one

1370
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:28,500
that's right yeah and um and so it was

1371
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,119
another one of those things that like

1372
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,579
pip and I and others we hunted and

1373
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,200
hunted and hunted forever looking for

1374
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:36,539
any information on what would actually

1375
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:37,739
the makeup was

1376
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:39,239
um and then it was one of those things

1377
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:41,519
that was just like hiding in plain sight

1378
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:43,259
if you knew where to look

1379
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,800
um and so it was honestly one of those

1380
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:50,220
like the 90s was a lot of f1s but that

1381
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,940
was an early poly hybrid

1382
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:56,039
um you know because I believe uh I

1383
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,679
believe Neville released both of those

1384
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:01,139
plants that made up four-way as separate

1385
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:04,618
strains big bud nl1 just became the big

1386
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:07,920
bud line and early Pearl skunk one I

1387
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:10,140
believe got released as Early Skunk

1388
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,700
you know so it was already lines he was

1389
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:13,078
playing with separately to begin with

1390
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:14,759
and then he took two of them and

1391
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,559
combined them together yeah and there

1392
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,940
you go and so obviously as a four-way

1393
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,240
hybrid

1394
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,858
um it could lean in different directions

1395
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:25,019
um and especially amongst the progeny

1396
00:52:22,858 --> 00:52:27,960
and stuff like that but

1397
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:30,179
um yeah so I wanted to clarify uh today

1398
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,000
if you go on their website Cincy seeds

1399
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:35,818
labels it as Indian by Afghanistan by

1400
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,260
Pakistan by Skunk one I don't know I

1401
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:39,058
don't I don't know when this was

1402
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,040
released it's not in any of their 90s

1403
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:44,519
catalogs

1404
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:47,639
um but they did use in 1987 Neville did

1405
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:49,318
the up Senate update for his 87 catalog

1406
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:51,118
right and he said he was gonna you know

1407
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:53,279
have a four-way hybrid the next year he

1408
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,140
comes out with four and more and that's

1409
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,140
the only year it comes out and then two

1410
00:52:55,139 --> 00:53:00,719
years go by 89 and 90 and it's not in

1411
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:03,118
the catalog and then in 91 since he sees

1412
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,519
comes along and releases four-way and

1413
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,940
they use the same exact description that

1414
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:11,460
Neville used for his four and more yeah

1415
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,920
same same finish time same verbiage in

1416
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,838
the description

1417
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,480
all that type of stuff so yeah Clues

1418
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:19,799
like that you know um and you know I

1419
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,358
mean we don't know like you know there's

1420
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,940
all there's some other famous cuts out

1421
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,460
there there's the Fairfax four-way that

1422
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,380
supposedly was from the same line

1423
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,179
um but you know obviously like if you

1424
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,500
get a four-way hybrid

1425
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:34,139
um it could lean in a number of

1426
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,519
different directions you know right one

1427
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:37,318
thing I wanted to pull on real quick

1428
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,480
because I wasn't clear on it when you

1429
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:41,579
were talking about the the the the

1430
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,719
bubble Stone are and some of that stuff

1431
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:45,300
yeah

1432
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,578
um was that made with Death Star pollen

1433
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,380
or was that made with pollen from maybe

1434
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:52,160
like the East Coast Sour Diesel that

1435
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:55,079
threw on some of those other plants

1436
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:57,058
it was the Scentsy star that threw it

1437
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:01,019
was the Sensei so the Scentsy star was

1438
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:03,960
the was the the dad if you will yes the

1439
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:05,699
Scentsy the Scentsy star threw the

1440
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,338
Scentsy star through okay so that's

1441
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:09,899
where that's where bubbles star and some

1442
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:11,759
of those other hybrids you were talking

1443
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,318
about that you would see floating around

1444
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,839
came from

1445
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:17,219
uh yeah it definitely can I feel like it

1446
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,039
definitely came from that same

1447
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:22,259
accidental pollination or if I don't say

1448
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,460
accidental I've heard that they saw that

1449
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,500
the Scentsy star was kind of making

1450
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,240
pollen and they kind of used it and

1451
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:31,619
sprinkled it is what I've heard as well

1452
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:34,618
who knows what happened but um but yeah

1453
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:37,619
early feminized seed used to be like you

1454
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:40,619
know uh you know you know plant gets

1455
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,760
stressed accidental pollen flies and

1456
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:44,640
then all of a sudden you have some

1457
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,920
feminized backseat long before we

1458
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:48,838
figured out STS or any of these other

1459
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,180
methods that modern where you're using

1460
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:52,980
in modern times

1461
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:54,960
you know

1462
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,719
I don't know Matt's smiling over there

1463
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,059
or whatever but

1464
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:02,459
but yeah I mean you know for old people

1465
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:04,619
like me we used to think that that

1466
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,300
accidental pollination like if you use

1467
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:08,220
that you were cheating and it would

1468
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,980
probably ruin the line because it was

1469
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:13,019
made not the natural way that was a big

1470
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,639
belief back in the day it was a big

1471
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:16,920
belief you're like oh you're going to

1472
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:18,960
use some Herm accident stuff you're

1473
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,639
gonna probably like imprint that into

1474
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,720
your seed line and you'll never get it

1475
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,719
out and it'll be worse

1476
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,639
um so that just goes to show how

1477
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:29,400
ignorant we were at the time we were

1478
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:32,279
convinced that you know that huh yeah

1479
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,559
the other day Caleb made a post and I

1480
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,900
it drives me nuts absolutely nuts when I

1481
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,240
see this but it's the typical what I

1482
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:42,180
call the typical hippie response to like

1483
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:45,118
a feminized seed post is like ha see

1484
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:48,179
like it was it was CSI posting about a a

1485
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,800
reversal failure right huh because

1486
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:51,539
because you were you were messing with

1487
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,240
nature that's what what happened there

1488
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:57,599
and then I had to point out you know the

1489
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,639
nature wants these plants intersex it's

1490
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:03,780
because man's intervened that they're

1491
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:05,460
regular seeds so actually actually if

1492
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,380
you really want to get technical they're

1493
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,780
taking it back and it's just like this

1494
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:11,640
really bad logical argument that they

1495
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:15,559
seem to have in their heads that

1496
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:18,358
herming is us being bad

1497
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:19,339
weed used to be very Bro Science

1498
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:22,019
yeah

1499
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:23,639
there used to be a lot of Bro Science

1500
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:25,858
and what I mean by that is just stuff

1501
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:28,259
that gets passed around in smoking

1502
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:30,119
circles and stuff like that and I mean

1503
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,500
I've talked about it on previous shows

1504
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,140
where we used to put our best Mexican

1505
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:36,920
butt in the resin chamber so it would

1506
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:36,920
gain equality

1507
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:42,960
Mexican butt in your resin chamber and

1508
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:44,879
you don't smoke that until the end and

1509
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,920
then you hold on this butt out and you

1510
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,200
thought that was an improvement so there

1511
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,300
was a lot of of misinformation in the

1512
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:54,480
90s and early 2000s when the internet

1513
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:56,180
and and sort of like you know facts it

1514
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,318
was basically just a bunch of kids

1515
00:56:56,179 --> 00:57:00,480
spreading what they heard from older

1516
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:03,058
people maybe or reading in High Times

1517
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,838
you know we used to think High Times was

1518
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:05,839
sort of the Bible

1519
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:10,858
and then you get older and you're like

1520
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,720
oh man who takes that advice

1521
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:14,519
but it was a real error in that regard

1522
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:15,838
so

1523
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:19,920
you know

1524
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:21,299
um yeah so I mean four-way uh you know

1525
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,220
it it ended up being one of your

1526
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,039
favorite plants

1527
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:27,899
it did man it's uh it's just you know

1528
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:29,400
super unique super old school you can

1529
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,720
tell if you've been growing a lot of

1530
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,818
plants you can grow it and look at it

1531
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,639
and be like yeah that's definitely

1532
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:36,480
not from around this time period you

1533
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:38,219
know

1534
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,480
um definitely some like 90s weed

1535
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:41,098
something like that I wasn't really

1536
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,780
growing or smoking in the 80s so I

1537
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,059
didn't see a lot of that stuff

1538
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,440
but I've seen enough stuff from you know

1539
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:48,300
back in the day to know when something's

1540
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,760
a little bit older and you know

1541
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,559
different than

1542
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,619
would you say that the the four-way the

1543
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,240
Ohio four-way is skunky at all yes

1544
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:59,640
that's interesting because that that

1545
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:01,919
Fairfax four-way like the one time when

1546
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:03,838
I got to because it was super dudded and

1547
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,300
I got it but um

1548
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:07,980
the one time I got to like get any hint

1549
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,660
of smell out of it you could smell like

1550
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,159
what direction it was going it's like oh

1551
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:12,838
wow this does have potential to be as

1552
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:14,699
skunky as they've talked about it really

1553
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:19,139
does so I was wondering if the other

1554
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:21,480
it's cut does it's the I don't know the

1555
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:23,338
the four-way that I have is it's not as

1556
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,619
skunky as like the Death Star you know

1557
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:28,380
it doesn't it's not like that uh it's

1558
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:30,780
it's milder than the Death Star yeah but

1559
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,640
it's got more like other stuff in it you

1560
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,400
know it's like that like

1561
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:37,500
I don't know how to that old world likes

1562
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:41,220
those old world smells you know like

1563
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:43,318
kind of stuff like that hashy spicy uh

1564
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:46,318
you know skunky

1565
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:48,659
stuff going on in there yeah definitely

1566
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,519
the one the other one was like um had

1567
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:51,838
oniony in it too that was the other

1568
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:54,000
smell I could really smell yeah

1569
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,338
definitely but there's some stuff about

1570
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,559
that four-way certain things about it

1571
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:00,659
that remind me of stuff you'd see from

1572
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,760
afghanista so I always found that

1573
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:05,219
interesting based on what's in it

1574
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,200
I don't really see Afghan t in it unless

1575
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:08,639
Afghan teas and skunk wand or something

1576
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,058
like that which is something that I'd

1577
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:15,179
always like to dig further into

1578
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:16,859
yeah I mean it it uh it was it was one

1579
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:19,798
of those confusing things for a really

1580
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:21,598
long time because Neville was one of the

1581
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:24,298
only guys that just sort of laid out

1582
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,980
what was in his stuff all that second

1583
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:28,380
wave of breeders pretty much

1584
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:31,798
intentionally obscured

1585
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:34,079
uh genetics which were like his people

1586
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:35,940
like us who are a little younger younger

1587
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,460
than that and historians trying to

1588
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,559
figure out what they used

1589
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,000
um even 25 30 years later some of those

1590
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,920
people don't want to just come off it

1591
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,619
like what would it what would it matter

1592
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,358
if Luke came out and you know and said

1593
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:53,220
this is what I used to make Scentsy star

1594
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:55,739
in 1995. yeah I don't know you know like

1595
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:58,078
big secret oh can't let that out you

1596
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:00,419
know like and but to this day it's still

1597
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,180
kind of like ah what's it what is it you

1598
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:05,760
know as of this year as recent as this

1599
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:07,679
year he will not say unfortunately I I'd

1600
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,960
love to have him on to to talk about it

1601
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,000
but yeah we've been getting declined

1602
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,740
that's that's been around Robin and you

1603
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,119
know it's one of those things where for

1604
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:17,039
a lot of people it's like if it doesn't

1605
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,260
benefit me why would I say it and it's

1606
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,818
like do I want to say that I like ripped

1607
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,200
it off from Neville or I got it from

1608
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:25,440
this other person that I never gave

1609
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:27,838
credit to or whatever the story may or

1610
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,980
may not be they'd prefer it to remain a

1611
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:30,298
mystery

1612
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,400
because it's not like anyone's going to

1613
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:34,619
go and like find the parents 25 years

1614
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,700
later 30 years later and like recreate

1615
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:38,039
it

1616
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:41,039
I mean that ship has sailed while we're

1617
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:45,358
in this territory let's hit my personal

1618
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:47,279
favorite the one like the the the bug

1619
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:50,578
that made me fall in love with pips

1620
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:54,140
grows the silver Pearl let's talk about

1621
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:54,140
that girl where did she come from

1622
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:59,159
um

1623
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:01,440
uh the silver Pearl uh came from a local

1624
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,899
guy that actually got a hold of me on IG

1625
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,639
I think I met him I think we have a

1626
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:09,720
mutual friend as well

1627
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:11,578
um at the time and uh I'm not going to

1628
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:14,058
say either their names but sure yeah

1629
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:16,500
that's that's who I received it from uh

1630
01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:18,960
prefaces saying like our group has had

1631
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,699
this clone for a long time back in the

1632
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,619
day and I never grew it because I was so

1633
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:24,838
busy tied up with lemon G and death star

1634
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:26,760
like that was my yeah my show that was

1635
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:28,380
my Mo so like I didn't have time for

1636
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,819
anything else I already had 10 or 12

1637
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,818
plants that was more than enough for me

1638
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:34,440
being a Cropper yeah

1639
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:35,759
uh so I kind of always passed on I would

1640
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,079
smoke it you know my friends would have

1641
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,700
it they'd bring it over and they'd bring

1642
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,200
it to our little you know cannabis cups

1643
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:42,960
that we had and stuff back in the day

1644
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:45,000
yeah up here in Akron

1645
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,858
um but I never really grew it and then

1646
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,659
as we got older you know how things go

1647
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:51,838
stuff gets lost it's not in the circle

1648
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:53,940
anymore and uh and I wanted to give it a

1649
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,159
riff so you know I was able to get in

1650
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:57,599
touch with this guy and he uh he had

1651
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,838
gotten it from an older gentleman who

1652
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:03,240
lived down Southern Ohio I believe

1653
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:05,460
and had it for quite a while and then uh

1654
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:07,199
you know I eventually acquired it from

1655
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:10,380
him you know gave him some stuff some

1656
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:12,719
seeds and I forget what else but uh it

1657
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:15,059
was it and a funny story is like a week

1658
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:16,500
later I got another plant uh that I was

1659
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,660
looking for I was looking for that G13

1660
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,460
we were talking about earlier and

1661
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:22,019
someone gave it to me and I grew it up

1662
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,880
and I knew it before I even flowered it

1663
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:25,858
it was silver Pearl so I got silver

1664
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,660
Pearl twice in the same week from her

1665
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:29,880
basically different people from

1666
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:31,739
different people yeah

1667
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,900
one thing I'll say that's interesting

1668
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:37,439
about that cut is that and not

1669
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:40,380
everything does this but that cut grown

1670
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,318
out looks amazingly like some of the

1671
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,519
oldest pictures of silver Pearl that you

1672
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:46,318
can find I mean you know you don't want

1673
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:49,739
to use the word dead ringer too much or

1674
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:52,500
anything like that but boy uh visually

1675
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:54,239
does it look like it's it's just you

1676
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,519
know just walked out of the catalog and

1677
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:59,039
into your collection it really does it

1678
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,139
looks like if you were to look at at

1679
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,239
hips silver Pearl cut and you were to

1680
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:05,279
look at some of those old pictures of

1681
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:07,199
silver Pearl and you didn't know which

1682
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,960
was which you'd have a hard time telling

1683
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:12,480
the difference in some ways uh it really

1684
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,639
looks it really it really does resemble

1685
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,119
so that's not proof or anything like

1686
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:19,980
that but it certainly helps right right

1687
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,240
uh you know silver Pearl is just such a

1688
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,159
special plant

1689
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:25,979
um it's not like a narcotic hitter like

1690
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:27,719
I I prefer uh I respect all cannabis

1691
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,519
regardless of whether I enjoy it or not

1692
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:30,779
you know I gave it all a chance I enjoy

1693
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:32,519
all the different different aspects of

1694
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:35,280
it even if I'm not smoking yet you know

1695
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:37,858
yeah but but the silver Pearl really

1696
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:41,040
grew on me uh when I first smoked it I

1697
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:42,598
was kind of I don't know off put by it

1698
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,699
because I wanted something you know hard

1699
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:46,200
hitting but after after smoking it for a

1700
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:47,818
while I'm giving it a chance and seeing

1701
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:50,039
what it's really about

1702
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:52,079
uh you know smoking it fresh when you

1703
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:54,539
wake up in the morning uh you know

1704
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,480
nothing in your system you're fresh uh

1705
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:59,960
it's just I mean it's amazing it's

1706
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:04,318
really just really uplifting motivating

1707
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:05,940
happy you know bright Buzz uh on a you

1708
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:07,558
know it's it's very more of like a city

1709
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,200
it's almost like what you think of like

1710
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:12,240
a sativa right but on a plant that's

1711
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:16,019
short and squat and finishes in you know

1712
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:18,479
50 days yeah yeah so it's I call the

1713
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:21,298
high electric maybe not not in the sense

1714
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,880
that it's um like giving you a rush but

1715
01:04:21,298 --> 01:04:25,199
it's bright and happy to me very bright

1716
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,358
and happy is the best way I could

1717
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:29,460
describe it in the in the the scent

1718
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:32,639
profile like me and not so describe it

1719
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,900
completely opposite and and it's really

1720
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:35,460
just two different takes on it but it's

1721
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,818
because of how complex it is how would

1722
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:41,338
you describe it

1723
01:04:37,818 --> 01:04:43,199
oh uh I have a description I wrote of it

1724
01:04:41,338 --> 01:04:45,719
somewhere I'll try to remember some but

1725
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:49,199
it's the basic smells are it's it's like

1726
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:51,179
a uh it's kind of like a sweet melon

1727
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,338
it's got a little bit of baby poo in

1728
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:55,858
there like that funk it's got the like

1729
01:04:53,338 --> 01:04:59,519
the funky Funk foot funk I guess a

1730
01:04:55,858 --> 01:05:01,259
little bit type thing it's got uh some

1731
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:06,380
like anise like almost like a black

1732
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:06,380
licorice type you know thing

1733
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,760
yeah yeah I know like yeah I see for me

1734
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:16,680
when I smell it I smell like

1735
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,339
pink bubble gum is the first smell I

1736
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:21,838
smell and oh yeah D just grew it outdoor

1737
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:23,699
and I smelled it and I smelled it again

1738
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,619
and the first smell I smell is pink

1739
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:28,379
bubble gum but then there's like funky

1740
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:30,780
skunk background but not white it's just

1741
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:32,338
yeah it's got so much going on Matt that

1742
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:34,380
confuses a lot of people a lot of people

1743
01:05:32,338 --> 01:05:37,078
have a hard time really like nailing it

1744
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:39,180
uh because there's just so much there's

1745
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:41,339
so much to it it's not like some of

1746
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:42,659
these there's just so many different I

1747
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:44,759
mean you can sit there and smell it for

1748
01:05:42,659 --> 01:05:45,539
10 minutes straight and and pick out all

1749
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,059
the different

1750
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:50,519
it's uh it's just really really unique

1751
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:53,040
really awesome you know short flowering

1752
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:55,199
Indica like I said 50 days not the

1753
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,239
biggest yield or in the world uh you

1754
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,919
gotta defoliate it it's a little bit you

1755
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:01,500
know like yeah throws fan leaves

1756
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,358
everywhere big fat indica and but it's

1757
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,099
gotta be great yeah got a great

1758
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,900
structure and you don't even have to I

1759
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:08,460
don't think I've ever netted or staked a

1760
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,318
silver Pearl plant in my life regardless

1761
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,059
of how big it's been I mean I grew up

1762
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:14,579
into like five gallons I don't go bigger

1763
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:16,260
than that but you know they it just so

1764
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:17,940
they support themselves like you don't

1765
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:20,520
even have to mess with them at all so

1766
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:22,679
good outdoor stuff uh one of the things

1767
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:25,079
that's interesting about it is that

1768
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:28,858
because pip mentioned it is that when he

1769
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:31,559
says baby poo I also get a strong baby

1770
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:35,098
poo smell off it but just to clarify

1771
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:37,680
like it smells to me like infant baby

1772
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:39,960
poo like when all their all they're on

1773
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,460
is Mother's Milk like they haven't

1774
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,559
gotten any kind of real food like

1775
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:47,240
because I I have a number of kids or

1776
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:47,240
whatever so like you know you

1777
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:52,260
but there's a very different smell to

1778
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:53,879
baby poo when they're one two three four

1779
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:56,280
months old whatever and all they're

1780
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,920
eating is Mommy's milk right then when

1781
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,319
they get actual real food so it doesn't

1782
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:04,858
smell like some kind of like gnarly kid

1783
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:06,179
poop it smells like this weird it's

1784
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:08,038
almost like one of those things to me

1785
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:09,480
where like if it wasn't in cannabis you

1786
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:10,319
would guarantee say it doesn't smell

1787
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,599
good

1788
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:14,338
but there's like smells in cannabis that

1789
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:17,099
smell weird but you like them but

1790
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:22,199
they're in weed and it's kind of caught

1791
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:23,280
that skunky sweet sickly baby poo and it

1792
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:25,500
doesn't sound maybe that doesn't sound

1793
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,260
too appetizing but it really is

1794
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,940
no I think it's a beautiful smell there

1795
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:32,160
is in the progeny

1796
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:34,200
um there is a little bit of mint and I

1797
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:37,139
can smell a slight hint of it in the mom

1798
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:39,538
but I got some nice uh nice selections I

1799
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:42,000
made that are like extremely like super

1800
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:43,740
minty you know wow it was uh it really

1801
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,239
you know threw me off guard surprised me

1802
01:07:43,739 --> 01:07:47,519
I also think it smells like a little bit

1803
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:50,519
some of them like like a Melanie a melon

1804
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:52,980
kind of you know uh it's just I mean

1805
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:54,780
it's got a lot going on man so what

1806
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:58,798
silver Pro is supposed to be according

1807
01:07:54,780 --> 01:08:02,160
to Neville is nl5 uh female the famous

1808
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:05,400
clone crossed with uh early Pearl skunk

1809
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:08,519
one male right and that is silver Pearl

1810
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,200
I mean I go ahead go ahead and one of

1811
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:13,440
the things since we were just talking

1812
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:15,298
about four-way I don't have any proof

1813
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,000
um I don't know how many different males

1814
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:19,198
Neville decided to use of early Pearl

1815
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,619
skunk one

1816
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:25,500
but it's somewhat possible that it could

1817
01:08:22,619 --> 01:08:27,778
have the same dad as four-way it I mean

1818
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,420
anything's possible man you know because

1819
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:33,239
it's like it it's the same mix from the

1820
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,819
same guy yeah it's you know the dad is

1821
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:37,858
early Pearl skunk one in both the

1822
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:41,580
hybrids is it a different male but it's

1823
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:44,338
definitely the same line you know

1824
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:48,000
and that early Pearl is uh Early Girl

1825
01:08:44,338 --> 01:08:50,219
across with Pollyanna yeah um

1826
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,539
and that that's you know that's what you

1827
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:54,179
know they used to cross I thought it was

1828
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:55,500
the nl5 nl5 skunk one male I had it

1829
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:58,940
written down like that because I wasn't

1830
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,939
able to find exactly

1831
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:13,139
it's the nl5 by by early Pearl skunk one

1832
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:15,900
you know so it's a three-way hybrid uh

1833
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,219
silver Pearl and what's interesting is

1834
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:19,379
since Matt and I have been kind of doing

1835
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:21,899
a deep dive on some of the Early Girl

1836
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,600
early Pearl stuff is you don't really

1837
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:26,278
realize it but secretly it was one of

1838
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,900
the most common things Neville used

1839
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:32,400
throughout his lines

1840
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:34,318
he loved it he loved that early Pearl he

1841
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,599
loved he loved mixing it into different

1842
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,580
stuff and so it's it doesn't really get

1843
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,960
talked about that much but it was one of

1844
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:41,880
his favorites

1845
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,739
and where did the early girl come from

1846
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:48,000
Northern California Northern California

1847
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:50,039
yeah and Pollyanna was huh we just

1848
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,500
recently found out

1849
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:54,298
um that one of them one of them I can't

1850
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,340
remember if it's early girl or Pollyanna

1851
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:58,380
I think it was Pollyanna

1852
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:01,140
I mean it was early girl one of them is

1853
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:04,260
not from Rob or Sam and I always thought

1854
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:05,760
both were from Rob Rob yeah no that's

1855
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,179
the there's a lot of assumptions so

1856
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,920
early girl I believe is a is an Afghan

1857
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:13,079
Mexican

1858
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,880
and then they took that and they crossed

1859
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:17,760
that to Pollyanna which is an early

1860
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,859
Colombian by Mexican and that's early

1861
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,739
Pearl

1862
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:25,979
um and we also learned that that

1863
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:27,599
sweetness uh is very was very prevalent

1864
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:30,599
in the early Pearl and it was one of

1865
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,000
Neville's favorite things and he wanted

1866
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,120
to recreate it really badly later in his

1867
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,859
life because

1868
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:41,099
he really enjoyed sort of that double

1869
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:44,158
Mexican Afghan blend that was early

1870
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:46,079
Pearl and that's why it showed up in so

1871
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,719
many different hybrids he had

1872
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:51,119
and later in the night later in life he

1873
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,980
was working a specific oaxacan line I

1874
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:56,460
don't remember where he sourced it from

1875
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:58,259
specifically it was later but um he felt

1876
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,760
that that was very similar to what he

1877
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:02,579
saw in the early Pearl if I remember

1878
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,560
correctly and this is there's a there's

1879
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:07,559
a gentleman that that Matt and I chat

1880
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,800
with on IG

1881
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:14,159
um and he his family used to grow early

1882
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,380
Pearl in the 90s for about five years uh

1883
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:19,259
up in my neck of the woods and he's been

1884
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:22,980
kind of on the hunt to find he got lost

1885
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:24,659
in a bus sadly but he did say pip he he

1886
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:27,658
sent me not knowing that we're buddies

1887
01:11:24,658 --> 01:11:30,000
he sent me this pic you had posted a

1888
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:32,039
number of years ago of an early of a

1889
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,560
silver Pearl S1

1890
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:35,819
and he goes man does this look like my

1891
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:42,360
parents plant

1892
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:44,158
oh boy he did he did you know so uh take

1893
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:46,319
that for what it's worth but he go but

1894
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:47,939
there was uh yeah he showed me this

1895
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,399
picture and it's from you you know and

1896
01:11:47,939 --> 01:11:54,299
he's like this one really looks like my

1897
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:56,579
parents old cut of early Pearl so who

1898
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,800
knows you know yeah you never know I

1899
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:00,539
mean it's it's it's it's pretty unique

1900
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,039
plant once you've been around it and

1901
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:03,600
you've seen some progeny you could kind

1902
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:05,819
of tell

1903
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,039
um you know what's related if it's

1904
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:10,259
related or not so I have no doubt that

1905
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:12,119
you know that's what he had and he

1906
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,800
thought that mine looked like his

1907
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:17,039
and it's also one of the rare things

1908
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:19,560
that pip doesn't take 84 days it doesn't

1909
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:21,300
take 84 days it's done before most of my

1910
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:24,780
plants are even halfway done flowering

1911
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:26,219
yeah it's so 50 55 or something like

1912
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:28,319
that it's like I mean you could pull it

1913
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:30,300
before 50 if you wanted to it's just uh

1914
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,619
it's it's so quick I feel like I throw

1915
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,719
it in the flower room and feed it for

1916
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:35,640
two weeks and then you know so it's like

1917
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:38,520
it's basically like a true seven weeker

1918
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,420
yeah oh man it's super quick yeah super

1919
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,520
quick

1920
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:43,619
I mean some of them go into the 50s you

1921
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:47,340
know 55 days or whatever but some of the

1922
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:49,979
progeny was done in 46 47 days you could

1923
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:52,140
probably pull it 45 if you lived in 1990

1924
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:53,819
like they always like yeah yeah you know

1925
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,679
you see these seed descriptions and

1926
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:59,399
flowering times and you're like oh it's

1927
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:02,158
done in you know 60 days Freedom 35 bro

1928
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:05,039
I mean what was the flowering time on

1929
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:07,799
Super Skunk I remember being in a kid 49

1930
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:10,140
49 you know just getting started on

1931
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,539
indoor and seeing those 50-day strains

1932
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:15,980
and being like I could get eight crops a

1933
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:15,979
year yeah yeah

1934
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:20,759
it was super enticing you know you're

1935
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:22,559
just thinking oh my gosh

1936
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,940
uh I didn't realize that it was a bit it

1937
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,800
was a bit of marketing back then

1938
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:27,479
claiming everything took six or seven

1939
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,100
weeks but

1940
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:31,079
um you know it was and then I realized

1941
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:33,179
how rare it was to find something that

1942
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:36,719
developed that quickly that I actually

1943
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:41,579
liked right so um so we got through uh

1944
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:45,619
the Ode to Neville let's get to q36

1945
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:48,179
oh boy excuse me

1946
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:49,859
q36 is a wild one

1947
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:54,420
um again I don't have an exact date but

1948
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:56,460
it's somewhere like 2010 11. ish 2009 to

1949
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:59,399
2011. somewhere in there I would

1950
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:01,079
probably put it uh so it's relatively

1951
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:04,079
kind of like new kid on the block out

1952
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:06,600
here uh for Ohio

1953
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,779
and it's uh when I first got it it was

1954
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,840
in like 28

1955
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:13,679
2013 14. I don't know I I'd have to look

1956
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,739
but

1957
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,239
it's uh it when I first got that thing I

1958
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:19,500
couldn't believe it it I was looking at

1959
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:21,419
the leaves on the thing it looked like

1960
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:23,399
it was like came out of the Jurassic

1961
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:26,579
period or something you know dinosaurs

1962
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:29,519
walking around so I mean super weird uh

1963
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:32,519
super dark Afghani like super unique

1964
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,920
Leaf shape and um so I've you know

1965
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:37,380
vegged it up and I flowered it out and

1966
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,239
it's definitely I could tell immediately

1967
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:41,699
it was definitely related to Bubba but

1968
01:14:39,238 --> 01:14:43,859
it's not like anything that I've seen

1969
01:14:41,698 --> 01:14:45,960
crossed with Bubba before I don't they

1970
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:48,059
say the lineage is it's basically Bubba

1971
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:50,158
Kush cross with Hawaiian indica and

1972
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:52,260
there was there was some work done

1973
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:54,899
um in that line they they had spread

1974
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:57,900
that line together uh a second time the

1975
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:59,399
f2s or the dx2s or whatever they did uh

1976
01:14:57,899 --> 01:15:00,899
they had a plant called the nuke that

1977
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:02,698
went around for a while

1978
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:04,379
and it was decent

1979
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:06,238
um but eventually that kind of got

1980
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:10,020
thrown to the side once they used the

1981
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:13,079
nuke to make the Next Generation that

1982
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:15,000
you know the q36 came from ultimately

1983
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:16,319
yeah and that thing just blew everything

1984
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,819
out of the water so that nuke everybody

1985
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,639
kind of like threw that to the Wayside

1986
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:22,500
and just focused on the q36 so it's like

1987
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,719
a Bubba

1988
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,179
like a Bubba Kush but it's like cream

1989
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:29,100
like super creamy Bubba yeah it doesn't

1990
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:31,440
it doesn't have like typical Bubba

1991
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:36,480
leaves it's got these short little like

1992
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:37,919
like uh almost like uh like Clover or I

1993
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,779
I don't know how to describe it they're

1994
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,520
they're very they're just very unique I

1995
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:43,259
have pictures on my Instagram page if

1996
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,140
you want to look

1997
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:48,539
um the the resident it just pumps out

1998
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:50,400
resin it I mean almost looks like a like

1999
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:52,198
a like one of these hype strains that

2000
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:54,658
you see now it's just so Caked Up in

2001
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:56,279
resin yeah um the smaller plants don't

2002
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:57,899
tend to yield too well but when I put

2003
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:59,399
them in like three gallons or five

2004
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:01,920
gallons and got them nice and vegged up

2005
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:04,920
they do pretty good yielding it smells

2006
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,800
like creamy Bubba and anise like that uh

2007
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:10,500
again like a black licorice type like

2008
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:12,659
thing in there as well yeah and it's uh

2009
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:15,300
it's a low it's a low tester it tests at

2010
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:16,738
like 15 I think my buddies some people

2011
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:20,219
have had it tested a little bit higher

2012
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:22,979
but generally test below 20 but it is

2013
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:25,500
very just like Bubba very medical very

2014
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:28,500
good good effect it's definitely smokes

2015
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:32,100
like it's over 20 percent uh the flavor

2016
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:34,020
is phenomenal like I said creamy Bubba

2017
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,940
um like if you're a Bubba lover like

2018
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:38,460
this one is the this is the ultimate

2019
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:39,599
it's like Primo Bubba yeah oh dude I

2020
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,880
mean it is

2021
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,340
pip has shared it in our little tight

2022
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:46,440
circle of friends and I would say almost

2023
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:48,600
universally

2024
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:51,779
um everyone regards it almost as an

2025
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,239
improved Bubba yeah you know like better

2026
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:56,639
maybe even maybe even better than Bubba

2027
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:57,839
would be a way to describe it like you

2028
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,360
know like everything they like about

2029
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,960
Bubba and more right that's exactly yeah

2030
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:05,519
that's how I would say it and More

2031
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,500
Everything more

2032
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,940
whatever kind of if you don't hit it

2033
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,198
right it doesn't really turn out well it

2034
01:17:08,939 --> 01:17:12,178
doesn't yield well it's a little bit

2035
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:15,419
leafy and it can come out a little bit

2036
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:17,760
like soapy sometimes I feel like so

2037
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:19,319
uh this plant there's none of that you

2038
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,119
don't I mean even if you run it bad it's

2039
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:23,698
not coming out soapy it's not coming out

2040
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:25,198
crappy like it's still gonna do good so

2041
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:27,000
it's definitely like an improvement I

2042
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:29,460
mean I wouldn't call it above like a

2043
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,500
bubba cut right but it's uh it's

2044
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:34,439
definitely like a newer age version of

2045
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:37,079
like Bubba Kush that's the fire yeah uh

2046
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:38,639
improved improved version of the Bubba

2047
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:40,019
so

2048
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,640
the only reason why I say that is

2049
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,760
because most people that really love to

2050
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:46,739
grow Bubba for their head end up growing

2051
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:50,100
q36 for their head

2052
01:17:46,738 --> 01:17:52,259
and being totally happy with that plant

2053
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,699
and not having to grow Bubba for their

2054
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:56,340
head because they get everything they

2055
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:58,859
like about Bubba right and and a little

2056
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:01,380
bit more from it so and just pretty High

2057
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:03,059
Praise really and just to clarify a lot

2058
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:06,119
of people get confused the uh the

2059
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:09,179
eludium is the q36 it's this it's the Q3

2060
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:11,279
eludium q36 space modulator it's the

2061
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:13,100
mark the gun or the Marvin the Martian

2062
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:15,479
used to use on the cartoon

2063
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:19,140
so that's the full name is you know

2064
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:22,019
eludium Q3 36 space modulator there you

2065
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:23,520
go there you go um and what was it um

2066
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,739
there was a weird breeding trait that I

2067
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,719
had where uh something about seed making

2068
01:18:25,738 --> 01:18:29,299
how it makes seeds yeah it doesn't make

2069
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:31,920
seeds I've tried to seed the thing

2070
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:35,100
numerous times and the same thing

2071
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:38,819
happens I get you know 20 maybe if I'm

2072
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:41,820
lucky 30 40 seeds out of each pound uh

2073
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:44,939
30 of them are premature fully like big

2074
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:46,679
seeds but just white and Hollow and um

2075
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:48,599
and then the other ones some are made

2076
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:50,279
mutated and then you sprout what you

2077
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,260
have left from that you know whatever 10

2078
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:55,500
or 12 seeds you get out of that

2079
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:59,280
15 maybe and you sprout them and then

2080
01:18:55,500 --> 01:19:01,319
summer are are

2081
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:04,259
like Newton like super mutant there's

2082
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:07,079
like maybe 25 30 of them from what I've

2083
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:10,260
seen yeah have been like mutant or runty

2084
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:13,019
or slow you know and then a small

2085
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:16,980
percentage of them though are

2086
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:19,620
are really nice I bet so it's been it's

2087
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:21,539
it's a lot it's a tough pill to swallow

2088
01:19:19,619 --> 01:19:23,819
when you try to pollinate a plant and

2089
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:26,158
you got to rip apart a pound of weed to

2090
01:19:23,819 --> 01:19:28,139
get you know 10 or 15 seeds that you can

2091
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,000
grow and then only a quarter of those

2092
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,380
are going to be something decent and

2093
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,238
only a percentage of those are going to

2094
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:35,400
be something amazing yeah by the time

2095
01:19:33,238 --> 01:19:37,319
you were done slicing and dicing how

2096
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:40,319
much came out I was thinking to myself

2097
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:42,658
so he gets five seeds he likes I did

2098
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:47,340
cross it to the silver Pearl

2099
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:49,198
and I grew those seeds and I did find an

2100
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,300
awesome selection a really really

2101
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:53,279
awesome selection and it kind of made it

2102
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,640
worth it for me I posted it on my

2103
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:58,439
Instagram page it says it make seeds

2104
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:01,260
extremely resinous

2105
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:04,259
um yeah

2106
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:07,739
yeah it does so

2107
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:09,659
um it's extremely resinous uh maybe even

2108
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:11,459
more so than the q36 it's just

2109
01:20:09,658 --> 01:20:13,139
absolutely caked on there I'll get that

2110
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:14,760
picture over to you as well Matt yeah

2111
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,780
yeah

2112
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,119
um

2113
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:20,158
but I I made two selections they're both

2114
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:22,859
very nice one is just super unique it

2115
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:26,039
kind of has the uh I like that that like

2116
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:28,198
black licorice like like anise or I

2117
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:30,899
don't know how you pronounce it but I

2118
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:34,259
like that and stuff and I like it in the

2119
01:20:30,899 --> 01:20:37,259
q36 and the the so one of the selections

2120
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:39,239
I made has it's kind of like a lot of

2121
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:41,340
that and less of like the other aspects

2122
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:43,559
it's kind of like focused in onto it and

2123
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,360
it's not like the most ideal plant it's

2124
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,400
not a huge yield or it's kind of wiry

2125
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,259
but it's got good flour and it's got

2126
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:52,198
that flavor and that smell and that

2127
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:54,000
taste that I like so I keep it around

2128
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:57,059
I don't think a lot of people understand

2129
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,399
that too when it comes to reversals

2130
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:01,500
um is that uh because there's other

2131
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:03,479
things you've done too like with your

2132
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:06,600
East Coast Sour Diesel cut reversing it

2133
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:09,119
where like it works but it doesn't

2134
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:11,039
really give you enough seed that you can

2135
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:14,760
like even share it with friends it's

2136
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:17,158
almost like you it it gives you 15 or 30

2137
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,079
or 40 seeds or something so you can't

2138
01:21:17,158 --> 01:21:21,119
even make it happen yeah you can't make

2139
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:23,399
packs of it it's like even difficult to

2140
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:26,640
share with homies because you get so few

2141
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:28,319
and it took so much effort to do

2142
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,780
um so there's just certain varieties out

2143
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:34,259
there that for whatever reason don't

2144
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:36,960
don't reverse well or don't take seed

2145
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:40,400
don't take pollination well and it makes

2146
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,399
it really hard to make hybrids with them

2147
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,380
you know now speaking of hybrid making

2148
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:50,939
let's get into where you're at now where

2149
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:53,579
where you're at currently as of the time

2150
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:57,479
this podcast is gonna air

2151
01:21:53,579 --> 01:21:59,179
where I'm at in my seed making yeah

2152
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:02,519
uh well

2153
01:21:59,179 --> 01:22:05,520
I am at a uh the point where I have

2154
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:07,380
already made the Rubber City and I did a

2155
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,940
rigorous selection process trying to

2156
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,699
narrow down what I feel like we're the

2157
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:13,619
best plants out of that run yeah and um

2158
01:22:11,698 --> 01:22:15,299
and I've grown them and cropped them and

2159
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:17,399
just done everything I could to really

2160
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:20,640
like make sure that what I want what I

2161
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:23,579
want to use and uh and then I have uh I

2162
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,079
I the one is the Ten the Rubber City

2163
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:27,600
number 10 and the other one is the River

2164
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:29,519
City number four so maybe before you go

2165
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:32,579
any further just talk for a second about

2166
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,199
what made the Rubber City okay yeah that

2167
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:38,279
sounds good and we'll go forward from

2168
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:43,319
there yeah the the Rubber City was the

2169
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:45,420
sour diesel reversed onto the um Scentsy

2170
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:46,679
star at the time but the four-way yeah

2171
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:49,140
now

2172
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:52,340
and that's what uh what I created the

2173
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:52,340
original River City with

2174
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,560
so that's then you hunted that a bunch

2175
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,640
so I grew out probably

2176
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,500
um

2177
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,780
right around 50 seeds I can't remember

2178
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,899
the exact number I grew out about 50

2179
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:09,840
seeds of it and these are all females

2180
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:12,299
all females yeah all females and they

2181
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:14,219
are they it was just absolutely

2182
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:16,739
beautiful I couldn't have I couldn't

2183
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:19,679
have asked for a better results

2184
01:23:16,738 --> 01:23:22,079
um I ended up cloning about half the Run

2185
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:25,079
uh for backups just because everything

2186
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:27,059
was looking so good uh halfway through I

2187
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:28,859
usually take my clones off the flowering

2188
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:30,840
plants you know a small Branch or

2189
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:32,339
something like that just so that they

2190
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,260
aren't constantly growing they're just

2191
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:36,900
re-veging in a stasis mode for a while

2192
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:39,060
until everything's finished yeah

2193
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:41,460
um when you keep a lot of moms you kind

2194
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:43,920
of have to right you have to figure out

2195
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:45,719
these little tactics to oh yeah have

2196
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,579
things outgrow each other and keep

2197
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:51,239
things in a stasis while being healthy

2198
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:53,640
at the same time yeah right so I um so I

2199
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:55,198
I definitely selected about half of them

2200
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,420
and then I did another run immediately

2201
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,279
after the sea drone was done just to

2202
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:01,800
double check because uh some people may

2203
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,599
not notice this but uh CD plants seed

2204
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,380
plants versus clone plants of the same

2205
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:09,539
exact copy of the genetic is can

2206
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:11,400
drastically differ oh yeah you know yeah

2207
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:14,939
um I mean maybe not drastically but they

2208
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:16,500
can differ yeah you know like uh seed

2209
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:18,839
plants usually tend to be more vigorous

2210
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:21,779
and yield more and you know do you guys

2211
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:24,480
agree with that oh yeah and Hermes right

2212
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:26,939
right yeah right they got yeah

2213
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,738
uh so I grew out a bunch of those I made

2214
01:24:26,939 --> 01:24:32,639
selections of half of them and then I

2215
01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:34,379
did about uh probably four maybe five

2216
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,840
rounds over the course of like a year

2217
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:38,880
and a half of narrowing it down I would

2218
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,039
just grow you know each grow I would

2219
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:44,760
narrow it down from like you know half

2220
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:46,260
of them to 20 to 15 to 10. and like once

2221
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,520
I got to like I remember getting to like

2222
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,640
eight of them that I had to choose

2223
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,320
between it was just like I they were all

2224
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,659
so good that they all would have been

2225
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,698
good you know I had to like nitpick like

2226
01:24:54,658 --> 01:24:58,619
this one this one structures a little

2227
01:24:56,698 --> 01:25:00,779
bit floppier than this one but they're

2228
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:03,300
all still still fire you know yeah it's

2229
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:05,759
super good so I just kind of splitting

2230
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:08,400
hairs there you go yep I was splitting

2231
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,719
hairs so uh but eventually I had uh I

2232
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:12,299
had narrowed it down after several

2233
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:13,800
different runs to uh the Rubber City

2234
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,960
number 10 and the Rubber City number

2235
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,880
four go figure I would find two of my

2236
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,060
best selections in the first 10 seats

2237
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:24,420
huh yeah right right out of the first I

2238
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:27,060
bought 15 and the number 20 was banging

2239
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:32,060
so everybody knows he resisted the urge

2240
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:35,159
to name it Rubber City 189. he did yeah

2241
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:38,460
his effort to make it seem like that you

2242
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:40,079
know so uh props on that one yeah I mean

2243
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:42,060
it is what it is I mean I'm not

2244
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,679
concerned with the numbers you know I

2245
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:45,780
post pictures people know what I do

2246
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,340
people know what I run like

2247
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:48,779
and we actually I remember when you were

2248
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:50,940
doing those selections and like the

2249
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:52,380
first round you're like oh my God guys I

2250
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:55,019
don't even know how I'm gonna cut

2251
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,659
through these let alone pick one or two

2252
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:59,219
you know yeah I remember I mean the

2253
01:25:57,658 --> 01:26:00,839
other part of it that was funny too was

2254
01:25:59,219 --> 01:26:04,020
he would pip would call me and be like

2255
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:06,539
so I smoke two or three examples and I'm

2256
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:08,460
now ruined and I don't think I can judge

2257
01:26:06,539 --> 01:26:11,340
anymore for a while because I'm already

2258
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:14,819
so baked I kind of have to chill out

2259
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:16,199
before I can try anymore yeah you know

2260
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:18,139
because that's what happens to it like

2261
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:20,099
testing a large number of things

2262
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:22,739
sometimes it's like you can only test

2263
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:24,840
two or three a day you know because you

2264
01:26:22,738 --> 01:26:28,799
wake up and you try a few and then all

2265
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:30,539
of a sudden your days changed yeah

2266
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,420
yeah it's hard to keep a fresh palette

2267
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:35,460
and a fresh head you know

2268
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:37,199
it's a slow process to do it the right

2269
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:39,899
way you got to do it over the course of

2270
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:42,299
days weeks you know months if you got

2271
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:43,738
enough stuff I guess right so I'll say

2272
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:45,179
one thing and then I'll shut up and let

2273
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:47,519
pip talk but one of the things I think

2274
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:50,579
that's cool that not very many people

2275
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,980
out here in breeding do anymore

2276
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:55,679
um but we have some friends that do is

2277
01:26:52,979 --> 01:26:58,138
that they make a hybrid like Rubber City

2278
01:26:55,679 --> 01:27:00,840
and then they hunt the hybrid and then

2279
01:26:58,139 --> 01:27:02,880
they select uh favorites from that and

2280
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,340
then they do further work

2281
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:08,219
right a lot of breeding today is sort of

2282
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:09,900
one step one-off one and done you make

2283
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:11,340
it you release it it's there till it's

2284
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:14,219
gone

2285
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:16,739
um and you know uh what we're about to

2286
01:27:14,219 --> 01:27:18,960
talk about right now is PIP you know he

2287
01:27:16,738 --> 01:27:22,019
made his some of his favorite selections

2288
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,340
and then he he you know he used those to

2289
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,739
make more things

2290
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:28,679
so let's start off with

2291
01:27:25,738 --> 01:27:31,799
um rubber band

2292
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:33,960
the rubber band yeah okay rubber band is

2293
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,699
the Rubber City number 10. so all this

2294
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,460
stuff on the on the Rubber City drop is

2295
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:40,500
my Rubber City 10 selection uh that I

2296
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:44,219
reversed uh so that would be the Rubber

2297
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:47,340
City 10 cross to uh triangle Kush okay

2298
01:27:44,219 --> 01:27:48,960
so I did that I named it rubber band as

2299
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:50,340
it's supposed to be said all is one word

2300
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,198
kind of like headband rubber band

2301
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:54,840
headband that's kind of my take on it

2302
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:56,939
you know um Sour Diesel OG Kush the

2303
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,920
Rubber City 10 is a is definitely more

2304
01:27:56,939 --> 01:28:00,178
of a sour diesel leaning looking type of

2305
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:02,579
plant

2306
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:04,260
um even though I consider it multiple

2307
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:06,779
times better than Sour Diesel I'll smoke

2308
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:08,760
it over Sour Diesel any day of the week

2309
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:10,319
yeah oh yeah

2310
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,719
yeah

2311
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,639
um so that's that's what the that's what

2312
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:17,880
the rubber band is

2313
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,859
um I did a uh I did a couple other ones

2314
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:21,960
um I did the the through chemd in there

2315
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:24,539
everybody loves the chemd and it's

2316
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:27,920
already got those those funky dirty like

2317
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:30,960
you know yeah really really gassy and

2318
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,219
skunky type of like smells to it so I

2319
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,899
figured that would be a good one to

2320
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:36,000
throw against it and and just produce

2321
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:37,979
some nice yielders and that's called

2322
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,658
Dirty Rubber and that's gonna be your

2323
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:42,909
that's going to be the dirty rubber yep

2324
01:28:39,658 --> 01:28:47,259
I like that name great name yep

2325
01:28:42,909 --> 01:28:47,260
[Laughter]

2326
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:53,579
yeah and um we have the the star dog you

2327
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:55,979
use the Corey aim cut for better than

2328
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:58,439
rubber I did yeah um like I said in the

2329
01:28:55,979 --> 01:29:00,359
description it the I've always liked the

2330
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:02,879
star dog that star dog cut it's a high

2331
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:04,859
yielder uh I pulled off some nice runs

2332
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,260
with it before it makes big flowers uh

2333
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:09,179
super gassy uh

2334
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:10,739
you know JJ did some good work with

2335
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:12,539
really good work with that line I enjoy

2336
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:14,939
that plant it's a great Cropper and it's

2337
01:29:12,539 --> 01:29:16,260
still got gas and uh and it shares a lot

2338
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:17,698
of similar traits with my Rubber City

2339
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:20,280
Tennis you know they're not the same

2340
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:22,619
plant by any means uh but they both are

2341
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:25,559
very vigorous growing big they're that

2342
01:29:22,619 --> 01:29:27,960
commercial style growth structure and

2343
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:31,020
stretch and Bud that you want you know

2344
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:32,760
like the colas and uh so I just I

2345
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:35,460
figured you know it'd be fun to cross

2346
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,840
them together and uh and and see what

2347
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:39,300
kind of craziness comes out of those

2348
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,159
things you know yeah and I see you have

2349
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:43,440
um some Rubber City back cross one and

2350
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:45,179
Rubber City back cross too let's talk

2351
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:48,119
about those yeah two different versions

2352
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:52,139
of the back crosses I uh I crossed the

2353
01:29:48,119 --> 01:29:54,539
uh sour back or the Rubber City 10 to

2354
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:56,760
the uh sour and I also crossed it to the

2355
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:58,139
four-way so you kind of have a choice

2356
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,520
you can kind of pick something that

2357
01:29:58,139 --> 01:30:00,779
you're gonna want to want to see a

2358
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,100
little bit more four-way or you're gonna

2359
01:30:00,779 --> 01:30:03,719
see you want something that you're gonna

2360
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:06,659
see a little bit more

2361
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:08,760
um uh sour you know yeah the Gold Coast

2362
01:30:06,658 --> 01:30:10,979
hash plant all right Gold Coast hash

2363
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:12,320
plant let's go yeah so the Gold Coast

2364
01:30:10,979 --> 01:30:16,559
hash plant

2365
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:18,779
uh is my Rubber City 10 selection across

2366
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,060
to death Coast sister so some of you

2367
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:23,639
people are familiar with my death Coast

2368
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:25,860
it makes a lot of really good extracts

2369
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:27,679
uh especially solventless it's popular

2370
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:30,539
artists popular

2371
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:33,840
it's really it's it's really the loudest

2372
01:30:30,539 --> 01:30:36,420
[ __ ] I've ever had and there's it

2373
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,520
produces Bunches of it so I run it over

2374
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:40,739
my t-shirt screens and save jars of it

2375
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:43,260
and send it to friends for a wow factor

2376
01:30:40,738 --> 01:30:45,299
yeah and uh so that their wives can

2377
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:48,119
scream at them and why the house house

2378
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:51,420
smells like a skunk yep yep

2379
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:53,760
that's for real that's just for Real uh

2380
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:57,119
so uh yeah but anyway the the death

2381
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:00,480
Coast was um out of the um the the BC

2382
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:02,779
one generation I did I crossed um

2383
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:06,599
uh Sour Diesel and death star

2384
01:31:02,779 --> 01:31:08,158
and made a selection and uh that was the

2385
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,480
popular one at the time but a lot of

2386
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,179
people don't know that I made a

2387
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:14,339
secondary selection as well uh which was

2388
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:16,319
definitely a more sour type of uh

2389
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:19,260
looking plant

2390
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:20,279
um and uh you know I enjoy it it was a

2391
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,900
little bit different than death coast

2392
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:24,779
and I've been smoking it for a long time

2393
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:26,519
and uh eventually I started I was making

2394
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:28,319
death Coast hash and I said oh I'll make

2395
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:30,719
hash with the death Coast sister too

2396
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:32,460
this time and see how it does because

2397
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,779
every time I break it up you know

2398
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:36,658
something's hashy when you break it up

2399
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:38,340
for a joint and you see you can just see

2400
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:40,500
it all fall onto the table you've moved

2401
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:42,900
you move the pile of weed a little bit

2402
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,420
and there's there's a line of hash left

2403
01:31:42,899 --> 01:31:47,939
you know yeah

2404
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:50,399
just dumps so uh and I've always liked

2405
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:52,619
the plant so anyway it just you know I

2406
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:55,259
broke that thing up and it was it was

2407
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:58,079
dumping big time Big Big Time and I was

2408
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:59,579
just I just the smoke was phenomenal I

2409
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:01,800
was like I gotta do something with this

2410
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:05,100
thing this is this is too good

2411
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:06,779
so I cross it to my River City 10 and uh

2412
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,159
when it was seated up

2413
01:32:06,779 --> 01:32:10,500
um breaking it up when it was even

2414
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:12,658
because seeded plants are you know

2415
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:14,819
notoriously thought to not produce as

2416
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:15,719
much resin right

2417
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:18,658
um

2418
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:20,399
you there yeah yeah okay yeah seated

2419
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:22,738
plants are thought to not really produce

2420
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:25,738
as much resin right well this thing

2421
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:28,138
dumped just as good if not better

2422
01:32:25,738 --> 01:32:30,059
seated yeah because it does unseated and

2423
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:32,039
it just I've got the pictures of my Ig

2424
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:34,100
you can see the gloves it's just after

2425
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:36,119
every couple ounces two three ounces

2426
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,860
breaking it up with your hands the

2427
01:32:36,119 --> 01:32:39,479
gloves are just so caked that they're

2428
01:32:37,859 --> 01:32:41,460
falling apart and ripping like you have

2429
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:43,500
to switch your gloves and

2430
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,539
it's pretty wild it's pretty wild

2431
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:47,219
stuffed I mean is that what is the death

2432
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:51,719
Coast sister is that what we would call

2433
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:53,760
like internally the SD uh bx7 yes yes

2434
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:55,739
that's Yeah in our group that's the

2435
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:59,039
first the first name on the label the

2436
01:32:55,738 --> 01:33:01,439
sour diesel DX number seven plant yeah

2437
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:03,539
yeah not not bx7 but yeah it's number

2438
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:06,059
seven yeah yeah yes yes

2439
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:09,658
yep uh so I've had that one for a while

2440
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:10,199
you know probably my pride enjoys

2441
01:33:09,658 --> 01:33:13,019
um

2442
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:14,579
I only I I the flower is nice a lot of

2443
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:16,679
people request the flower I personally

2444
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:19,260
prefer to smoke the hash over the flour

2445
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:22,920
same with the death Coast

2446
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:24,780
um they're like it's just it just the

2447
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,359
flower is good but I love I love my hash

2448
01:33:24,779 --> 01:33:28,920
and when I got a plant that dumps like

2449
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:30,238
this you know that's when I yeah that's

2450
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:33,420
what I'm using it for and that's kind of

2451
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:36,119
what I created it for is for uh to to be

2452
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:38,520
like a hash plant you know I'm shocked

2453
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:39,899
that this I I don't know why I mean

2454
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,460
because you're you're this is one of the

2455
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:43,738
cuts you were real open with about

2456
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:46,800
sharing yeah I don't know why that this

2457
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:48,299
didn't hit the like boom past the hype

2458
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,320
market and just shoot to the top because

2459
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:54,779
it jumps like uh for resin production

2460
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:57,299
extracts how loud it is like some people

2461
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:59,698
will smell this as a straight up skunk I

2462
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:02,699
think so people like I smell more burnt

2463
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:03,779
rubber with that back end but to a lot

2464
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:05,099
of people this is going to be one of the

2465
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:08,039
skunkiest things they've ever smelled

2466
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:09,840
and actually I think the skunk comes out

2467
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:12,119
stronger in the hash

2468
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,500
definitely yeah that's for sure you know

2469
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:16,619
and I think that happens with the

2470
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:19,979
numbers Amplified yeah uh the skunkiness

2471
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:22,500
is Amplified in hashish yeah it really

2472
01:34:19,979 --> 01:34:26,279
it really is it's uh

2473
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:29,219
I love my hash man yeah I'm making cash

2474
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:31,198
too uh what else we got let's see uh

2475
01:34:29,219 --> 01:34:34,380
talk about the

2476
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:37,079
um premium rubber yes premium rubber is

2477
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:38,940
one of my pride and joy Creations uh

2478
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:40,380
that is both of my Rubber City

2479
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:42,960
selections

2480
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:43,980
crossed together

2481
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,319
um

2482
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:48,539
you still there yeah okay so that's

2483
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:50,880
where so the four and the ten yeah the

2484
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:52,500
four and the ten uh cross together and

2485
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,960
those are my two favorite plants that's

2486
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,819
all I smoke really uh I I you know I

2487
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,739
smoke silver Pearl I smoke I throw mix

2488
01:34:56,819 --> 01:35:00,479
other stuff in but my daily smoke for

2489
01:34:58,738 --> 01:35:03,479
the past

2490
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:05,218
four years has been pretty much the

2491
01:35:03,479 --> 01:35:08,579
Rubber City 10 or the River City four

2492
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:10,439
the Rubber City number 10 is more of a

2493
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:12,960
high you like higher yielder than the

2494
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:14,339
four like as far as like bigger buds I

2495
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,500
shouldn't say I mean slightly higher

2496
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:18,539
higher yielder but it's bigger buds it's

2497
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:20,520
more along the sour side of the spectrum

2498
01:35:18,539 --> 01:35:21,960
but it's still got all the gas and skunk

2499
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:24,900
and onion and rubber it's got all that

2500
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:26,219
stuff in it but um and it's like the

2501
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:28,019
high yield or so it's kind of like the

2502
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:29,819
All-Star so I look at that as like my

2503
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:31,139
commercial the commercial All-Star and

2504
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:33,238
then I have the number four which is

2505
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:35,279
like my head stash All-Star even though

2506
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:37,079
I smoke I'm both the same but the the

2507
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:41,698
head stash one is a little bit less sour

2508
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:43,979
diesel more like uh uh it's got the sour

2509
01:35:41,698 --> 01:35:45,658
diesel it's got all the gassiness all

2510
01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:48,178
the skunkiness all the everything but

2511
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:51,599
it's got a lot of uh Aromas and potency

2512
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:55,619
from um the four-way cut

2513
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:58,440
so it's got It's very very hashy like it

2514
01:35:55,619 --> 01:36:00,179
burns um it when you take a hit off a

2515
01:35:58,439 --> 01:36:02,039
bull and you set the bowl down that bowl

2516
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:03,420
just keeps burning a little trail of

2517
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:05,698
smoke off of it like when you're smoking

2518
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:08,279
hash out of a bowl right yeah uh but

2519
01:36:05,698 --> 01:36:10,738
with just the weed it like that's you

2520
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:13,380
know and it tastes like hash and it is

2521
01:36:10,738 --> 01:36:14,638
just one of the most potent plants I put

2522
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:17,400
it right there next to the Death Star

2523
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:20,880
you know it's it's it's just uh you know

2524
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:22,920
it might surpass it I I I really it's so

2525
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,960
I don't know man it's my favorite plant

2526
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:26,520
that that I've ever made and I've ever

2527
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:30,239
selected and I'll probably have it with

2528
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,880
me till I go to my grave yeah yeah I'm

2529
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:34,738
still partial to the Pearl but this

2530
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:37,139
stuff for people looking for like those

2531
01:36:34,738 --> 01:36:38,879
volatile sulfur compounds right this is

2532
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:40,920
such a special plant

2533
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,480
such a special plant but don't forget

2534
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,739
about his pearles ones that he's got

2535
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:46,259
because those are pretty pretty

2536
01:36:43,738 --> 01:36:48,779
phenomenal too so I have no doubt uh

2537
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:51,239
people are gonna find some extremely

2538
01:36:48,779 --> 01:36:53,359
nice plants and uh not all of this of

2539
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:57,119
course but especially the premium rubber

2540
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:59,819
uh with that four being crossed in there

2541
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:02,099
um you know the sky's the limit I mean

2542
01:36:59,819 --> 01:37:04,559
there could be some some serious

2543
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:08,219
unicorns pulled out of that thing yeah I

2544
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:10,080
think uh and um so that's kind of one

2545
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:11,760
that I that I really I really take a lot

2546
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:13,260
of pride in I like that one and then I

2547
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,420
have the the last one would be the

2548
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:18,060
Goodyear which is the Rubber City number

2549
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:21,658
10 s ones as well

2550
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:23,699
uh cross to cross to itself and um and

2551
01:37:21,658 --> 01:37:26,039
those will be those will be extremely

2552
01:37:23,698 --> 01:37:28,559
high yielding they will be more along

2553
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:31,079
the lines of sour but a lot of them are

2554
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:33,060
more uh the Rubber City 10 is more it's

2555
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:34,920
more dense than this hour but it's not

2556
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:38,699
like dense like Indica dense it's just

2557
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:40,739
yeah not as Loose as like sour is and um

2558
01:37:38,698 --> 01:37:43,919
and it's easier to grow sour is a

2559
01:37:40,738 --> 01:37:45,419
finicky plant uh definitely I mean you

2560
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:48,179
can grow it and get it to come out okay

2561
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:50,399
but to get it to come out 110 like you

2562
01:37:48,179 --> 01:37:52,980
really gotta you know it's really easy

2563
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:55,920
it's really easy to make poofy sour too

2564
01:37:52,979 --> 01:37:57,839
oh yeah oh yeah I've seen a lot of bad

2565
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:00,359
sour that that was actually sour but

2566
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,039
just bad it's easy to screw it up I'm

2567
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:03,960
guilty I've done it before you know

2568
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:06,238
definitely have myself

2569
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,380
um but it's just sour is just such a

2570
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:09,658
tough plant and that's kind of one of

2571
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:12,600
the reasons I wanted to do this uh is

2572
01:38:09,658 --> 01:38:15,899
just because it's it these plants are I

2573
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:17,639
feel like better than sour and and they

2574
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:19,679
are easier to grow than sour they're not

2575
01:38:17,639 --> 01:38:22,139
as finicky and sensitive and all that

2576
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:23,819
kinds of stuff and yeah I feel like you

2577
01:38:22,139 --> 01:38:25,319
know people say clones lose Vigor over

2578
01:38:23,819 --> 01:38:28,500
the years and stuff like that I didn't

2579
01:38:25,319 --> 01:38:31,979
have sour diesel in the 90s so I don't

2580
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:33,719
know what it was like back then but uh

2581
01:38:31,979 --> 01:38:35,698
today it's still a nice plant and

2582
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:38,219
vigorous and it makes a good yield but

2583
01:38:35,698 --> 01:38:41,099
it's got nothing on the on the River

2584
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:42,539
City 10. like it's just this the rubbers

2585
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,219
like we were talking about how eludium

2586
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:46,260
is like the new Bubba like the the

2587
01:38:44,219 --> 01:38:49,139
Rubber City number 10 is basically like

2588
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:51,719
how I look at it it's the new upgraded

2589
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:53,159
version of Sour Diesel I know the guys

2590
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:55,679
in our group are running it like that

2591
01:38:53,158 --> 01:38:58,138
too oh yeah they're using it and working

2592
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:00,899
into lines is their new sour of bitter

2593
01:38:58,139 --> 01:39:02,460
and cry baby in those guys yeah one

2594
01:39:00,899 --> 01:39:04,500
thing maybe that I thought we should we

2595
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:08,039
could mention real quick uh before we

2596
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:10,738
run out of time here is that the when

2597
01:39:08,039 --> 01:39:12,600
Pip was just talking about uh you know

2598
01:39:10,738 --> 01:39:14,579
some of these hybrids he actually did

2599
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,620
something that I think is really cool

2600
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:20,039
and it's kind of it's actually super

2601
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:22,619
rare which is most times when people

2602
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:24,539
make feminized hybrids they're either

2603
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:28,679
outcrossing it to a totally different

2604
01:39:24,539 --> 01:39:31,920
line or they are s wanting it and one of

2605
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:34,380
the rarest things is to make feminist

2606
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:37,319
seed from two different examples from

2607
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:40,980
the same line yeah right so making

2608
01:39:37,319 --> 01:39:42,479
something like the rc10 by the rc4 is

2609
01:39:40,979 --> 01:39:44,698
actually something that's super rare

2610
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:45,959
it's actually a feminized Rubber City

2611
01:39:44,698 --> 01:39:48,658
Line

2612
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:50,340
right yeah it's for it's further work

2613
01:39:48,658 --> 01:39:52,559
and it's one of the rarest things that

2614
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:55,139
you'll see on the market because almost

2615
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:58,260
all feminized reversals like I said are

2616
01:39:55,139 --> 01:39:59,219
either s1s or outcrosses to something

2617
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:01,860
different

2618
01:39:59,219 --> 01:40:05,460
it not Line work there's very little

2619
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:08,158
feminized Line work in a way so I don't

2620
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:11,639
know exactly know what you'd call rc10

2621
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:13,799
by rc4 like how you did that f1r

2622
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:19,020
you know that's how we call it

2623
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:21,060
what f1r F1 reversal just F2

2624
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:22,920
yeah I mean it can't it's the second

2625
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:25,260
generation of Representative yeah I mean

2626
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:28,500
it's a it's a reversal it's in the same

2627
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:29,699
line so it's it's in Crossing it in a

2628
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:31,920
sense too

2629
01:40:29,698 --> 01:40:34,919
it's just it's a pure Rubber City Line

2630
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:38,158
F1 it's not it's not an F1 right it

2631
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:40,319
would be an F2 yeah because it is

2632
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:41,939
totally different clone yeah f2r yeah

2633
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:45,238
you're right but I just wanted to point

2634
01:40:41,939 --> 01:40:47,219
out that in in in feminized seed it's

2635
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:49,198
that that line is one of the rarest

2636
01:40:47,219 --> 01:40:52,260
things which it's Line work but made

2637
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:56,039
femini style it's not an outcross and

2638
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:58,380
it's not uh an S1 it's not inbred it's

2639
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:59,639
you know it's uh two full sisters

2640
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,619
crossed to each other which doesn't

2641
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:03,539
happen that often yeah I've seen it

2642
01:41:01,619 --> 01:41:04,859
happen quite a bit lately I think people

2643
01:41:03,539 --> 01:41:06,420
are finally starting to catch on to

2644
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:08,880
stuff like that

2645
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:10,199
um and if if my theory is correct about

2646
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:12,359
uh

2647
01:41:10,198 --> 01:41:16,519
the super skunk trait the Afghan tea

2648
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:20,759
trait being a a was it double recessive

2649
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:23,159
then every time you cross to the Afghan

2650
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,920
T types together you're reinforcing that

2651
01:41:23,158 --> 01:41:27,420
trait and you're getting those volatile

2652
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:29,100
sulfur compounds like just stacking and

2653
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:31,380
stacking that's what I think's going on

2654
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:33,600
and like this is that ultimate example

2655
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:35,579
of that I mean if you want some of its

2656
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,739
parents or some of it's some of it's

2657
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:39,479
rarer stuff that could be in the line to

2658
01:41:37,738 --> 01:41:42,959
pop up that would probably be the line

2659
01:41:39,479 --> 01:41:45,539
to look through yeah oh yeah then like I

2660
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,279
said man there is going to be I mean I

2661
01:41:45,539 --> 01:41:49,679
haven't done a ton of that line yet I've

2662
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:51,179
just done small populations but the uh

2663
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:54,060
you know eventually I would like to

2664
01:41:51,179 --> 01:41:56,639
throw down a couple hundred seeds of of

2665
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:59,520
Premium Rubber and the Goodyear and uh

2666
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:00,900
even some of the the BC work you know

2667
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,460
yeah

2668
01:42:00,899 --> 01:42:04,920
um and just really go through them like

2669
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:06,840
the right way unfortunately like I in my

2670
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:08,460
position you know up until this point

2671
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,739
I've only been able to test like 50

2672
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:12,719
plants around 50 plants of each line

2673
01:42:10,738 --> 01:42:14,339
that I make yeah and you know that's

2674
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,219
done me pretty good that's given me some

2675
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:19,560
really nice selections oh yeah

2676
01:42:16,219 --> 01:42:20,760
surprisingly uh you know I really didn't

2677
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:21,960
think it was at first when I first

2678
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,520
started all this I didn't think it was

2679
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:26,039
going to be that easy I figured I'd have

2680
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,980
to look through a thousand seeds to to

2681
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:31,260
find that one you know and sometimes you

2682
01:42:28,979 --> 01:42:34,519
do I feel like you know you probably do

2683
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:37,139
but if you're popping Haze maybe right

2684
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:38,760
so I had to troll time I mean sometimes

2685
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:40,800
you get lucky and you find it in five

2686
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:43,320
sometimes you find it in fifty sometimes

2687
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,179
it takes multiple rounds because you can

2688
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:47,939
find exactly what you were hunting for

2689
01:42:45,179 --> 01:42:49,800
so it just is you know it's it's a love

2690
01:42:47,939 --> 01:42:52,559
it's a roll the dice and a law of

2691
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:54,719
averages yeah 50 has been good for me

2692
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:57,539
like I said I found some amazing seeds

2693
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:59,279
and our amazing plants and and 50 seed

2694
01:42:57,539 --> 01:43:01,560
populations

2695
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:03,420
um you know uh you know you do 50 seeds

2696
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,880
of Premium rubber or the Goodyear or

2697
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,960
something like that and I mean we're

2698
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,520
talking you're going to be seeing

2699
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,319
everything those lines have to offer

2700
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,820
that's I mean you're going to find

2701
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:13,500
you're going to find some really really

2702
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:15,658
really nice stuff you don't need to pop

2703
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:17,520
100 seeds you don't even really need to

2704
01:43:15,658 --> 01:43:19,559
pop 50 you know like you just you know

2705
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,480
get a few packs and that's another thing

2706
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:24,719
I'd suggest if anybody's interested in

2707
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:27,118
like figure out what line you want and

2708
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,579
um and buy multiple packs

2709
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,679
yeah

2710
01:43:28,579 --> 01:43:33,118
that's a mistake I made early on in my

2711
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:35,460
in breeding

2712
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:37,799
is uh I would go to Amsterdam and I

2713
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:40,380
would buy like 20 different things

2714
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:42,119
instead of buying a bunch of packs of a

2715
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,500
few different things yeah and having

2716
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:45,059
more to look through because I got

2717
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:47,520
excited

2718
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:50,820
um so sometimes having more seeds of one

2719
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:53,639
line is better than having you know one

2720
01:43:50,819 --> 01:43:55,319
pack of eight different things also from

2721
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:57,480
a Breeder's perspective when I get

2722
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:59,219
orders in and since I'm the one filling

2723
01:43:57,479 --> 01:44:01,919
orders and I think you know Pip's going

2724
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:04,500
to be too when we see someone old order

2725
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,899
multiple packs of one line

2726
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:08,698
like 99 of the time I'm going to hook

2727
01:44:06,899 --> 01:44:10,259
them up with like multiple packs of

2728
01:44:08,698 --> 01:44:11,759
other lines too because I know they're

2729
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:13,619
doing serious stuff I know they're being

2730
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,060
serious about what they're doing so I'm

2731
01:44:13,618 --> 01:44:16,979
more likely to do stuff like that even

2732
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:19,020
but every step and you know surprisingly

2733
01:44:16,979 --> 01:44:21,238
it's it's kind of rare not very many

2734
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:22,500
people do that would you agree yeah no

2735
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:24,959
it is

2736
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,520
huh yeah it's definitely that rare and

2737
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,960
that's why when I see it I'm like yes

2738
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,219
I'm gonna hook this dude up they're

2739
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,779
serious yeah people know what they're

2740
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:32,279
doing people are on a mission they know

2741
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:34,019
the strain they want they know they want

2742
01:44:32,279 --> 01:44:36,300
to find the one so they drop the money

2743
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:38,040
on it they make the investment and you

2744
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:39,539
know it doesn't matter what it costs as

2745
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:41,698
long as you get the plant that plant you

2746
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:43,618
can make the sky's the limit whatever

2747
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:44,638
however much money you want because you

2748
01:44:43,618 --> 01:44:46,139
have that plant for the rest of your

2749
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:47,639
life you know it doesn't matter if that

2750
01:44:46,139 --> 01:44:50,639
seed costs twenty dollars or thirty

2751
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:52,440
dollars whatever you know hell that the

2752
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:54,600
plan will pay itself back when you grow

2753
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:57,000
it from seed

2754
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:58,679
and then you have it forever so

2755
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,679
it's always nice to find that special

2756
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:03,420
one so anyway if you if you're gonna if

2757
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,399
you're looking at the menu you know just

2758
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:08,158
uh just pick a line or two or whatever

2759
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:09,839
that you're interested in and uh and get

2760
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:10,738
a few packs of it you know two-pack I

2761
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,199
mean you're gonna you're gonna be happy

2762
01:45:10,738 --> 01:45:14,579
with all the plants obviously but it's a

2763
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:17,759
lottery it's a numbers game when you

2764
01:45:14,579 --> 01:45:19,500
grow seeds as everybody knows um like I

2765
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,880
said I got lucky with my number 10 and

2766
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,219
number four they were in the first 10

2767
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:25,139
seeds of uh of a larger progeny you know

2768
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:28,439
yeah it's just the roll of the dice

2769
01:45:25,139 --> 01:45:29,940
sometimes uh but um but you're going to

2770
01:45:28,439 --> 01:45:31,379
be happy I mean you're going to be happy

2771
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:32,759
with anything you get that's crossed to

2772
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:34,199

be really nice plants of course there's

2774
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:37,618
always some better than others

2775
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:40,500
um but like I said it's just a numbers

2776
01:45:37,618 --> 01:45:42,179
game grab you know two three packs uh

2777
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,920
that should that should be enough for

2778
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:46,618
most people if you're like extremely

2779
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,118
serious you know um and you really just

2780
01:45:46,618 --> 01:45:50,099

01:49:07,439 --> 01:49:12,599
was to give people a chance to listen to

2868

01:49:32,579 --> 01:49:36,479
they're interested in

2878
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,159
um and I think that like the way he

2879
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:41,459
breeds is pretty neat because he doesn't

2880
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:43,138
really do any hype stuff too much he

2881
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:44,880
kind of like if you listen to this

2882
01:49:43,139 --> 01:49:47,340
podcast he kind of like collected

2883
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,319
strains over the years and he picked

2884
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:51,659
favorites and then he decided what

2885
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:54,420
happens if I mix these favorites

2886
01:49:51,658 --> 01:49:56,158
and that is sort of like the basis for

2887
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:59,520
what he's been doing so it's a very

2888
01:49:56,158 --> 01:50:01,799
personal approach in my opinion

2889
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,540
um he bred things he liked which is

2890
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:06,060
something I always tell people to do

2891
01:50:03,539 --> 01:50:07,319
pick things you like and try to find

2892
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:09,300
things you like

2893
01:50:07,319 --> 01:50:10,679
you know and don't care about what the

2894
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,360
rest of the world thinks find things

2895
01:50:10,679 --> 01:50:15,359
that you think are interesting

2896
01:50:12,359 --> 01:50:17,579
and I think that this list uh definitely

2897
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:20,039
represents that in a big way

2898
01:50:17,579 --> 01:50:21,658
yeah that's a big positive and it

2899
01:50:20,039 --> 01:50:23,460
doesn't matter if your family gets upset

2900
01:50:21,658 --> 01:50:25,559
that you hang out at rest stops and with

2901
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:26,789
that this will be the end of the show

2902
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:29,909
thanks

man

2905
01:50:33,719 --> 01:50:38,658
it was like it was like I was connected

2906
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:40,919
with everything around me

2907
01:50:38,658 --> 01:50:43,319
all of a sudden I just started

2908
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:45,560
questioning everything I'd ever been

2909
01:50:43,319 --> 01:50:45,559
told

2910
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:53,360
you know by the time by the time I got

2911
01:50:49,618 --> 01:50:53,359
high that very first time

2912
01:50:53,819 --> 01:50:57,139
started to hit me

2913
01:50:57,420 --> 01:50:59,980
and I'm like wow
