breeder Syndicate I'm here with Jay from

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,740
Next Generation seeds formerly of

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,420
federation seed bank thank you for

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,639
coming on the show brother

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,439
oh thanks for having me

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,719
um you're you're someone we've wanted to

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,079
talk to for a long time we don't we have

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,278
not covered BC in super depth and you're

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,159
one of the people that was super

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,640
integral in that scene uh responsible

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,319
for most of at least maybe you're

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,659
responsible for bringing it to seed most

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,780
of what is still being used today from

19
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:47,218
the BC area I should say and I'd love to

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,379
talk with you about some of that maybe

21
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,000
start with the early Federation time and

22
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,979
maybe a little bit before that and talk

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,019
about what got you into weed what what

24
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,339
Canada was like when you got into weed

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,899
all that

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,300
um yeah

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,939
yeah well well Canada as you know is a

28
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,140
big country like the us and we have

29
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,539
vastly different cultures depending on

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,280
where you live in Canada and I I grew up

31
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,979
on the Canadian prairies in a very

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,560
conservative community and

33
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:14,879
um our weed was hard to get it was very

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,320
expensive

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,839
and you have to deal with Shady people

36
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,239
so our Dream as a Young Stoner growing

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
up in Manitoba is to go to the West

38
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,719
Coast uh where all the good stuff came

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,118
from so when I moved uh out to Vancouver

40
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,039
um I just immersed myself into it

41
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:32,879
immediately

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,240
um

43
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,459
just try try to learn how to grow and I

44
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,399
was fortunate enough to get a job at

45
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:44,699
Mark Emery's uh hemp BC it was called oh

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,100
wow yeah and um I was just hired as the

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,859
kid in the back as the carpenter

48
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,059
building things wiring up the girl kits

49
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,478
building

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,399
um hydroponic systems yeah and um and

51
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,319
that was my kind of my first year just

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,359
getting to know uh Growers all

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,379
throughout British Columbia and the West

54
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,239
Coast

55
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,899
um

56
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,780
that was

57
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,479
oh that would have been 95 I believe

58
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,459
awesome yeah

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,340
and I spent about a half six months to a

60
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,520
year doing that and of course as soon as

61
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,280
I could I started my own grow up and uh

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,560
together with Mike from uh Federation

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,719
uh me and did that together and I would

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,939
just collected as many clones as we

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,800
could get our hands on yeah I noticed a

66
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,378
lot of the people in DC were so spoiled

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,060
that they could they could they would

68
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:34,439
drop take a really good clone and then

69
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,360
not keep mothers of it because they

70
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,159
could just buy another drink for the

71
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,680
next crop because everybody had

72
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,019
phrase and me is somebody where it's

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,180
extremely rare uh I just gathered

74
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,219
everything I get my hands on and within

75
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,500
a year I probably had over 60 different

76
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,080
mother strains going right and then

77
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,759
testing them and dropping the ones that

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
were shipped and keeping the good ones

79
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,719
as you do

80
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,180
um and then yeah then Mike and I started

81
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,479
Federation not only lasted with me about

82
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,700
maybe a year and a half yeah and we went

83
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,318
our separate ways after that

84
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,119
um

85
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,859
but and then next

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
next generation was started shortly

87
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,180
thereafter

88
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,399
that's all right from Federation

89
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,459
um I started Next Generation right away

90
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,519
yeah and uh moved to Vancouver Island

91
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,900
away from the city got myself a place in

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,719
the country and nice Farm to work on and

93
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,760
yeah I got into a really hardcore ever

94
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,158
since uh

95
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,439
I was just I was uh kind of uh just a

96
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,239
collector of strains I was obsessed of

97
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,878
uh

98
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,299
some awesome collecting

99
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,298
and

100
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,598
cardio there

101
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,280
I can't hear Matt oh yeah there we go

102
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,780
sorry about it there we go yeah there's

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,640
got it muted

104
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,140
um

105
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,598
a lot of us when we get into breeding

106
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,639
like especially with me I know I dove in

107
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,158
head first I wanted I wanted to see

108
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,679
everything you know like collected moms

109
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:10,318
kept like hundreds of moms of everything

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,459
and it took a long time to start sorting

111
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,318
through this stuff but you have that

112
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,539
excitement and vigor at the beginning of

113
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,180
just I want everything I need to see it

114
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,858
all so yeah what were some of the ones

115
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,780
like the very first clones you started

116
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,120
getting

117
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:27,179
um well we had a few um like the sweet

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,040
paint grapefruit uh that Romulan they

119
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,959
were from Romulan Joe I was robbing the

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,000
Joe for a while

121
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,918
um and some Hawaiian sativas that came

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,040
through uh Mr G Mountain there from

123
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:42,120
violent Seed Company uh he had a lot of

124
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,040
good crosses uh that are phenomenal in

125
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,860
in my opinion he's one of the most

126
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,379
underrated breeders uh from back in the

127
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,900
day uh can we talk about him for a quick

128
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,819
sec just to give him a little bit of

129
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,758
shine because that's someone like even I

130
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:59,040
this far in I didn't know how integral

131
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,740
Mr G was into

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,240
all of it the the whole Vancouver not

133
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,280
just Vancouver Island specifically but

134
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,680
the BC scene how much of his genetics

135
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,239
played a role in creating the larger uh

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,639
Supply

137
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,439
yeah and uh a lot of people see well

138
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,259
these are an old-timer he's very very

139
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,000
quiet very private sure he's

140
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,860
connected with all kinds of people and

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,680
he's he just kept his head down and uh

142
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,100
and did good work and a lot of his

143
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,959
clones and cuts got passed around and he

144
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,720
would make uh sometimes make a lot of

145
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,758
crosses that he never himself never had

146
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,500
a time to grow should we give it to

147
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,580
other Growers here test these out test

148
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,399
these out

149
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:40,139
um and we received some good seeds the

150
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,859
original Hawaiian sativa came from him

151
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,600
wow um uh Burmese he had a beautiful

152
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,240
Burmese and I know a few other Growers

153
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,979
have copied his Burmese is he a source

154
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,978
he was the Burmese that went around BC

155
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,879
yeah I can't say 100 sure but he was the

156
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,240
first one

157
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,459
um that I know that had it okay and he

158
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,379
he had it before uh I believe before

159
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,799
reefer man um

160
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:13,019
had it um yeah I know and if he he was

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,300
the source of the grandparents of the

162
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:18,719
original God bud and a lot of those

163
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,280
varieties uh and that's what I've read I

164
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,440
have my Grape God crossed but I didn't

165
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,379
read it with the Grape God clone I read

166
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,360
it with the parents of the Grape God so

167
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,399
that's really so confusing with that um

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,379
my mind's slightly different than the uh

169
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,120
from the the God Bud

170
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:34,019
um yeah a little more a little more

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,939
fruity

172
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,579
um a little more stink to it

173
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,740
what were the um grandparents of the the

174
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:43,258
god butt um

175
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,759
well there's lots of rumors and there's

176
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,919
a lot of confusion

177
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,360
um but it was a strain that he called

178
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,120
Jiffy puck

179
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,620
okay which uh I always told them it was

180
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,220
not a very good name you could come up

181
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,220
with better names

182
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:01,739
even though they're of course

183
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,978
yeah but then for everything

184
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,538
yeah a few other Growers um had the

185
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,060
Clone and they did a few crosses and

186
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:10,259
then it got renamed different sex groups

187
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,680
and Growers named it different things

188
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,840
yeah after that some Growers called the

189
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,639
A-frame some were just calling it purple

190
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:21,418
skunk

191
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,460
um and then uh the the grandchildren of

192
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:26,579
it the granddaughter I guess is what

193
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,079
became known as the god mud oh okay and

194
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,758
that was via

195
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,978
the only one I've ever heard of those

196
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,379
was the people from Canada have talked

197
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:36,959
to me about the purple skunk

198
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,939
you know yeah I think that there's

199
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,879
different Generations or groups of goers

200
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,740
I think there's two different section uh

201
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,019
different uh groups of genetics that

202
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,860
were both called purple skunk it makes

203
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:53,219
sense because it's a very common name

204
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,840
yes purple and skunk yeah yeah kind of

205
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,639
like purple kush up there yeah was it

206
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,638
was there an early just single Purple

207
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,680
Kush clone that was brought up there or

208
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,660
um

209
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,000
not that was brought up here I believe

210
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,220
um reefer men I would probably know a

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,139
lot more about that than me uh he had

212
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,560
one of the first purple gunks in the

213
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,939
island pink I believe it was and I think

214
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,538
I was bred out of something that he

215
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,860
calls uh King The King mud or King I had

216
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:21,959
that written down here to ask you about

217
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,538
yeah the king yeah but I'm just not

218
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,758
really uh too sure we were in we were in

219
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,079
different Circles of uh communities but

220
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,120
we didn't run into each other quite

221
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,718
often and we actually chat now more than

222
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:39,299
we did back then so yeah

223
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:41,879
so we we have you going on in and uh to

224
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,819
to Federation you have a little bit of

225
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,439
interaction with another person and how

226
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,420
early on did you start interacting with

227
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,360
like Romulan Joe and Romulan the Clones

228
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,639
first Romulan actually that was very uh

229
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,620
that was even before we that was the

230
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,080
start of federation Seed Company we

231
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,000
hadn't had a seed company and uh Romulan

232
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,759
Joe I was just like I say I was a young

233
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,339
kid building Hydro equipment and uh

234
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,838
Romeo and Joe uh I would just buy my

235
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,839
personal smoke off of them every week

236
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,060
when it came to town and uh you said one

237
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,980
weekend he needed help harvesting and

238
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:15,778
moving his his crop from Vancouver

239
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,600
Island over to the city

240
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:20,220
so I went and helped him for the weekend

241
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,680
and me and my buddy Mike were talking

242
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,420
about starting a seed company and the

243
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,659
Romulan was one of the Rave

244
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:30,958
um yeah at the time and so Romulan Joe

245
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:34,439
uh sold us the Clone for seven thousand

246
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,018
dollars uh we got we got a couple cuts

247
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,519
he just gave us a few cuts and he was

248
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,019
seven thousand bucks and that was our

249
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,720
Flagship strain

250
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,039
um that we started with it kind of built

251
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,740
our company around

252
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,199
yeah yeah and it it made a big

253
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,240
difference in the in the in the world of

254
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
seeds I I know that was one of the ones

255
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,860
I chased really early on and I don't

256
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,278
know that we ever saw the real Romulan

257
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,959
pure clone in the U.S I doubt it yeah I

258
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,480
I doubt it too I haven't seen the real

259
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,759
thing down there I mean there was so

260
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,560
many rumors about that clone and where

261
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,539
it came from

262
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,639
um and it was very hard back in like the

263
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:14,099
Forum days and stuff and even earlier to

264
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,740
determine what was true you know there

265
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,920
was rumors that like the guy Romulan Joe

266
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,320
was actually called Mendocino Joe and

267
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,319
came from Neo yeah and came from rings

268
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,060
and eyes County and fled to Canada when

269
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,680
a bunch of busts went down and then

270
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,219
there was Canadians that said that was

271
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:35,338
Bull that was definitely not true and

272
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,860
not true you know from the 70s nope it's

273
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,140
from the 90s it's from the 40s remember

274
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,459
that was from there was just it was just

275
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,679
one of those ones that there was a lot

276
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:46,078
of rumor and there was very little fact

277
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,719
come coming out or someone who like knew

278
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,578
for sure would come out and just say

279
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,680
what needed to be said so it allowed all

280
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:55,679
these stories to percolate

281
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,679
legendary

282
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,820
and Romney and Joe was very secretive

283
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,459
and he just kind of got a kick out of

284
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,800
all the stories that go around uh about

285
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,359
sure he just kind of talked with now and

286
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,578
I've actually seen him a few months ago

287
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,100
and uh I stopped by his place for a

288
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:13,379
smoke and uh I told him about some of

289
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,320
the rumors because I had somebody from

290
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:19,259
the states that breeds Romulan telling

291
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,820
the story and and I told Joe about this

292
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:24,120
and he just shook his head and laughed

293
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,459
and he goes no no no no no no it's not

294
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,379
how it works yeah I think that person's

295
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,719
claiming they bred it or like that it's

296
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,578
from their family

297
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,720
yeah yeah

298
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:35,338
Mendocino Joe's They're family members

299
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,899
one of the crazy one of the things in

300
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,019
cannabis is since we all come out of the

301
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:42,419
Shadows it's very hard to have facts so

302
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,459
people come out with a big story and

303
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,799
they want to chat about things and you

304
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,659
know sometimes there's opposing stories

305
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,359
to it and sometimes the people like you

306
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:53,399
said are just secretive and older and

307
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,278
don't care

308
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,379
yeah you know yeah it's um like I can

309
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:02,519
tell you a story what how about Romulan

310
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:04,620
Joe told me um okay he's uh he uh

311
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,480
he was a new grower from Eastern Canada

312
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,700
moved to Vancouver Island it's outside

313
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,220
of Victoria and

314
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,100
um he was taken under the the wing of

315
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,500
some of the old-timers back then um in

316
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,200
the would have been in the late 80s late

317
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,299
mid 80s but uh when he first encountered

318
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,320
the Romulan it was a couple older

319
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,019
fellows

320
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,899
um now I think one of them's passed

321
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,899
um and they started off growing they

322
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,778
were pre uh Korean war vets they moved

323
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,399
back to Canada uh into the Cannabis and

324
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,980
all they had was Mexican and Colombian

325
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,000
and they started trying to breed with

326
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,639
that

327
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,339
um and they had very very little luck

328
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,319
small buds but they got faster and

329
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,300
faster breeding but it was still

330
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,459
basically sativa like the Colombian red

331
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,099
and uh

332
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:56,578
and then in the early 80s I believe it

333
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,560
was 82 or 83 uh when the first afghanis

334
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:00,539
started coming over

335
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,578
and they crossed out their variety that

336
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,278
they've been working on with uh an

337
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:10,039
Afghani and then they get a massive grow

338
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:12,659
out I believe in 84. okay and um

339
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,919
it shortened it made it workable that

340
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,659
they could grow in greenhouses they

341
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,219
never really had lights going back then

342
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,319
it was all in greenhouses on the South

343
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,139
Island

344
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,480
and there there was a runt of the batch

345
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,799
that they kept the cutting of it was the

346
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,420
smallest plant in the room they said

347
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:31,379
kind of the most finicky as well as far

348
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:33,059
as pH goes uh but it was so extremely

349
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,820
strong

350
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:38,939
um and they kept that cut from 94. or

351
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,540
I'm sorry pardon me 84 1984 yeah

352
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,560
and um and

353
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,360
they never even actually the first few

354
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,119
years he said they never even gave it a

355
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,060
name never had a name and that makes

356
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,399
sense Romulan Romney and Joe said you

357
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,078
know it's the late 80s when he was

358
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,259
sitting around helping them trim one day

359
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,939
and they're watching TV trimming and

360
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,799
they were watching Star Trek and they

361
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,380
started joking about how

362
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,859
this stuff will knock a put a dent in

363
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:10,019
your head just like a Romulan

364
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,120
and that was when the first first got

365
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,379
coin dies or Romulan and it just kind of

366
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,039
stuck from there

367
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:19,740
I love how these names that's the story

368
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:23,699
uh Joe's told me so that's awesome

369
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,500
that's great I can I can confirm even

370
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,278
now I'm doing some grow outs uh with

371
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,799
some Colombian genetics and I noticed a

372
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,659
lot with um the structure has absolutely

373
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,759
nothing to like the old school sativas

374
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:37,439
but the the high that you get from that

375
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,778
Romulan it was like a lot of the

376
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,240
different uh the couple Colombian Reds

377
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:46,439
that I've grown and the punto Rojo it's

378
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,959
a very very similar smell and high but

379
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,420
obviously nothing close to the same

380
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,039
growth structure but the flavor really

381
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:54,838
reminds me of the Colombian red that I'm

382
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,299
growing right now

383
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,260
um with the Romulan like a squat little

384
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:00,719
thing

385
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:03,299
very squat so it was one of the more

386
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,540
Afghani type structure selections yes

387
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:09,240
yes and and low yield as well but uh

388
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:11,278
after we after we did about five or six

389
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,000
back crosses into it

390
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,980
um

391
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,639
we noticed every time we used our uh

392
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,339
mostly Romulan mail on a female of

393
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,820
another variety that that smell and

394
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:26,399
potency would come across uh wow and the

395
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,959
structure would follow the female and

396
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,958
but he did it the other way around and

397
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,939
used the original Romulan as the female

398
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:36,259
it it was not it was a lot more unstable

399
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,680
it was it was uh

400
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:39,679
some patterns

401
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,000
that's super important we've actually

402
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:47,759
talked for a long time amongst our crew

403
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,679
like as a running joke kind of how when

404
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,299
you're breeding you're looking at things

405
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,338
and there's all these big impressive

406
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:56,039
plants that throw the kind of structure

407
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,720
and Bud you want all over the place and

408
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,159
then there's this like little runt

409
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,800
mutant thing that you think about

410
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,319
killing a number of times and that thing

411
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,139
ends up being the clear winner over

412
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,480
everything yeah and so it's like it's

413
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,459
it's an Ode to runs and it's an Ode to

414
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,399
like mutants and stuff like that because

415
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:16,559
often from a production standpoint all

416
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,019
the qualities you're looking for

417
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:22,259
you don't find the quality of smoke and

418
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,720
effect very often in those you find them

419
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,000
much more often in the weird ones

420
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,800
yeah

421
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,480
I am shocked to have the foresight to

422
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,519
like know to keep the runt because like

423
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,800
even back then a lot of the old wives

424
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,419
tales were yeah killed the the unsturdy

425
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,219
ones killed it you know as fast as you

426
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:39,719
can get those ones out of there you know

427
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,519
as a Seedling then people would be

428
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,959
killing the runs so I I think that's

429
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,740
awesome they had the foresight to know

430
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,719
that

431
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,159
what you see isn't necessarily what

432
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,980
you're gonna get in the end it may have

433
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:53,278
other traits that are really amazing

434
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,139
especially with indoors I've learned

435
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,240
that as well with indoors you don't get

436
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,919
away rid of the runs right away uh with

437
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,019
Outdoors you're looking for more outdoor

438
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,539
Vigor so you'll kind of call them pretty

439
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:06,000
quickly but for indoors now you gotta

440
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:08,159
wait and see what they can do yeah we

441
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,959
wouldn't have things like OG KB or Urkel

442
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,400
any of the weird stuff you know if we if

443
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,779
we didn't keep the runs around the

444
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,179
weirdos

445
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,318
yeah so I mean you know effect is

446
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,959
invisible

447
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,240
yeah and that's kind of one of the weird

448
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,160
things about cannabis is is until you

449
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,959
can actually dry it and cure it and

450
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,860
smoke it you really don't know what you

451
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,959
have

452
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,959
you don't know if the if the way it

453
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,700
smells translates into the way it tastes

454
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,679
you know you definitely don't know how

455
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,679
what effect it's going to give you so

456
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,740
you can learn some things by watching

457
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,480
but it kind of takes dried flour or hash

458
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,740
to kind of get you to where you want to

459
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,660
be with it

460
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,140
so yeah to give you the proper feedback

461
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,140
definitely

462
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,319
rings did you want to try that on

463
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,340
Romulan oh I was just thinking about

464
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:59,460
when I made seeds I have a doll was

465
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,599
the mic is messed up again yeah

466
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,058
okay

467
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,178
you see the time it's in the 8 17

468
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:08,099
something does it work no

469
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,200
no you gotta I mean we can hear you it

470
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:11,819
just comes with it with a nice car and I

471
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,880
can't remove the Crackle

472
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:17,178
I can't remove that in editing at all

473
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,179
no no

474
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,759
um

475
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,038
testing testing one two three yeah I

476
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,700
have no idea it's a messed

477
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,700
hmm

478
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:31,558
all right all right Rings you're getting

479
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:33,119
a boot to get a mic yeah that's fine I

480
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,839
appreciate you stopping by to help dude

481
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,839
I really do

482
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,279
later on

483
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,080
we wanted to have rings because he had

484
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,879
my he he lives actually down the street

485
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,099
from me and he has a ton of experience

486
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
growing your work

487
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,839
um he's a big Next Generation fan

488
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,240
massive over the he's always been a

489
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,038
outdoor from seed kind of guy not that

490
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,558
he doesn't do indoor

491
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,900
um but he never really got huge into the

492
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,178
Clone thing although he does keep clones

493
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,798
he always likes growing from seed and

494
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,259
breeding every year

495
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,000
so out of the three of us he probably

496
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,640
had the most experience in actually

497
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,740
growing out stuff you've made and seeing

498

501
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,779
that's what I want to go over with you

502
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,460

503
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,418
thing that people were asking oh you're

504

gonna get you're going to get someone

505
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,900
who knows about Federation we want to

506
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,279
know about these specific strains so if

507
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,320
you want if I can run through these with

508
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,000
you real quick just say kind of first

509
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,740
first few sentences that come to your

more detail on any feel free uh Mikado

512
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,400
um that was basically our version of the

513
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:47,339
uh sweet Pig grapefruit oh okay very

514
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,380
cool yeah it was basically our uh semi

515
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:50,699
it was F4 when we released it F4 back

516
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,960
cross

517
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,919
um but that yeah it's basically the

518
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,860
grapefruit

519
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,320
that's awesome uh Dynamite

520
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:00,719
is that next Generation that's the next

521
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,859
Dynamite is next Generation but when I

522
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,779
left Federation I renamed it uh Dynamite

523
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:09,119
uh instead of calling it Mikado or

524
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,279
grapefruit because

525
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,159
people were upset about if you're using

526
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,960
somebody else's name oh God you can't

527
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,740
call it grapefruit or I'm going to send

528
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,940
somebody to visit you type of thing yeah

529
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,279
change the name but I wrote it in my

530
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,140
description this is our version of the

531
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,759
original grapefruit yeah so I mean

532
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,880
what's about the best you can do at that

533
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,440
point I mean yeah well at first when I

534
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,780
released it instead of calling I called

535
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,700
it grapefruit and yeah I said this is

536
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:38,759
the grapefruit first made famous by

537
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,740
breeder Steve of uh spice of life uh I

538
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,298
just I was giving him credit and letting

539
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,480
people know where and I was kind of

540
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:47,038
naive I guess yeah and then he got upset

541
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,480
saying oh wow if you're using that name

542
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,480
you owe me money I'm like well

543
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:56,939
yeah yeah yeah

544
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,739
all right I'll change the names so as

545
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,200
you learn your way through toe stepping

546
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,538
in in the seed world there's no written

547
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,160
rules it's like each person has their

548
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,859
own rules and you better know it ahead

549
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,900
of time or else it's interesting because

550
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:12,719
so many name changes happened either

551
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,000
from just that very thing where you

552
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,919
change seed companies and somebody has a

553
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,679
trademark or there's they get upset

554
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,360
about the same name or in some cases

555
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,000
like a little on a little shadier note

556
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,339
uh seed breeders don't want people to

557
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,259
know the origin stock of what they're

558
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,519
releasing because they don't want to

559
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:31,079
give credit and they don't want to give

560
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,418
a percentage or they don't want to deal

561
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,759
with any Bulls so they just like make up

562
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:40,440
their own name and then there you go

563
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,940
again I I was like yeah oh go ahead yeah

564
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,038
I always like to give credit to where

565
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,140
I've how what I created it from because

566
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,599
everything we have was built on somebody

567
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,220
else's work that came before us

568
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,658
um and it's just just a matter of

569
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,079
letting people know and being honest

570
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:56,640
about it it was I was my philosophy

571
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,259
behind it but yeah there is a lot of

572
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,520
people a lot of strains nowadays you

573
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:02,419
know that there's something in there

574
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:05,220
that they're not telling you yeah

575
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:07,620
probably a lot in the states without

576
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,960
yeah oh God it's been that way for

577
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:13,319
forever I mean we've even talked about

578
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,720
it how like in uh you know Neville would

579
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,819
just say what things were in Europe and

580
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,860
everybody that came after him in Holland

581
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:22,139
kind of obscured things

582
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,819
and one of the things I want to like

583
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,220
Matt and I did like a kind of a two-part

584
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:28,740
thing on the history of uh of seed banks

585
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,538
and when we got to Canada we realized we

586
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,700
didn't know enough about the internal

587
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:35,940
Dynamics to like talk intelligently

588
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,679
about it but I definitely come from that

589
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,380
era where like say looking at like Mark

590
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,580
Emery's magazine you know you would open

591
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,260
those up and you would see those

592
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:45,298
catalogs and you would see all the

593
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,700
traditional Amsterdam stuff that they

594
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:49,980
brought over and were reselling but then

595
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,538
you know there would be

596
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,279
um you know there would be all these

597
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,460
five or six different new Canadian

598
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,418
companies

599
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,159
I like

600
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,679
yeah a lot of the stuff that came over

601
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,840
from this from Holland then after I I

602
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,000
know some of the guys that were doing

603
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,538
all the moving of the seeds over Yeah

604
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,819
Yeah by Mark and you can guarantee that

605
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:14,519
a lot of those genetics are not what it

606
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,960
says on the package uh when it comes to

607
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,900
the Dutch when it comes to all this

608
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,000
imported Dutch stuff back in those days

609
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,240
um but as far as the Canadian uh

610
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,319
homegrown companies um they're that was

611
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,220
pretty much straight up and pretty

612
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,599
honest

613
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,220
um yeah and because people were doing

614
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,158
their own thing there was guys in the

615
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,740
Kootenays there's the mighty might boys

616
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:36,840
uh Vancouver Island Seed Company and a

617
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,480
few of the others that they were giving

618
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,859
you what it says on the package um but

619
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,140
not so much with the Dutch stuff the

620
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,639
Dutch would even joke sometimes when

621
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,500
they're selling to Canadians in bulk

622
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,240
that they just go to the back room and

623
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,919
they have their Indica bucket and their

624
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,839
sativa bucket and they come out I've

625
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,280
told people this for years yeah people

626
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,139
don't believe me when I say this they

627
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,178
really did like they're like What's

628
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,740
closer to Jack Herer uh there's Stone

629
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,480
case yeah there's a [ __ ] close enough

630
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,980
they won't know yeah yeah that's enough

631
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,679
they won't know yeah

632
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,179
that's it is it really is how it went or

633
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,340
just you know like somebody like we've

634
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,980
heard people talk about how like Mark

635
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:12,839
Emery would get quarters for seeds and

636
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,700
have run out of the particular thing

637
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,678
that they had requested but he still

638
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,200
wanted to make the money so he's like oh

639
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,280
this is close enough

640
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,640
yeah he'll buy it off one of the local

641
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,558
guys and then uh and then repackage it

642
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,480
yeah yeah

643
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:29,339
yeah that's pretty typical I was never

644
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,720
back in those days Mark Emery never had

645
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:33,119
anything in original packaging because

646
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,759
everything was smuggled and none of us

647
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,219
seed breeders were organized enough to

648
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,859
to make packaging and you're right yeah

649
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,140
it's a risky thing to do back then it

650
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:44,658
was yeah you got the new shop that would

651
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,340
you know

652
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:49,020
packaging in your house for proof you

653
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:51,418
know that's bad you get caught a lot of

654
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:54,058
people my age would get those magazines

655
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:57,900
and would literally pour over every

656
00:24:54,058 --> 00:25:00,000
single blurb about each of the seeds and

657
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,798
create lists of dreams that you wanted

658
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,960
because it it was kind of like

659
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:06,538
pre-internet or very early internet as

660
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,000
far as forums go and so information was

661
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,798
limited and so when the Canadian seed

662
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,440
breeders kind of came on the scene at

663
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,940
least as far as access for Americans all

664
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,860
of a sudden there was this plethora of

665
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,019
new stuff

666
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,058
you know that like you were like oh what

667
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,960
about this or what about that or on some

668
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,480
of this

669
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,480
and uh you know yeah

670
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,500
purple stuff coming from Canada too

671
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,140
because I was a purple fiend and I

672
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,778
remember Federation Next Generation

673
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,759
Um there was one great white Seed Co

674
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:40,319
maybe a great North that had a lethal

675
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:41,579
purple or something yeah that's all

676
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,399
kinds

677
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:47,278
yeah white Grizzly they did a few of the

678
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,740
cootie breeders yeah yeah there's one

679
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,200
guy from um the Kootenays that used to

680
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,538
work with Steve uh he goes by kootene Og

681
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,519
on Instagram I want to give him a shout

682
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:58,679
out he was great man he's a great dude

683
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,240
yeah I mean you know Matt there's even

684
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,580
rumors I don't know if I believe them or

685
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,220
not but there's a story in in Mendocino

686
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:08,099
in my area that some of the early

687
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,159
purples that came over and became famous

688
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:13,619
in my neck of the woods had some

689
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,740
Canadian Origins to them yeah I've never

690
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:18,778
been able to verify if that was true

691
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,400
um but some of that purple skunk some of

692
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:22,319
those purples especially some of the

693
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,080
stuff that was growing up there in BC

694
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:29,819
indoor scene stuff like that there are

695
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,619
there are some old rumors of Origins

696
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,298
um and that's one of the reasons why the

697
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,219
stories have never come out about like

698
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:37,500
which person in Humboldt or Mendo or

699
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,259
whatever actually made it because it

700
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,359
kind of came down from Canada

701
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:43,740
um you know before Osama Bin Laden

702
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,119
ruined flying

703
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,159
yeah because there was a big difference

704
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:51,359
one of the things I was thinking about

705
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,679
when uh Jay was talking was that just I

706
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,599
mean obviously we're all we're North

707
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,700
Americans right so you've got the

708
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,918
Canadian side and the and the American

709
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,200
side and there's these two big weed

710
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,000
cultures but they have differences but

711
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,460
there's this Border in between

712
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,839
and sometimes the Canadians aren't very

713
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,360
friendly with letting in certain

714
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:12,359
Americans depending on their past you

715
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,099
know and vice versa and uh and you know

716
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:16,859
and then but it was more porous in the

717
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:19,439
90s and then after the terrorist attacks

718
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,399
happened they really tightened up the

719
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,080
Border

720
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,778
yeah and they really made it more

721
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,939
difficult for interaction you know

722
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:29,038
especially that yeah five or two years

723
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,440
after it happened

724
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,839
see you know even mailing seed or

725
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,900
getting over the Border or exchange of

726
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,359
plant matter or what have you uh became

727
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,179
a lot dicier than it was before

728
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,979
you know uh before we had a lot of a lot

729
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,419
of problems yeah

730
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,860
yeah I mean before they were kind of

731
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:48,299
worried about Mexico

732
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:49,259
but they weren't really worried about

733
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:51,599
Canada

734
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,339
so Canada the Border was kind of like ah

735
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,500
you know it's Americans and Canadians

736
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,939
are just crossing and then they took it

737
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,099
a little bit more serious because they

738
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,100
got worried about people using that like

739
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:04,678
porous nature to get in and it made weed

740
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:07,558
it made the weed game a little different

741
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:11,159
I think well I remember

742
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:14,099
I remember uh when uh back in John

743
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,740
Walters was the drug czar right before 9

744
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:17,939
11 or right around then uh but actually

745
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,640
it was before that it was still in the

746
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,140
late 90s um and Mark Emery had been

747
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,120
getting busted over and over again and

748
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,720
he loved being in the media he was on

749
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:31,019
CNN news and our hot springs all the

750
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,778
time and and we get raided all the time

751
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,460
and I remember one year after a second

752
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,298
or third bust

753
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,100
um

754
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:40,400
they came in and the drug czar said

755
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:43,619
we're taking down these Canadian

756
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:47,278
seed cartels they call them seed cartels

757
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:49,139
and all the seed cartels in Canada are

758
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,819
the equivalent to Narco terrorists every

759
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,980
seed they sell is a thousand dollars

760
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:54,119
worth of marijuana on the American

761
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,480
Street

762
00:28:54,119 --> 00:29:00,178
and I remember Mark Emery he held a huge

763
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,620
party when uh he when we got called

764
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:06,240
Narco narco-terrorists oh my God and he

765
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,678
Mark Emery took that as a great

766
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,640
compliment and he threw one of the

767
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,919
biggest parties we ever had oh my God

768
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,240
you know I probably would do the same I

769
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,860
probably would do the same but it would

770
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,298
I would regret it but I probably would

771
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:21,359
have done the same like in that area

772
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:23,700
just I mean there's a reason there's a

773
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,199
reason why a lot of the old-timers who

774
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,778
are free

775
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,720
um you know chose silence and secrecy

776
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:32,339
yeah because you know being invisible is

777
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,740
a real superpower

778
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:37,678
you know uh once they Shine the Light on

779
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,720
you it's pretty bright

780
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,880
yeah and a lot of the old Growers like

781
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,860
uh G-Man they're from Vancouver Island

782
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,480
Seed cup a lot of these guys too they

783
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:48,538
started back in the 80s where you could

784
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,339
do serious time uh oh yeah and we have

785
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:53,460
yeah and they unlock more other things

786
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:55,619
to lose as well businesses and family so

787
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,259
they were just used to not

788
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,298
even still just they still don't talk

789
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:02,640
about it yeah

790
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,500
that's how you're conditioned so

791
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,179
do you have more on your list Matt that

792
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,980
we kind of got sidetracked or whatever

793
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:10,259
but maybe we could tangent back to it

794
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,759
and you could ask Celestial Temple

795
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:15,658
sativa

796
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:19,379
ah yes that was that was very nice it

797
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:22,460
was very um supposedly the rumor was it

798
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,460
was seeds from Ecuador

799
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,339
um very nice we crossed that when we

800
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:28,200
first released that it was a a

801
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:31,319
grapefruit F4 male

802
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,319
in Federation we use that as the male

803
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:36,359
that pollinated this Equity

804
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:38,278
extremely nice strain um

805
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:40,379
it was lost it ended up in one of my

806
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:43,819
collections that uh ended up being lost

807
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,820
in a in a divorce

808
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,380
yeah I lost half my seat collection uh

809
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,580
in the divorce and that was one of the

810
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,860
strains I lost

811
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:54,480
um but yeah very very nice straight if

812
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:56,398
anybody still has genetics of that

813
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,798
kicking around that would be very uh

814
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,239
we'll put our ears out

815
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,158
yeah

816
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,599
we have a Long Reach with the show like

817
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,039
you like we were just talking about

818
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,959
early Pearl the other day and someone's

819
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,298
like yeah I got f2s F6 yeah you know but

820
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,340
and they're legit ones so that's it's

821
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:12,418
kind of neat how that works

822
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:15,439
um

823
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,440
BC Kush

824
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,240
yeah um I'm not exactly sure where that

825
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:23,460
came from it came from um uh the Asian

826
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,339
community in Vancouver when I got the

827
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,159
the cut and there's rumors that it was a

828
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:31,319
big bud but it was just so extremely uh

829
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,080
I know the best way to

830
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:36,720
that's why it's like creamy a creamy

831
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,178
creamy smooth flavor it would get you

832
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,038
nice and high but not a confusing eye I

833
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,380
considered it for myself daytime smoke

834
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:46,079
sure like I could still function I can

835
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,520
still do math I can still drive it

836
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,839
sounds like it sounds like a girl type

837
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,240
High

838
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,678
yeah yeah and in a way actually but um

839
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,620
yeah but it was nice and round and

840
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,200
bulbous was it super dense too like Mega

841
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:00,778
dense yes yes very dense

842
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,159
very dense but not not the stinkiest

843
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:03,898
drain drawing that's why a lot of the

844
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,299
Asian production Growers liked it

845
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:07,918
because it would get very huge and not

846
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:10,558
stink out the whole neighborhood like a

847
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,759
lot of the other varieties not be a big

848
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,460
red flag

849
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:18,058
yeah this is back today have a really

850
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,880
hard time accepting that a lot that a

851
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:22,379
lot of old famous things uh to use a

852
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,880
term that's very common today weren't

853
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,120
very terpy

854
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,860
that low smell low odor was actually a

855
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,119
big benefit

856
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:32,278
um because you definitely didn't want to

857
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,199
pull up to your spot and get out of your

858
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:36,839
car and smell it before you went into

859
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,960
the building so people used to think of

860
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,418
low odor and and you know low terpenes

861
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,519
or whatever as sometimes a benefit

862
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,620
you know a lot of the production growers

863
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,898
in the city yes that's exactly right for

864
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:51,538
the if you're a production grower in the

865
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:53,278
city uh growing something for export but

866
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:54,240
most of the good old boys living in the

867
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,058
country

868
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,819
we wanted the Turks we wanted the flavor

869
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:02,278
um yeah yeah and another part of it too

870
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:04,798
is that you know if you got a big

871
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:07,319
yielding resinous thick dense thing that

872
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:10,259
smelled like nothing you could safely

873
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:12,439
cross that to something much terpier and

874
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:15,000
hope that those terpenes crossed over

875
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,580
and would show up because they it

876
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,200
wouldn't have any Terps to interfere so

877
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:21,240
you were looking for like the resin and

878
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,278
the density and the production and

879
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,200
hoping that the effect and the flavor

880
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,398
came over from the other side of the

881
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,080
thing

882
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,000
that's exactly what we did with our

883
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,699
Romulan we used when we made the Romulan

884
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,220
BC cushcross used the male from their

885
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,038
Romulan and a lot of Lent a lot of the

886
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,019
potency uh and a lot of the smell but it

887
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:40,798
kept with that BC Kush size

888
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,740
um

889
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,658
yeah very very nice way to that was a

890
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,759
nice cross I still I still produce it

891
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:51,059
but I don't have the original BC Kush

892
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,158
cut anymore but that's yeah I still

893
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:55,079
produce a version of it so

894
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,000
that's cool that you've you've found a

895
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:59,460
way to keep your lines going even when

896
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,960
stuff gets lost you know your lines well

897
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,220
enough to be able to work them to get

898
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,140
them back to where you feel comfortable

899
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,000
saying this represents that line well

900
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,099
enough to be that line that's that's

901
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,199
right yeah there's still a few few

902
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:12,119
varieties I'd like to to get back but

903
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,838
haven't been able to

904
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,059
um

905
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:18,000
but uh what which ones yeah which ones

906
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:21,000
uh my Bonkers definitely my Bonkers

907
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,898
strain what was that one it was my it

908
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,780
was

909
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:26,579
it was one of the first trains I read on

910
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,879
a large scale Outdoors on Vancouver

911
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:32,279
Island and it was across uh the first

912
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:34,618
mail I used was a Burmese grapefruit

913
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,480
okay and that was the video and the

914
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:39,260
female was from uh

915
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,719
some growers in uh the Prairies of

916
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:45,599
Manitoba it was a purple [ __ ] it

917
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,819
was called crossed with uh uh early

918
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,919
sativa which is basically a very fast

919
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,720
version of the Durban that was is that

920
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,719
what early sativa was

921
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,719
one

922
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,400
maybe it was an actual Burger but that's

923
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,320
what it actually was and it was very

924
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,500
very lethal leafy just like yes

925
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,059
[ __ ] and the purple [ __ ]

926
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,780
um it was always grown from seed because

927
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:16,920
you couldn't keep it cut

928
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,500
the resonance on that between the

929
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,680
Burmese and the Resonance of the purple

930
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,019
[ __ ] uh it was just astounding

931
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,899
the the leaves even the fan leaves had

932
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:30,719
Crystal right out to the airs so when I

933
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,760
first made the first four-way cross and

934
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,439
I grew a massive crop on Vancouver

935
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,859
Island outdoors in one of the wettest

936
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,960
parts of the island and the buds only

937
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:42,719
they came out the size of footballs that

938
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,300
top Buds and even the smaller buds at

939
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,098
the bottom was the size of a pop cat

940
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,820
and uh

941
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:52,680
but just the production was just massive

942
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:56,099
but the first few years it was kind of

943
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:58,799
Airy yeah from the [ __ ] and the

944
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:00,480
early sativa and I grew in a wet part of

945
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,060
the island so I that first year I lost

946
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,719
about half of my crop to mold it was all

947
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:08,400
seated so I I selected uh my best seeds

948
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,500
and after about the third or fourth

949
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,639
generation of breeding that

950
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,619
into itself outdoors I was in the

951
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,559
wettest and wettest of years I was still

952
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:22,380
90 of plants had not a drop of botritis

953
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,239
or mold on them oh wow just from going

954
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,579
through the first few years of just

955
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,598
calling out those traits

956
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:30,780
um yeah

957
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,200
and it became really well known around

958
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,180
Canada anyway for the amount of resin

959
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,399
and the terpene level was through the

960
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:41,578
roof uh so a lot of people would use it

961
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,740
to make hash uh things like that and I

962
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,140
that's one strain I did lose as well

963
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:47,819
that I've had I've had customers come to

964
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,379
me and send me seeds say oh yeah I still

965
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,260
make your Bonkers so so they send me

966
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,358
some I try it out it's not like not not

967
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,740
like not like it was and I yeah the only

968
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:58,319
people that I know that actually have

969
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:01,199
scenes have been put away is uh Ari in a

970
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,480
greenhouse oh and yeah good luck on that

971
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,799
getting them back well my my business

972
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,320
partner is actually pretty decent

973
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,480
friends with them but he already is like

974
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,800
well I don't have I have so many seeds I

975
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,440
don't have time to go digging through

976
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,240
that or send an employee it's Lorien has

977
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,400
such a large catalog I can't even

978
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,739
imagine and when I first moved to

979
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,320
Holland and I get a seed trade with them

980
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:24,439
uh actually with Milo from uh who made

981
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,200
the cheese so I traded yeah yeah

982
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,358
with for the cheese and then Milo didn't

983
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,279
have uh time he ended up just giving

984
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:36,119
them to Ari and putting them in his

985
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,700
vault oh wow so that's the only place

986
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,539
that I know for sure that there's a good

987
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:41,819
uh

988
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:43,920
a good generation of it there stayed

989
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,859
away stored away so

990
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,780
man I'd love to know what's actually in

991
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:50,460
his vault and what it actually is you

992
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,500
know like some of that early early

993
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,260
silver Pearl stuff and early Pearl and

994
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,079
early girl get my hands on it yeah

995
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,880
basically every old original person I

996
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,740
would love to know what they still have

997
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,440
and what what their little seed Vault

998
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:06,299
contains yeah um because everyone claims

999
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,820
they have ever not everyone many people

1000
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,099
claim they have everything unchanged

1001
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,359
from the beginning and obviously as we

1002
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,800
all know the truth is a bit different

1003
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:15,960
than that

1004
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,579
um but pockets of stuff exist and some

1005
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,519
people are very generous and some people

1006
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:22,380
are like I have it and you don't and

1007
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:24,000
it's sitting there until I decide to do

1008
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,220
something with it

1009
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,480
well the one Dutch company that I have a

1010
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:29,879
lot respect a lot of respect for

1011
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,820
yourself The Flying Dutchman

1012
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,220
um I'm not sure uh Eddie

1013
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,619
I'm not I forget his name but I've tried

1014
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:40,078
a lot of his genetic back in the day and

1015
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,838
uh in Holland itself and in Europe he's

1016
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,940
got an extremely good reputation he's a

1017
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:46,980
few coffee shops where you can go and

1018
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,659
get the real strategy but yes this is

1019
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,240
the the real Master Kush from you know

1020
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:53,460
1983 or whenever it was and it's got the

1021
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,578
original Proper Cuts

1022
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,579
um

1023
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,059
is now just

1024
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:02,819
okay

1025
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:05,940
pot of gold and The Real McCoy from from

1026
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:09,240
them you know uh we found multiple

1027
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,519
really nice versions in those things

1028
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,578
um so yeah there was a time when uh I

1029
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,900
liked the Flying Dutchman quite a bit

1030
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:17,900
yeah I like vegetative

1031
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:22,680
yeah they were uh the original skunk

1032
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,500
cage crosses

1033
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,299
yeah and that's what my haze that I use

1034
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,300
in my grapefruit Haze cross my Romulan

1035
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:33,660
Haze is from that over 20 years ago yeah

1036
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,400
oh wow the Flying Dutchman scum case

1037
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:37,440
um your grapefruit Haze made it down to

1038
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,980
Southern California down to San Diego

1039
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,960
and um mid-2000s it was it got pretty

1040
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:47,000
big down there here guys great three

1041
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,039
days yeah yeah right closer to the

1042
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,900
2010 probably actually when I started

1043
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,300
seeing it at collectors but it got big

1044
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,579
down there it was pretty cool

1045
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,039
um cotton candy

1046
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:01,920
cotton candy every you know that's a

1047
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:04,800
special um well cotton candy Federation

1048
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,760
that was basically it's an F2 uh sweet

1049
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,539
tooth

1050
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,280
okay sweet tooth blueberry

1051
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:13,460
sweet Juice blueberry

1052
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,800
yep and then back

1053
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:19,519
yeah into the Sweet Tooth again so and

1054
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,680
you said it was sweet tooth number two

1055
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:25,079
specifically I if I remember correctly

1056
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:27,838
yes okay

1057
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,140
yeah we have for 25 years ago but

1058
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:33,358
yeah right Hawaiian sativa I think we

1059
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:35,699
went over that a little bit right yeah

1060
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,799
that was from um that was from Vancouver

1061
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:41,159
Island Seed Company yeah yeah it

1062
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,680
actually had I believe

1063
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:45,598
I believe that was an F3 back cross when

1064
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,480
we when we released it so probably 80

1065
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,160
something percent Hawaiian sativa yeah

1066
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,960
an old Afghan I mean

1067
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,519
um and that's another I do have a

1068
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,800
Hawaiian sativa now it's not quite like

1069
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,059
the original back then

1070
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,820
um I wish I had something a little

1071
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:02,578
closer but uh

1072
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,019
yeah reproduce those buddy just

1073
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,519
reproduced those I'm sure he'd be happy

1074
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:06,838
to send you some of the reproduction up

1075
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,858
and see if it's anything like the

1076
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:09,838
original

1077
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:11,519
yeah yeah actually for man was saying

1078
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,338
the same thing because brieferman's down

1079
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,199
in Jamaica right now and he's he's

1080
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:18,838
trying to bring back uh the old Lamb's

1081
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:21,719
breath and he's testing out all these

1082
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,799
other sativa varieties in Jamaica and

1083
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,078
when I was chatting with him the other

1084
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,240
day he mentioned uh that he had some of

1085
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,820
these old client sativas as well

1086
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:32,219
are we talking about old reefer man or

1087
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,119
new reefer man

1088
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:36,719
um

1089
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,539
I didn't know there was yes CS

1090
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,219
oh yes yep that's okay okay

1091
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,800
yeah yeah that someone else owns a

1092
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:46,739
company now so he okay I think it's

1093
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,579
maybe a family member up in Canada yeah

1094
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:49,739
yeah

1095
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:53,240
I'm not sure yeah

1096
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:53,239
um uh Island sweet skunk

1097
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,800
um that's still one of my best sellers

1098
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,358
um yeah I bet that's a good one it's uh

1099
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,039
you know I've had that one from day one

1100
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:04,819
that was the sweet skunk number four

1101
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:07,920
from spice of life

1102
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,019
that first year when Steve made the uh

1103
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,519
sweet skunk there was about three or

1104
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:13,619
four different cuts that he selected

1105
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,079
that went around for a few years and

1106
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:19,019
this was the most sativa phenotype out

1107
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,180
of all of them okay Captain started

1108
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:22,858
working with uh

1109
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:24,659
yeah it's still one of my favorites

1110
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:25,440
still one of my best yielding strains as

1111
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:28,519
well

1112
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,519
but uh

1113
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,380
would you consider it hazy

1114
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,500
yes in flavor yes yeah

1115
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,140
definitely a real lemony

1116
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,719
hazy like similarities to some of the

1117
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:44,519
super silver hazes even yeah yeah or the

1118
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,439
Jacksonville mirrors yeah

1119
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,480
that makes sense and we've heard that

1120
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,820
we've heard that it's like uh it's based

1121
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,440
on nl5 Haze but I mean we hear different

1122
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,180
things from different Canadians that's

1123
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,318
one of the rumors

1124
00:42:54,179 --> 00:43:00,618
um and you'd have to ask uh Steve or uh

1125
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:02,579
uh uh red uh yeah yeah

1126
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:04,800
you would probably know a little bit

1127
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,500
more than me about the exact background

1128
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,740
of it

1129
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:13,139
received one of the Clones uh in 96 so

1130
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:14,879
sure exactly wake up but yeah I heard

1131
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:16,858
also heard that the rumor that's NL

1132
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,358
Hayes

1133
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:21,119
so there's lots of good stuff that came

1134
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:22,920
from nl5 Haze and it just made me

1135
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,420
mention that too because when you said

1136
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,338
it was like one of the haze when it's

1137
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,380
one of the most sativa ones and it

1138
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:30,420
tasted a lot very similar to those

1139
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,280
things you know it doesn't mean it's

1140
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,559
true but it like it definitely lends

1141
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,200
some some points to it maybe

1142
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,480
yeah and one thing I kind of wanted to

1143
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,338
mention just real quick because I think

1144
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,440
it's interesting is

1145
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:46,559
you know we I was talking about the line

1146
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,838
between Canada and America obviously but

1147
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,119
as America starts to legalize in all

1148
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:53,039
these different states especially like

1149
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,960
on the east coast and the and the you

1150
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,400
know New England and New York and some

1151
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,039
of these areas that are a lot wetter

1152
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,559
they keep trying to import California

1153
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,659
bread strains which got developed in a

1154
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:07,440
very arid climate and I've always

1155
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:10,019
thought that people north of the Border

1156
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,519
will probably have genetics like when

1157
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:13,800
you were talking about like oh I was

1158
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,318
growing on the rainiest ass part of this

1159
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,940
island and we were breeding for it and

1160
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,099
by three or four years in we got some

1161
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,599
stuff that was resistant

1162
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:23,039
um you know in the west coast we don't

1163
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,579
have very much of that because it never

1164
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,079
rains in summer

1165
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:31,019
Oregon State or Washington State yeah

1166
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,119
yeah but in California I mean but in you

1167
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:35,099
know places like New York and on the

1168
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,380
East Coast where summer is very humid

1169
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:39,900
they're probably going to end up wanting

1170
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,760
to breed in Canadian work

1171
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,680
into their stuff

1172
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,859
because a lot of that stuff will have

1173
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,919
resistances

1174
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:51,900
definitely uh my uh a colleague of mine

1175
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,619
here that runs that Golden Hat Seed

1176
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,019
Company

1177
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,940
um he's originally from Oregon Mr Ron

1178
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:59,039
Harrington and he uh this last summer

1179
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,318
did a massive grow out with a bunch of

1180
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:04,619
uh American Auto flowers

1181
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:07,199
okay right next to some of mine and some

1182
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,660
of his and he said most of the American

1183
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,759
red ones that were from California or

1184
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:14,578
Colorado or a few of these other places

1185
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,940
he said they just were inundated with

1186
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:20,818
moles and botritis yeah Meanwhile my

1187
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,159
varieties of autoflowers were you said

1188
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:25,858
not a drop of mold on them

1189
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:28,559
um and that goes back to yeah it picks

1190
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:30,139
up those traits after years of selecting

1191
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,519
um

1192
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:35,219
because if you have to

1193
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:37,079
nobody wants to lose 50 to 75 percent of

1194
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:39,480
their crop to rot so you start breeding

1195
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,519
with the ones that survived it and like

1196
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,838
I said my third fourth generation you

1197
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,039
get to a point where you don't have a

1198
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:46,858
speck of it

1199
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:48,420
yeah exactly it's hard in California to

1200
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:50,578
breed for those traits because it

1201
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,159
doesn't rain in summer

1202
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:55,260
so you don't have humidity

1203
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,899
yeah

1204
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,540
I noticed that too I lived for uh for

1205
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,460
nine years I lived in Spain and it's a

1206
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:05,940
similar latitude as Northern California

1207
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,440
around San Francisco except in Spain the

1208
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,599
difference is they have really high

1209
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,099
humidity

1210
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,920
um so a lot of my varieties did really

1211
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:16,140
well there uh yeah it was really neat to

1212
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,420
grow uh my strains down at a completely

1213
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:21,239
different climate but all everywhere

1214
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,039
I've grown long term has been very humid

1215
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:25,858
uh because the coast of Valencia there

1216
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:29,400
where I lived it's it's regularly 70 80

1217
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:34,699
humidity uh and 35 degrees outside

1218
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,700
Celsius right so uh

1219
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,160
yeah right now where I'm living in uh

1220
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,200
Alberta Canada it's very dry so this is

1221
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:47,460
probably the driest climate I've grown

1222
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,500
in yeah in my whole 25 years of growing

1223
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,358
um and I I miss I miss growing in a

1224
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,239
human climate sometimes it's hard for me

1225
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:57,598
to get my rooms up past over past uh 40

1226
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,759
humidity in my indoor grow rooms and it

1227
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,338
it's really hard to dry and you cure

1228
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,859
your butt here in this climate as well

1229
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:08,639
yeah I I have good friends in Colorado

1230
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:11,039
who have similar dryness issues and and

1231
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,920
keeping their dry rooms moist enough for

1232
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,139
long enough so you get that slow dry you

1233
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,700
know um and your weed doesn't turn into

1234
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:20,940
dust

1235
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:23,039
um dryness is a huge a huge positive in

1236
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,920
my opinion once you get late into flower

1237
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,920
but when you're early in veg I think

1238
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,139
more humidity is actually helpful to get

1239
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,480
small plants to vigorously grow because

1240
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:37,019
they don't dry out and crisp

1241
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,179
definitely that my if my uh bedroom goes

1242
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:40,619
up in humidity I I don't worry about it

1243
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:43,559
at all

1244
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:45,000
um yeah but in the flower room the dryer

1245
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,219
I can get it the better

1246
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,460
yeah

1247
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:52,919
all right UBC chemo back to the list oh

1248
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,019
yeah like UBC chemo I don't know

1249
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,659
anything about chemo

1250
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:59,759
I I grew it for a few years I ended up

1251
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:01,858
dropping it uh I just was never

1252
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,859
impressed with it it

1253
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:06,239
some people loved it uh I thought it was

1254
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:09,659
a way overrated

1255
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:11,699
yeah a lot of brown hair no resin

1256
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:13,559
just not I'm not particularly fond of

1257
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:16,559
that earthy flavor of strain it's not

1258
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:18,299
something I like myself I like the spicy

1259
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,358
or the fruity strains

1260
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:24,000
it was just very dull tasting to me so

1261
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,858
after I started Next Generation

1262
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,199
Um I didn't that was one of the Clones I

1263
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:30,299
dropped yeah so there's other people

1264
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:32,219
that would know more than me about that

1265
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:37,579
one

1266
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:37,578
um how about uh time warp

1267
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:45,059
um very very underrated uh very

1268
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:46,858
impressive strain okay very underrated I

1269
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:49,019
think I have a jar left here actually I

1270
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:50,639
was smoking something nice

1271
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:52,858
um what's it taste like and smell like

1272
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:56,519
what's the the Turkey um

1273
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:59,818
slightly Piney a little like a floral uh

1274
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:02,099
perfumey in some ways okay yeah

1275
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:04,380
um and I think one of the reasons that

1276
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,960
it stuck around for so long on in in

1277
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,519
British Columbia was uh it's one of

1278
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,818
those strains that

1279
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:14,099
uh you can store for long periods and

1280
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:16,559
it'll keep its flavor it doesn't leave

1281
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:18,059
the uh lose the terpenes so it's when

1282
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,059
everybody's harvesting in September and

1283
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:23,279
October the prices obviously go down for

1284
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:25,559
when you're selling your weed so Time

1285
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,720
Warp is one of those you can dry it pop

1286
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:30,599
it in the freezer and six months later

1287
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:32,578
or next summer when it's dry you can

1288
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,800
pull it out and it'll sell smells just

1289
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:38,039
as fresh as the day you put it in wow

1290
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,440
and that's a good good trait that is

1291
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:42,179
very good yeah and it was just really

1292
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,139
nice to smoke right I know it wasn't the

1293
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,940
strongest

1294
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:47,098
straight but I would guesstimate because

1295
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,960
we never did test back then I would

1296
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:51,720
guess around eight

1297
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,358
17 to 20 somewhere in there okay what

1298
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:56,519
percentage uh hitting 20 might be a

1299
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:57,598
little hard but yeah in that in that

1300
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:59,759
zone

1301
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,680
um yeah and I actually I'm bringing that

1302
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,380
one back because I lost that's not I

1303
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,940
lost that original cut as well

1304
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:09,059
um supposedly it's still out there but I

1305
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:11,220
had lots of F5 and F6 uh crosses that I

1306
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:13,139
had so like in the last few years I've

1307
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:15,239
been doing selecting

1308
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:17,578
to get it back to uh close to the

1309
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:19,979
original and so now I have two different

1310
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:22,519
versions of it I have uh the one that's

1311
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:25,079
very similar to the original

1312
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:27,960
and I have one that is similar to the

1313
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:29,579
original but a lot larger and what's

1314
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,539
what are they called

1315
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:37,880
uh well just Time Warp and Time Warp XL

1316
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:41,279
okay basically and uh the XL should be

1317
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,380
on our website in a few weeks oh awesome

1318
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,760
uh the original will be ready just in

1319
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,858
time for spring

1320
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,319
uh hopefully by by April we'll have the

1321
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:52,019
the original time mark back

1322
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:54,000
that's pretty cool

1323
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:55,920
I've always wanted to try it but I

1324
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,159
noticed like whenever whenever I was

1325
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,079
young and I was buying um like outdoor

1326
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:02,399
strains trying to grow them indoor it

1327
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,039
was it was actually harder to bring

1328
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,838
outdoor strains indoor for me you know

1329
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,119
like I would always hurt them unless

1330
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,699
unless I started like keeping a clone of

1331
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,559
one and running it several Generations

1332
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:15,239
as it acclimates it stops that you know

1333
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:17,579
but like it took a while to learn that

1334
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,199
stuff you know yeah and the time we're

1335
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:21,660
cutting is one of those strains that uh

1336
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:24,719
would never do get indoors very very

1337
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:26,519
stringy the uh the branches could not

1338
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,480
hold up The Vibes

1339
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:29,639
um

1340
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,400
and it's meant for it was bred Outdoors

1341
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:34,558
it's meant indoors it just did not yeah

1342
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,300
it was not impressive at all indoors

1343
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,400
yeah some plants just don't translate

1344
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,079
it's it's really weird I know not so has

1345
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,318
a lot of experience with that too you

1346
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:45,420
know indoor to outdoor strains yeah I

1347
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:48,659
mean I definitely have seen a lot of

1348
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:51,659
very stable stuff outside that panics

1349
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:53,338
and Herms when you bring it inside yeah

1350
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:55,379
um I've done a bunch of experimenting

1351
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:58,139
and side by sides because I've grown a

1352
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:01,079
lot of the same strains for a long time

1353
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:02,759
uh I think that plants use different

1354
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,099
spectrums of light for different

1355
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,740
processes and when you put them outside

1356
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:09,539
in the sun they just get like the whole

1357
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:11,279
Cornucopia of anything they could want

1358
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:13,318
from light is right there for them to

1359
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,660
pull and if you look at the spectral

1360
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:18,179
charts of any kind of lamp you might use

1361
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:20,578
indoors they're very very narrow

1362
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:23,219
compared to the Sun

1363
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:26,220
and so I tend to believe that there are

1364
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:27,539
certain things that like the sun

1365
00:52:26,219 --> 00:52:30,118
you know

1366
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:31,858
um you know and and you just don't get

1367
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,858
unless you blend a bunch of different

1368
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:36,480
types of Lights in the same indoor

1369
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:38,578
um you just don't you just it's really

1370
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,800
hard to approximate that and some plants

1371
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:43,920
are super sensitive to light

1372
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,539
uh and you know and UV and and all that

1373
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,639
different types of stuff and so I can't

1374
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:49,558
say it for certain

1375
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:53,058
um but you know I would agree with that

1376
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:53,059
I would definitely agree with that

1377
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:57,659
you know I mean I I have plants that are

1378
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,118
very old now and I think sometimes

1379
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:02,159
they're very finicky inside and I can

1380
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:05,099
struggle with them a little bit but if I

1381
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,379
put them in a greenhouse they're a champ

1382
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:11,338
every time without fail they just rock

1383
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:13,500
that's how the time work was yeah

1384
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:17,779
and I just distribute that to like you

1385
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,780
know the sun is about is the best light

1386
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,659
so definitely

1387
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,338
it's interesting in that regard what

1388
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:28,139
about Pine berries

1389
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:31,259
primary um

1390
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:33,598
very nice strain um

1391
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:36,960
I'd much um it was it was about very

1392
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,760
popular straight outdoors in Canada uh

1393
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,460
back in the day and I bet a lot of that

1394
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,680
got sold down south as beasters

1395
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:47,039
um I'm sure but it was the beautiful

1396
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:50,219
little like golf golf ball sized buds uh

1397
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:53,940
and just prolific easy to trim very very

1398
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:55,858
branchy uh it would usually finish I

1399
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,559
always harvest the planting stages when

1400
00:53:55,858 --> 00:54:00,179
we get fields of It Outdoors you'd go uh

1401
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,700
probably the first or probably the

1402
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:05,940
second week of September you'd go cut

1403
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:07,318
all the tops the top foot top colas and

1404
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,179
then you'd wait another two weeks and

1405
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:10,920
then the bottoms were just Affiliated to

1406
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,358
get big and you can do that almost three

1407
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,180
harvests off the same plant and just

1408
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:17,219
work your way down as as it thickened up

1409
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:19,139
that's awesome it was another one that

1410
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:21,838
was very mold resistant you could put in

1411
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:24,179
in the rain and it can take it

1412
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:26,639
and uh I know a lot of guys sold it as

1413
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:29,098
indoors it looks so nice in a bag people

1414
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,318
would pass it off as indoors when oh

1415
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:34,200
yeah and you knew you go oh that's

1416
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:35,759
obviously outdoor or Greenhouse but you

1417
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:38,578
know a lot of the part of the public

1418
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,920
didn't know that so it was nice enough

1419
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,660
to fly under the radar yeah that's very

1420
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,380
common I mean especially the first

1421
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:48,480
second and third Cut Thing uh for even

1422
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:51,059
my area outdoor Growers and stuff that

1423
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,699
had limited dry space something that you

1424
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:55,859
could cut in waves and you could fill

1425
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:57,598
your drawing room and then by the time

1426
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:59,519
you were empty it you could take another

1427
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,500
round and then by the time you emptied

1428
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:03,719
it you could take the third round that

1429
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,940
was very beneficial

1430
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:08,039
um because space was a premium and you

1431
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:12,119
could you could much easier grow more

1432
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:15,000
than you could process most most

1433
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,559
definitely for us to uh you know the

1434
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,960
whole month of September and halfway

1435
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,240
into October was basically a month and a

1436
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,679
half of harvest every two days you'd go

1437
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:25,618
out to the bush

1438
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:28,739
you harvest what you can you watch for

1439
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:30,660
any problems and if it's still sunny out

1440
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,618
you leave what you can and then it was

1441
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:37,858
every second day you do the truck drive

1442
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:40,858
and yeah it was uh a lot of that too you

1443
00:55:37,858 --> 00:55:42,299
hang up the pine Berry and then get it

1444
00:55:40,858 --> 00:55:43,558
down for a week it's dry enough you got

1445
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,839
to fill up the room and then we just

1446
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,480
pack it away in a room to trim later

1447
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,460
because you rarely had enough time to uh

1448
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,679
to trim it as it came in

1449
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:55,280
so I'm sure

1450
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:58,318
I I missed those old days

1451
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,059
yeah I do too to be honest with you my

1452
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:02,519
old days are different than your old

1453
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:05,220
days obviously I'm like the generation

1454
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:08,099
under but even then still like the the

1455
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:10,558
for Californians like the Heyday prop

1456
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,180
215 was was like

1457
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,800
you know we had a pretty good I think

1458
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:16,019
better than we had it for a long time

1459
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,480
for a lot of people you know the reason

1460
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:20,940
why indoor is King is you are able to

1461
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,240
grow indoor in more places than you were

1462
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:26,220
able to grow outdoor both from like a a

1463
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:28,259
place where outdoor was you know would

1464
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:30,838
do well and you could get away with it

1465
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,760
and and not get in big trouble you know

1466
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:35,159
indoor you could have a garage or a

1467
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:38,220
bedroom or a warehouse and it was safe

1468
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:40,318
from prying eyes outdoor yeah you kind

1469
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:42,358
of had to be somewhere semi-permissible

1470
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,219
or at least where the cat and mouse game

1471
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:47,880
could get played yeah

1472
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:49,318
um yeah so very rural very rural uh

1473
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,818
places you have to be you have to be an

1474
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:54,420
Outdoorsman

1475
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:56,279
up here in Canada to do it so

1476
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,400
what do you know about the Ortega clone

1477
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,780
that went around Canada anything

1478
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,119
um actually I've never worked with that

1479
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,099
one I can't really tell you much to info

1480
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,358
on that one yeah I wasn't sure that

1481
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:07,260
that's just one of those ones that I

1482
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:09,058
hear about

1483
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,339
um there's an Iranian that went around

1484
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:13,680
in Canada I think

1485
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:16,279
Auto yeah I believe that's that's more

1486
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:19,500
in Eastern Canada

1487
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:22,980
Quebec just like the M39 those trades

1488
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:24,480
more of a Quebec thing gotcha uh Pink

1489
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,579
Kush

1490
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,619
did you purchase

1491
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:30,900
I've never worked with that one

1492
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:34,079
um reefer man would be the professional

1493
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:36,119
on that one yeah you did a lot of work

1494
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,339
with it so I've never I never really

1495
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:41,519
worked with it myself

1496
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:44,639
okay my next list goes on into the Next

1497
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,960
Generation era the most important era

1498
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:47,519
for your would you say it's the most

1499
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,199
important arrow for your your work and

1500
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,318
the stuff you're most proud of

1501
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:55,279
oh yes um Federation was just my first

1502
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:55,279
year and a half in the business

1503
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:00,959
almost 26 years now doing next

1504
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:04,079
generation

1505
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,358
so yeah that's even to this day I I have

1506
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,680
a lot of the old strains I picked up I

1507
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:09,358
still stayed with a lot of my old

1508
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,639
strains I keep trying to perfect them

1509
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:13,679
start bringing on everything new yes

1510
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:16,618
that you know the popular strain of the

1511
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,719
year I admire that a lot and that's it

1512
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,480
really impresses me I'm not really

1513
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,539
interested in other breeders work

1514
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,539
yeah

1515
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,579
and keep working on my own stuff making

1516
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,760
it better so I mean in the American

1517
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:36,200
market today uh people that do that are

1518
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:40,260
probably like two percent yeah like 98

1519
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:42,480
is probably one-off hybrids that they

1520
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:45,780
make and then they sell and then they

1521
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:49,798
move on and each drop that they do is a

1522
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:51,960
unique you know breeding or reversals or

1523
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:54,659
whatever the first time working with any

1524
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,818
of these moms yeah and it's very rare to

1525
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:58,558
have people that just like these are my

1526
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:00,719
favorites this is what I like these are

1527
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,240
the traits I'm looking for and I'm gonna

1528
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:04,379
keep working these lines towards what I

1529
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,539
enjoy

1530
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:08,760
yeah that's that's exactly how I do a

1531
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:09,960
lot of my varieties it's just once I

1532
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,380
know what I'm looking for I'm just

1533
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,838
trying to stabilize certain traits

1534
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:18,119
with a lot of the varieties so yeah and

1535
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:21,119
I a lot of people keep offering me and I

1536
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,400
do obviously do do uh some one-off

1537
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,500
coupons and cutting some other varieties

1538
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,280
so right now I have a really nice Larry

1539
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:31,920
OG I've got sure my death Bubba and a

1540
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,798
few other strains and I just I bring

1541
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,599
into it and do make some one-off crosses

1542
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:39,239
but they're not the they're not the

1543
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:41,700
strains like I treat like my children

1544
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:43,439
um the other there's part of my catalog

1545
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:46,379
that you know been a part of my life for

1546
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,240
25 years so I can I can tell you exactly

1547
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,720
how they do in different climates and

1548
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:53,279
what to feed them what not to feed them

1549
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:56,338
and uh

1550
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:59,298
so but yeah

1551
00:59:56,338 --> 00:59:59,298
I'm sorry good

1552
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,039
um I was going to ask you have you seen

1553
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,119
the pink Death Star up there by any

1554
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:07,019
chance

1555
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:10,200
pink death star Pink Death Star

1556
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:11,759
no I can't say I have yeah it's one it's

1557
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:13,858
one that keeps going around up there and

1558
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,480
I've wanted someone that has interaction

1559
01:00:13,858 --> 01:00:17,578
with it to describe it to me I've almost

1560
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,818
had people get it over here but never

1561
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:22,559
makes it yeah it's just one that I can

1562
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:24,779
talk about well I know more stuff about

1563
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,420
the genetics and what happened on back

1564
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:32,280
in the old days in the late 90s to 2000s

1565
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:35,119
because I left Canada in 2008. okay and

1566
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:40,079
I moved back only in

1567
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:42,000
2017. oh wow almost a 10-year Gap where

1568
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,798
I don't really like kind of out of touch

1569
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,199
with what happened during that 10 years

1570
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:47,519
sure when I came back here five years

1571
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:48,358
ago

1572
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,818
um

1573
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:53,578
I kind of just get set up my warehouse

1574
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:55,920
and I started doing my own uh my own

1575
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:57,660
varieties again and I mixed less with

1576
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,059
what's going on in the in the local

1577
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:02,519
community than I than I used to

1578
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:03,720
where did you go during those years and

1579
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:04,619
were you still breeding and selling

1580
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:08,039
seeds

1581
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:10,579
oh yes I was reading in Spanish oh yeah

1582
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:13,558
I was making a lot of seeds in Spain

1583
01:01:10,579 --> 01:01:15,539
Amsterdam for six months that was too

1584
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:19,680
expensive to live there so I moved down

1585
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:22,139
to Spain and yeah had a few different uh

1586
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:24,838
breeding operations down there and I

1587
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:27,358
produced a lot of seeds for uh a lot of

1588
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:29,699
Moroccan farmers and I actually forgot

1589
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,739
Farmers as well there's a lot of the

1590
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:34,259
Dutch guys uh

1591
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:37,399
they would Farm out their seed making to

1592
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,780
a Spanish first so yeah yeah

1593
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,940
the influencia profits and the loan

1594
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,920
where I lived I know a bunch of the big

1595
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:46,500
seed producers uh they're all personal

1596
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,338
friends of mine that produce for sweet

1597
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,960
seeds pyramid seeds uh for green every

1598
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:54,779
other street over there it comes from

1599
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,699
the same farmers and the Dutch Dutch

1600
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,559
Growers too it was too expensive to grow

1601
01:01:56,699 --> 01:02:00,419
up so they would just come meet a

1602
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,420
Spanish guy or somebody like me living

1603
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,099
in Spain and uh needs for them they

1604
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,318
bring us yeah they bring us the cones

1605
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:08,880
and say okay here you go we'll buy them

1606
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:11,519
off you for a bucket seat

1607
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,660
uh just make them for us so a lot of the

1608
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,579
Dutch companies don't even make their

1609
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:17,338
own stuff anymore oh yeah that's been

1610
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:20,579
going on for a long time too since 2000

1611
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:23,039
really yeah I mean I believe in 99 or

1612
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:25,318
2000 they change the law in Amsterdam

1613
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,298
there was a loophole or in in the

1614
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:29,400
Netherlands I should say where you could

1615
01:02:27,298 --> 01:02:31,199
grow legally cannabis seeds and they

1616
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,818
couldn't mess with you

1617
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:35,399
um and I think they closed that loophole

1618
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:37,380
and then a bunch of the famous seed

1619
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,780
companies got raided or busted or

1620
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:43,140
whatever and I think that was one of the

1621
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:46,200
big reasons that the exit has happened

1622
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:49,019
um and it also secretly seems to be when

1623
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:51,419
they started farming out the actual seed

1624
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:53,639
production to third parties and not

1625
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:55,980
doing it in-house anymore but just not

1626
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:57,420
mentioning that it was all third parties

1627
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,699
producing their seat

1628
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:01,559
yeah and a lot of the Dutch guys you

1629
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:03,118
know you're living in Holland uh

1630
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:04,380
wouldn't you rather live in Spain where

1631
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,200
it's nice and sunny

1632
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:10,079
uh all year round so a lot of them are

1633
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:11,460
hired to to Spain so a lot of them did

1634
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,599
bring the genetics down there and they

1635
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,798
have their network of friends and

1636
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:15,298
Growers

1637
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:17,579
and you know a couple buddies it seems

1638
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:20,039
like Spain and Switzerland

1639
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:21,660
first you know reader reader Steve went

1640
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:23,460
to Switzerland shauncey went to

1641
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:26,699
Switzerland some other people went Swiss

1642
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:28,740
for a bit was there Scott was there yep

1643
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:30,779
yep all that and then some people went

1644
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:34,500
to Spain and vice versa and that kind of

1645
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:37,200
became like the new places in Europe

1646
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:39,358
um one thing this is totally random but

1647
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:41,159
I don't want to lose it before before we

1648
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,900
do is that

1649
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:45,239
um maybe you could talk for a second

1650
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,280
when you were in Spain about like how

1651
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:50,578
much Moroccan do you think is still

1652
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:54,298
actual land race Moroccan and how much

1653
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:56,880
is imported Spanish work grown in

1654
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:58,920
Morocco so yeah actually I know quite a

1655
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,480
bit about that because I went to Morocco

1656
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,579
several times quite quite a few times

1657
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,159
with a lot of big uh I had some Spanish

1658
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:07,079
friends that were big house Smugglers

1659
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:09,659
and some of them with it had Grow shops

1660
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:13,260
and they were seed breeders in Spain I

1661
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:15,659
would go Supply Spain or Supply Morocco

1662
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,160
with seeds but uh when the first time I

1663
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:20,699
went there to meet some of the farmers

1664
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:22,078
in the mountains and in ketama uh I went

1665
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:26,219
there looking for that old school

1666
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:27,440
Moroccan sure uh the real Brown the

1667
01:04:26,219 --> 01:04:30,179
stuff they made

1668
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,500
yeah they made the key for it but by the

1669
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:36,480
time I went there it would have been

1670
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:38,880
around 2009 2010 they had our at that

1671
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,980
period they had already switched over to

1672
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,440
mostly Pakistani genetics

1673
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,119
interesting there were very few Farmers

1674
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,420
that were still doing the old school

1675
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:51,599
Moroccan uh strains that had that nice

1676
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:53,400
Dusty flavor more like the kind of more

1677
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,220
resembled a lot of the Lebanese stuff

1678
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,440
actually yeah think about it and uh but

1679
01:04:56,219 --> 01:05:01,019
a lot redder hash like the pakistanis

1680
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,240
would yield double or triple

1681
01:05:01,019 --> 01:05:05,039
and so

1682
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:06,899
but they uh at that point they still

1683
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:10,699
weren't cutting the males they were just

1684
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:13,500
starting to learn to go out oh wow

1685
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:16,019
and and if you did if you were a grower

1686
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,639
who did it cut all your mails well your

1687
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:20,338
neighbor's mail Paul is still going to

1688
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:22,920
fold in yeah but but even with a bit of

1689
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:24,719
that floating in you're gonna it's gonna

1690
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,639
be substantially less yeah

1691
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:27,419
yeah when we went started going down

1692
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,298
there

1693
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:32,039
to Morocco a lot of the big guys that

1694
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:34,199
were the big sellers in the region for

1695
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:37,259
the local hush farmers were starting to

1696
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:41,399
clue in that if we started

1697
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:43,260
bringing buying the Spanish femini seeds

1698
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,700
um they would up their heels they

1699
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,440
wouldn't have all these males and they

1700
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:49,019
would get a lot more hash so they

1701
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,480
started a reporting a lot of from Spain

1702
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:55,259
a lot of the super silver haze and

1703
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:57,480
critical uh plus so

1704
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,280
so many of the farmers there started

1705
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,280
switching to buying feminized seeds and

1706
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,260
a lot of the US farmers in Spain when we

1707
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,500
had extra seeds we knew that every year

1708
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:09,480
the Moroccan buyers would be up in Spain

1709
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,519
and they would buy seeds by the million

1710
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,679
yeah and then they would distribute it

1711
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:16,739
to their farmers and stop the quality

1712
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:19,259
and yields uh so yeah they switched I

1713
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:21,019
would say with the last five years it's

1714
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,339
mostly Spanish

1715
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:25,318
varieties well which is based on Dutch

1716
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:27,779
stuff we wanted the critical and soap

1717
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:30,058
case and uh and I've actually been

1718
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:33,059
running quite a bit of contact lately in

1719
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:36,240
the last two years with a big rock and

1720
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:38,460
uh guy down there and they're really

1721
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,959
looking to develop strains now that are

1722
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,179
more drought resistant

1723
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,579
there's a lot of interesting a lot of

1724
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:46,739
the varieties from Spain were not draw

1725
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:49,318
resistant they used so much more water

1726
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:51,179
yeah and uh so a lot of the farmers

1727
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:53,038
there now are putting in drip lines even

1728
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:55,500
back when I was there the farm that we

1729
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:59,160
went to they already had to drip lines

1730
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:01,858
my Spanish friend who uh was the buyer

1731
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:04,558
of all their hash he brought down it two

1732
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:07,078
Vans full of drip lines uh to this farm

1733
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,220
for these guys and they were doing a

1734
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:10,260
really good job

1735
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:12,239
of it yeah

1736
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:14,520
but yeah they're really the guy that I'm

1737
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:15,899
talking to now uh he's on the other side

1738
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:17,400
of the mountain he's not up in the

1739
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,559
mountains in katama he's down in he's

1740
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,059
got a research place about 10 acres and

1741
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:24,359
they're trying to develop the drought

1742
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:26,339
resistant varieties oh wow I've been

1743
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:27,719
talking to him about it and he's asking

1744
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:29,099
me which varieties of mine are the most

1745
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:31,259
drought resistant so they're going to be

1746
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:34,619
working with some of my varieties doing

1747
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:37,380
some selective reading down in this area

1748
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,420
it makes sense they go from very drought

1749
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:41,818
resistant varieties that probably were

1750
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:44,760
low lower yielding because they're

1751
01:07:41,818 --> 01:07:46,199
because they could survive in an arid

1752
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,480
climate and they weren't really getting

1753
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:51,899
as much inputs as they needed but they

1754
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,719
would live to these bigger yielding uh

1755
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,519
Dutch things that drought resistance

1756
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,679
isn't a problem when you're in Holland

1757
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:00,179
indoor and you're just getting fed with

1758
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:01,679
Rockwell all the time so they weren't

1759
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:03,179
breeding for that and so they get these

1760
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,379
bigger yielding plants but they're

1761
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,940
thirsty

1762
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,980
and then they realize they don't have

1763
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:10,440
enough water

1764
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:11,519
you know that's an interesting education

1765
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,460
area

1766
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,920
I never did find find any of the

1767
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:18,719
original Moroccan uh I had the

1768
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,759
the guys that I knew there I'd ask them

1769
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,859
about is there any Farmers still growing

1770
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:24,060
this original variety and I had them

1771
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:27,179
looking for me because I wanted to get

1772
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:29,880
my hands on the seed sure um and I had

1773
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:32,159
any luck what's a shame about that is

1774
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,659
you would think that the critical plus

1775
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,939
you were talking about and the super

1776
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:37,619
silver haze and some of that those

1777
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:39,778
obviously like some of that original

1778
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:42,719
Moroccan would be prime breeding

1779
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:45,120
candidates to try to mix into those

1780
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:48,600
lines and to find ones that are drought

1781
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:50,460
resistant and acclimated but yield more

1782
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,199
yeah that's that's definitely right

1783
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:55,500
that'd be the way to do it

1784
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:57,000
yeah too bad you know I didn't mention

1785
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,819
it but like when you were talking about

1786
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,698
uh reeferment being down in Jamaica

1787
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:04,500
Jamaica has a similar thing in that most

1788
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:05,879
of the original Jamaican lines are

1789
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,100
basically it seems like almost

1790
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:11,640
completely gone and they've been

1791
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,440
replaced by Dutch genetics

1792
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,480
um that were shorter and faster and

1793
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:18,238
bigger yielding and easier and maybe

1794
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:20,218
better names for them

1795
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:22,500
um and so it's it's you know it's the

1796
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:24,359
way nature works or whatever but you

1797
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,679
know a lot of these land races have been

1798
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:27,480
displaced

1799
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,359
well that's one thing that I know reefer

1800
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:32,399
man is doing right now in Jamaica with

1801
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:33,838
the plot of land that he's working on

1802
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,759
he's trying to bring back a lot of those

1803
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,259
old varieties because he has pretty

1804
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,819
extensive collection and I know he's

1805
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:42,359
been working on bringing back the old

1806
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:44,100
Jamaican lands breath with uh his uh

1807
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,620
Rastafarian Collective there I believe

1808
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,060
he's working with

1809
01:09:45,619 --> 01:09:50,698
trying to bring back the old one so if

1810
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:52,859
anyone can do it he can do it

1811
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:54,779
I've I've often thought too that like

1812
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:57,420
some of the places like in Afghanistan

1813
01:09:54,779 --> 01:10:00,479
and Pakistan that have so many of their

1814
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:03,179
original varieties it's probably because

1815
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:05,099
it's been at War for 25 years and it's

1816
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:08,159
been pretty dangerous for westerners

1817
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,719
especially you know white Christians or

1818
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,159
something like that to go into those

1819
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:12,779
Hills

1820
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:15,359
um and so as a result of that they

1821
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:17,460
really haven't gotten Super Silver Haze

1822
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:19,559
or critical mass or this or that or

1823
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:20,640
Dutch hybrids because it's not easy to

1824
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,280
go there

1825
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,380
you know yeah that's not it's bad you

1826
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:27,719
know definitely a little more secluded

1827
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:29,960
those genetics haven't been polluted yet

1828
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:29,960
so

1829
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:34,198
interesting maybe someday I'll have to

1830
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:36,060
grow a grow a beard and go there oh all

1831
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:38,339
right

1832
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:42,260
yeah I know we can go I'll grow a beer

1833
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:42,260
and go they're all incognito

1834
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,340
um so let's talk about let's see Diablo

1835
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:49,799
that's that's a real popular next

1836
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:51,719
generation one that I remember yeah it

1837
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,940
was very uh popular

1838
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:56,460
um that's another one I've lost but that

1839
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:59,479
was basically my Avalon uh across with

1840
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:02,279
that early sativa as well

1841
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:04,439
yeah very cool

1842
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:09,000
yeah I know there's a lot of growers in

1843
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:11,759
the Midwest in Minnesota Michigan uh you

1844
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,738
know across Nebraska Kentucky back in

1845
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,600
those days I just loved and raved that

1846
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:17,399
bucket Diablo because it was one of the

1847
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,219
strains uh when it was in veg it grew

1848
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:22,559
like a sativa and extremely fast but the

1849
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:25,319
second it tripped into flower

1850
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,120
um it would flower fast uh whether it

1851
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:29,399
was indoors or Outdoors indoors it was

1852
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,859
about a six flowering period but it

1853
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:35,119
didn't give the Quality quality buds

1854
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:37,619
indoors Outdoors it was just amazing so

1855
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:39,238
in a shorter climate you could you could

1856
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:41,599
veg you can get a large size plant and

1857
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:44,279
when it flipped it flipped hard and fast

1858
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,679
that was one of uh yeah it was very nice

1859
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:47,519
trade our buddy rings that was his

1860
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:49,319
favorite

1861
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,440
he has a bunch of pictures of it just

1862
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:55,198
Mass just like 14 foot plants out in

1863
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:57,238
Mendo wow yeah

1864
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:59,639
um your Afghani Kush

1865
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:02,459
which hash plant did you use in that

1866
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:07,380
uh The Afghani Kush it was an Afghani

1867
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:09,420
hash plant uh in BC back in the day that

1868
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:12,420
was one of the first ones that I used to

1869
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:15,000
read my Avalon strain with but it was

1870
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,899
Danny hashback crossed with the BC Kush

1871
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,020
actually

1872
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:21,179
okay my uh first uh thing that I strain

1873
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:24,900
that I referred to as the Afghani kush

1874
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:26,340
yeah so that's those are that's the

1875
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:28,738
parentage there

1876
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:30,179
okay uh grapefruit Haze we talked about

1877
01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:31,859
this earlier it was going around San

1878
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,760
Diego for a while

1879
01:12:31,859 --> 01:12:34,139
yeah

1880
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,900
um that's like you said the original

1881
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:38,400
grapefruit uh Pink Grapefruit Mercado

1882
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:40,139
Dynamite whatever you want to call it

1883
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:45,238
yeah uh with like you're saying the

1884
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:47,039
Flying Dutchman uh skunk one by Haze

1885
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:48,899
very nice

1886
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:49,859
I've been working with that ever ever

1887
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:51,899
since

1888
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:54,299
um it's now basically is that inbred

1889
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:57,420
line but it was the very it was the

1890
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,980
first first variety that I turned into a

1891
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,980
into an Autoflower

1892
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:03,899
oh wow doing that as an Autoflower very

1893
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:06,238
very long time now since I've been in

1894
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:09,299
Spain about 10 years and it's the one

1895
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:12,059
that has uh great mold resistance

1896
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:13,560
everybody that grows it here in Canada

1897
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,000
has

1898
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,120
when it's side by side with another

1899
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:22,020
Autoflower it may not be

1900
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:23,880
as a larger plant uh but it is stinky

1901
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:26,699
and it's no mold

1902
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:30,000
very very cold resistant so

1903
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:31,500
what did you use to um to to make your

1904
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,359
plants Autoflower what was your

1905
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,658
Autoflower input

1906
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:38,579
it was uh the very first

1907
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:40,198
Rooter Alice Cross I used was of uh

1908
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:43,260
ruderalis big bud

1909
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:45,000
okay that was going around from a grower

1910
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:46,260
friend in Spain who worked a few other

1911
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,658
seed companies

1912
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:51,000
uh and that's what I did my first uh

1913
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:54,658
back cross with it was already

1914
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,880
uh it was already a semi-stabilized uh

1915
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:59,099
looter Alice big bud it was already

1916
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,980
being sold as an Autoflower so that's

1917
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:04,199
what I used as my first back cross

1918
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:07,678
and then yeah once I had four back

1919
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:09,479
crosses into it it was it was stable

1920
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,880
it was more more stable

1921
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:14,099
yeah on a few Generations into it now

1922
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,719
like I did a lot of a lot more selecting

1923
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,039
since I've been back in Canada as well

1924
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:19,140
so

1925
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:22,319
that's cool yeah I've done very little

1926
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:24,780
Autoflower work but I did some with uh

1927
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:27,479
Ernesto from Buddha seeds Spain

1928
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:29,759
um his his uh white dwarf they were they

1929
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:31,819
were dwarf autos auto dwarfs I think he

1930
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,679
called them okay

1931
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:37,259
I had a good friend in Spain that made a

1932
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:38,539
bunch of the red dwarfs white drawers

1933
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,739
yeah yes

1934
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:42,238
a few of those they couldn't even be my

1935
01:14:40,738 --> 01:14:43,738
buddy's Dro that's what they came from

1936
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:45,178
yeah

1937
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:49,859
Ernesto right

1938
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:51,239
uh I think he owned uh yeah yeah

1939
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:55,319
it's like most people over there they

1940
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:57,718
buy their seats yeah yeah exactly yeah

1941
01:14:55,319 --> 01:15:01,198
you know this is a little off topic but

1942
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:04,380
maybe not when uh since you decided to

1943
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:07,198
go and move to Europe for 10 years was

1944
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:08,880
it personal reasons was it weather was

1945
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,099
it like you felt like it was a business

1946
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,679
opportunity over there for seed making

1947
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:17,280
was it a combo

1948
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:19,739
there's a combo of reasons um I I've

1949
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,599
always wanted to travel Europe and and

1950
01:15:19,738 --> 01:15:23,339
do what back in the day if you wanted to

1951
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,039
reach the big leagues in the seed

1952
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:29,819
business you had to move to Europe yeah

1953
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:31,619
so and that mixed with uh the week that

1954
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:33,359
I moved there was also the week Mark

1955
01:15:31,619 --> 01:15:35,819
Emery got sentenced to five years in

1956
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:40,079
prison for selling seeds oh that's a

1957
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:43,920
good time and I was I was uh to say they

1958
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,899
were looking at me pretty heavy I bet I

1959
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,539
just felt it was time to go and leave

1960
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:49,738
for a while yeah before I end up in the

1961
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:51,679
can as well

1962
01:15:49,738 --> 01:15:53,879
before you end up yeah

1963
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,560
I was more in the background but I was

1964
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,960
one of the largest seed producers that

1965
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,659
that he had yeah so I figured wow it's

1966
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,158
the perfect time to leave uh better get

1967
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:05,279
out while you're ahead

1968
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:07,679
yeah so that that's what I did and uh

1969
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:10,219
anyway did you enjoy laying there

1970
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,219
I

1971
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:20,340
almost consider spraying my home uh

1972
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:21,899
living there for nine years when I

1973
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,920
travel to Spain it feels like I'm going

1974
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:25,379
home

1975
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,179
yeah did you did you speak Spanish

1976
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,619
before you moved there did you learn

1977
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:31,380
while you were there

1978
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:33,559
I learned a fair amount of Spanish when

1979
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:37,140
I was there yeah yeah

1980
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:38,580
it's pretty fluent now so is it fairly

1981
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:42,239
affordable compared to like California

1982
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:44,039
that you know very affordable very uh

1983
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:45,718
blind space in Spain if you're living in

1984
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:46,979
the north of Europe it's very expensive

1985
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:49,039
yeah

1986
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:49,039
um

1987
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,139
in Canadian or American dollars I

1988
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,840
probably paid about 2 500 for a small

1989
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:00,119
apartment with a little Garage in the

1990
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,579
back in in Amsterdam

1991
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:04,559
so uh when I got offered the opportunity

1992
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:08,698
to move to Spain

1993
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:12,480
um my rent went down to about 400 and uh

1994
01:17:08,698 --> 01:17:16,158
and I had a three-story 14 room hotel

1995
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:20,519
that was that I lived in for 450

1996
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:22,859
so and the cost of living is next to

1997
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:26,120
nothing in Spain oh my God in comparison

1998
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:26,119
to uh yeah yeah

1999
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:35,340
the food is cheap and great uh

2000
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,560
nice and polite there yeah the culture's

2001
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:40,159
pretty polite yeah very very different

2002
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:42,239
from what I'm used to I mean the the the

2003
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:44,039
culture one of the things I think is

2004
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:45,599
cool about the culture especially for

2005
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:49,560
people that do a lot of indoor gardening

2006
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:51,239
like we all do is uh they stay up late

2007
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:53,880
um you know it gets it gets hot there

2008
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:55,559
and so it's very common you know you'll

2009
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,000
have you'll have playgrounds full of

2010
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,679
kids at 10 o'clock at night because

2011
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,460
that's when it cools down that's normal

2012
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:04,739
that's totally normal you know eating it

2013
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:06,179
eating at 9 45 at night because that's

2014
01:18:04,738 --> 01:18:08,698
when it's cooled down and you start

2015
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:09,658
cooking you know late does it get that

2016
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:13,439
hot there

2017
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:16,319
it gets very hot

2018
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,479
like no yeah I love that I I was always

2019
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,158
being in Canada when I lived in the

2020
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:22,079
cities I do my watering usually at night

2021
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:23,639
I go out and start working in the grow

2022
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:24,658
room at 10 pm because you knew the

2023
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:27,480
neighbors weren't going to come over

2024
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:29,759
things like that so you go out to the

2025
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:31,799
girl room at 10 p.m you work till two or

2026
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,079
three in the morning

2027
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,239
um and that was kind of my cycle so when

2028
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:38,219
I moved to Spain it fitted perfectly

2029
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:39,899
yeah that's what I was just thinking I

2030
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:42,359
was like man it really is well suited

2031
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:44,579
for indoor gardeners because it's got

2032
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:46,738
that late night lifestyle like Matt you

2033
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:49,140
trip out you can literally be at a

2034
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:51,539
playground at 11 o'clock at night and it

2035
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:54,060
is full of screaming eight-year-olds and

2036
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:56,640
running around parents hanging out the

2037
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:58,739
swings are full people are like it's so

2038
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:01,260
weird like

2039
01:18:58,738 --> 01:19:03,718
yeah they just they right

2040
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:05,159
yeah a lot of the LGBT people don't go

2041
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:07,859
out during the day because it's too hot

2042
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:09,839
that's not too far it makes sense at 10

2043
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:11,279
p.m you'll see all the old ladies on the

2044
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,659
street with their canes walking up and

2045
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,539
down the street till two in the morning

2046
01:19:12,658 --> 01:19:18,059
that's awesome during the summer months

2047
01:19:15,539 --> 01:19:20,519
oh it's great it was very I enjoyed

2048
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:24,560
living there and uh I'm still

2049
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:24,560
considering retiring there once I'm

2050
01:19:26,539 --> 01:19:32,880
on a personal note my dad wanted to move

2051
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:34,319
the family to Spain in like the 90s

2052
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,779
um because he had a bunch of work in

2053
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:38,099
Europe and it was so much closer my mom

2054
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:40,019
wouldn't do it because she didn't want

2055
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:41,460
to learn another language but he was

2056
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:43,620
basically like if we would have moved

2057
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:45,600
there then with the exchange rate what

2058
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:47,340
it was and how cheap real estate was

2059
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,219
he's like I probably would have retired

2060
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:52,260
15 years before I did just because of

2061
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:54,179
the way it all worked out

2062
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:56,340
um you know it was so affordable I think

2063
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:59,039
it's changed a little bit but it used to

2064
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:00,960
be incredibly cheap

2065
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:04,738
you know it still is compared to Canada

2066
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:07,198
uh in the U.S uh it's still very cheap

2067
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:09,059
very very cheap so

2068
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:11,039
yeah I can never afford to buy a nice

2069
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:12,900
house here in Canada again but down

2070
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:15,119
there no problem

2071
01:20:12,899 --> 01:20:17,819
yeah same in California it's crazy now

2072
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,979
it is crazy like where I live in

2073
01:20:17,819 --> 01:20:22,079
California Bakersfield it used to be

2074
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:24,000
like one of the last little bastions of

2075
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:26,238
affordable living in California you know

2076
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,158
where you could get a house for 250 000

2077
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:31,139
you can't get a tiny house now like a

2078
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:34,339
1200 square foot house or less than half

2079
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:37,980
a million it's it's over you know like

2080
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:39,779
in Spain yeah for 250 000 in Spain you

2081
01:20:37,979 --> 01:20:41,639
have a beautiful house with a swimming

2082
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:45,599
pool and a nice view

2083
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:47,520
yeah crazy yeah I mean Matt doesn't even

2084
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,620
live in a nut I mean he technically

2085
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,140
lives in California but like

2086
01:20:49,619 --> 01:20:53,519
it's not technically yeah no I just met

2087
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,600
the reason why I said technically is

2088
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,000
because when people think of California

2089
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:59,520
they think Coastal and woods or

2090
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,479
mountains I live in hell he just lives

2091
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:05,820
in in boiling hot desert dry nasty and

2092
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:08,819
it's still affordable it is still an

2093
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:11,039
affordable now yeah it's crazy

2094
01:21:08,819 --> 01:21:12,299
so what what are some of the ones you

2095
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:14,340
want to cover the most from Next

2096
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,079
Generation that that our current stock

2097
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:19,140
that you want people to know about the

2098
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:22,559
most well well we brought our Romulan uh

2099
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:24,840
back femini yes awesome yeah it's uh

2100
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,880
yeah it's as close as I can get to the

2101
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,079
original except that it produces better

2102
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,239
than the original

2103
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,880
uh produces much better than the

2104
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:35,579
original that's a big good trait for it

2105
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,940
yeah yeah I can't say it's not quite as

2106
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:40,859
Piney as yeah as the old one was but

2107
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:42,238
it's it's pretty damn close

2108
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:43,859
so

2109
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:46,319
yeah is that the dominant terpene

2110
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:48,079
profile for um Romulan was Pine yeah

2111
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:50,698
very Pine okay

2112
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:52,260
gotcha just get really the dominant one

2113
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:53,879
definitely

2114
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:56,520
so

2115
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:59,460
so yeah um and I don't know if you've

2116
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:02,460
seen my catalog or a peruse the uh the

2117
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:03,719
website a little bit but I've got a few

2118
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,880
new varieties

2119
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:07,920
um I'm bringing back uh old Colombian

2120
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,920
red Mexican variety

2121
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,920
uh

2122
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:20,279
around the 12

2123
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,279
weeks

2124
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:25,500
around 12 weeks though so awesome and a

2125
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:28,619
lot of people that scares off but not me

2126
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:31,619
no even if it was longer I'd rather have

2127
01:22:28,619 --> 01:22:32,939
a a nice pure trustworthy Colombian red

2128
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:35,219
light or something didn't worry about

2129
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:37,379
how long it flowers I've also got a

2130
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:40,039
tester room I last year I made a bunch

2131
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:44,940
of uh I crossed my Romulan with a few uh

2132
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:48,658
uh Malawi gold uh land race oh nice and

2133
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:50,460
also with the Rojo Colombian and also

2134
01:22:48,658 --> 01:22:53,099
with the Acapulco Gold

2135
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:55,439
so I've got a a nice room right now with

2136
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:57,719
about five weeks into flower right now

2137
01:22:55,439 --> 01:23:00,359
I'm doing a big uh grow out and testing

2138
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:02,819
them out but the Malawi's the first

2139
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:06,839
round they were so wild and so sativa

2140
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:08,460
and I didn't find I wasn't quite uh

2141
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,440
very impressed with it but I did a few

2142
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:13,800
crosses anyway with a few of the nicest

2143
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:15,799
cats and the romulent crops that I've

2144
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:18,900
done with it are just coming along

2145
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:21,300
phenomenally right now

2146
01:23:18,899 --> 01:23:22,799
and it struck me so much and made it

2147
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,219
Global indoors because they were just

2148
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:28,980
they were so lanky uh in the first round

2149
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:30,359
that I did so yeah if I do release that

2150
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:32,158
that's that's probably still going to be

2151
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:33,599
a year or two away before I release that

2152
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,339
that's what I'm working on right in my

2153
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,020
private stuff right now

2154
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:39,420
that's really cool stuff though yeah

2155
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:41,940
Malawi can be really resinous uh I

2156
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:45,420
always have a story like I learned

2157
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:48,839
that some like sativas will not flower

2158
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:50,340
under like normal 12 hours of light with

2159
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:53,100
Malawi that was the plant that I learned

2160
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:55,980
that with after three months of keeping

2161
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:58,140
it under 1212 and zero

2162
01:23:55,979 --> 01:24:00,000
sex straight showing up I'm like what is

2163
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:02,699
going on

2164
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,819
with the Congolese sativa one time I

2165
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:08,099
grew that out I was at week 16 or 17.

2166
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:10,859
yeah and the bugs were no no bigger than

2167
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:12,719
my little finger yeah and all my friends

2168
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:14,219
were like Jay you're you're an idiot why

2169
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,079
you could have pulled off two or three

2170
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:18,119
cops already and meanwhile they're just

2171
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,519
pulling down weights and I've got the

2172
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:23,158
six light room that I just I just cut it

2173
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,659
and threw in the garbage but yeah but if

2174
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:26,460
you if you don't experiment with those

2175
01:24:24,658 --> 01:24:29,639
you don't find the good ones either so

2176
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:31,980
that's very true yeah I have never seen

2177
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:33,420
it like that before

2178
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:35,459
like yeah I noticed that with the

2179
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:39,300
Congolese it was it wouldn't flower it

2180
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:41,219
would take so long to even kick off but

2181
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:44,159
was it from seed

2182
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:46,079
oh yes yes because one of the things

2183
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:48,299
that I learned

2184
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:50,219
um you know with some of the guys that

2185
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:52,560
had run like a bunch of the Neville's

2186
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:55,198
Haze and some of like the that kind of

2187
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,780
work in Holland was they told me like if

2188
01:24:55,198 --> 01:25:00,059
you take an old clone and you flower it

2189
01:24:57,779 --> 01:25:02,460
it's ready to flower because it's been

2190
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:05,280
alive for long enough that it knows it's

2191
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:07,319
it should be blooming but it hasn't

2192
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:09,960
and they said if you get some of these

2193
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:12,059
equatorial sativas going they're very

2194
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:13,880
used to like from seed knowing that they

2195
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:16,260
need to veg for six or seven months

2196
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:18,539
before they even want to think about

2197
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:20,820
flour so they said it can be very

2198
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:23,819
difficult to get an extreme sativa like

2199
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:25,979
that to trigger early

2200
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:28,738
because genetically it just doesn't want

2201
01:25:25,979 --> 01:25:30,238
to you know like you can force that you

2202
01:25:28,738 --> 01:25:33,238
can force the matter with light cycle

2203
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:36,178
but it's harder because it wants to it's

2204
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:37,979
almost like a pre-puberty you know human

2205
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:39,779
or something like until it hits that

2206
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:42,299
phase it's just not ready

2207
01:25:39,779 --> 01:25:43,519
so

2208
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,380
yeah yeah

2209
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,780
like and it makes sense right like you

2210
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:51,900
have a situation in which it's always 11

2211
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:54,479
13 or 12 12 or something like that near

2212
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:56,579
the equator like a Malawi or a Colombian

2213
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:59,339
or a Panamanian or maybe something like

2214
01:25:56,579 --> 01:26:01,800
that and they're just used to Growing

2215
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:03,480
for you know maybe even six seven months

2216
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:06,060
eight months before they bloom and then

2217
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:07,919
they bloom for five

2218
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:10,139
some of them take longer than a year

2219
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,158
from seed to finish because there is no

2220
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:14,159
winter

2221
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:16,559
they're terrified of dying under they

2222
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:18,960
don't it doesn't get cold enough to die

2223
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,520
that's true yeah if you want to grow

2224
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,920
those indoors it's best to keep them

2225
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,860
root Bound in a small container in the

2226
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,719
corner of the room for six months before

2227
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:30,539
yeah and then pull it back out again

2228
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:33,420
yeah no I brought home some Neville's

2229
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:34,979
Haze and I think it was 98 or 99 right

2230
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:37,020
around then the first year or two it was

2231
01:26:34,979 --> 01:26:40,379
released and I was planning on making

2232
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:42,300
all this seed and I set up this room and

2233
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,739
I couldn't even get the males to drop

2234
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:46,139
pollen

2235
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:47,519
you know for my like I had a whole room

2236
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:49,319
that was just ended up being head

2237
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,139
stashed because it was like you know 20

2238
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:53,460
different plants that I was thinking was

2239
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:55,619
going to make seed and there was no

2240
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:57,840
pollen to make seed and I had to restart

2241
01:26:55,619 --> 01:27:01,800
them and put more plants in there with

2242
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:03,960
the same males and wait some more

2243
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,600
and I did but I that was in the I didn't

2244
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,939
know the tricks of the light cycle to me

2245
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,280
when you bloomed everything was 12 12.

2246
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:14,039
that was what the book said that was

2247
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:17,460
what you did I never heard of 11 13 or

2248
01:27:14,039 --> 01:27:20,158
10 14 or any weird times like that it

2249
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:22,500
was like you know at the time the level

2250
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:23,939
of knowledge I had it was like 12 12 is

2251
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,219
what you do

2252
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:27,658
yeah

2253
01:27:25,219 --> 01:27:29,340
so you know learning

2254
01:27:27,658 --> 01:27:31,319
yeah what were some of the products that

2255
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:33,000
you what were some of the books that got

2256
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:34,500
you into growing like when you first

2257
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,719
started learning to grow were there

2258
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,899
books involved or just people

2259
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:43,980
um I was fortunate enough to uh

2260
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:45,719
get clocked down in Vancouver where uh I

2261
01:27:43,979 --> 01:27:47,819
learned from other Growers more than

2262
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:50,579
books yeah

2263
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:52,738
um and when when Jorge Cervantes was

2264
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:54,238
making his first books or maybe after

2265
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:58,079
the first books that I knew of anyway

2266
01:27:54,238 --> 01:28:01,259
yeah yeah he was he was up in Canada uh

2267
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:03,479
taking photos in my Grow rooms that's so

2268
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:08,219
funny some of the first books that I've

2269
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:10,559
seen were books that I was in yeah so so

2270
01:28:08,219 --> 01:28:14,539
yeah I I it was Hands-On Hands-On

2271
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,539
learning for me and that's awesome

2272
01:28:14,698 --> 01:28:18,299
yeah that's that's really really

2273
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:21,000
interesting not many people can uh say

2274
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:23,940
that they're first place that they were

2275
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,219
seeing had their grow room in it

2276
01:28:23,939 --> 01:28:28,859
so you have your your blueberry punch

2277
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:30,300
which is which a Romulan blueberry is

2278
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:33,719
that what it is correct very Romulan

2279
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:35,820
male which which Blue Line are you using

2280
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:37,560
um it was uh one that I

2281
01:28:35,819 --> 01:28:39,979
the one I'm using now

2282
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:43,500
um my for when I first I was a DJ Short

2283
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:45,479
uh blueberry from the late 90s

2284
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,219
and I crushed that with the grapefruit

2285
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:49,439
mail that I was using

2286
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:52,679
um and then back across that it was an

2287
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:54,119
F4 basically F4 blueberry that cross

2288
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:56,579
that I'm using

2289
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:58,979
um with my Romulan mail and that's

2290
01:28:56,579 --> 01:29:00,840
basically the one I'm using I'm actually

2291
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:03,718
doing a final hunt of that generation

2292
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:06,600
right now I've got about 40 females

2293
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:11,539
going right now oh nice I'm looking for

2294
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:11,539
a new a fresh blueberry to use yeah

2295
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:16,439
so if I have my main grow room where I

2296
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:18,600
make my seeds and then I have my five

2297
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:22,019
light go room where I've just constantly

2298
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:23,400
just testing and just drawing out things

2299
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:25,320
yeah

2300
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:27,779
yeah yeah I have a blueberry fiend

2301
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:29,759
myself so I understand the hunt for the

2302
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:32,340
perfect blue that's one of my uh

2303
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,659
favorite things in life yeah I was a lot

2304
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,520
a lot different than what you see as

2305
01:29:33,658 --> 01:29:37,738
blueberry on the market these days but

2306
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:40,260
we used to have different

2307
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:43,019
and way different than the Dutch Passion

2308
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:45,840
blueberry is nothing like the blueberry

2309
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:48,780
from back in the day yeah

2310
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,920
you know when that passion one is a lot

2311
01:29:48,779 --> 01:29:52,619
easier to grow

2312
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,319
yeah it looks a lot better nicer in a

2313
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:57,599
bag easier to trim uh but it just have

2314
01:29:55,319 --> 01:29:59,639
has no smell it's not that old fruity

2315
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,260
smell like the old blueberry had the

2316
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:02,880
Dutch don't seem to care that I noticed

2317
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:04,980
that a lot about some Dutch strains

2318
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,560
because they all mixed their weed with

2319
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:09,899
tobacco so for them the flavor

2320
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:12,900
isn't as important they the Dutch breed

2321
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:14,238
bred for a Healthy Growth structure and

2322
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:16,679
buds

2323
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:17,579
they weren't as concerned about the

2324
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:19,619
smell

2325
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,819
that makes a lot of sense with the fact

2326
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:21,840
that they were mixing it with tobacco

2327
01:30:20,819 --> 01:30:23,759
that they wouldn't have paid as much

2328
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,400
attention to that I used to battle with

2329
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,199
them about it yeah I bet me too I still

2330
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:29,279
do like that well I mean you know I

2331
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:32,519
would go over there and they would think

2332
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:34,198
I was nuts for smoking pure flour and

2333
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,699
not mixing it with a bunch of tobacco

2334
01:30:34,198 --> 01:30:37,019
you know or like the most common thing

2335
01:30:35,698 --> 01:30:40,559
they would they would do is they would

2336
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:43,440
make a a hashish snake that they would a

2337
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,539
thin a thin you know roll of hash and

2338
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:48,000
then they would roll tobacco around that

2339
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:51,600
and make a big spliff and start chiefing

2340
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,520
that and so I remember yeah the first

2341
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,719
couple cannabis cups in Amsterdam that I

2342
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,000
went to I went with a few other

2343
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:59,100
Canadians in Vancouver feedback my

2344
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,039
friends there and a few other breeders

2345
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:03,780
and they would make fun of us Canadians

2346
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:04,619
um because we would smoke pure joints

2347
01:31:03,779 --> 01:31:08,359
and they're like oh these are the

2348
01:31:04,619 --> 01:31:08,359
hardcore drug addicts they're smoking

2349
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:18,059
I don't actually smoke tobacco so I

2350
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:20,219
found it very difficult like especially

2351
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:23,699
in winter when Amsterdam is very cold

2352
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:26,399
and and kind of grimy to be in a coffee

2353
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:28,919
shop with like eight or nine spliffs

2354
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:31,198
going yeah the amount of and the amount

2355
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:33,300
of smoke and the amount of tobacco smoke

2356
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:35,698
and just me just wishing like like these

2357
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:38,279
places need a huge carbon filter right

2358
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:40,559
because yeah it was actually kind of

2359
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:43,738
intense like it's more tobacco than weed

2360
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:45,300
you prissy American I mean they thought

2361
01:31:43,738 --> 01:31:47,939
they thought it was they thought we were

2362
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:50,340
nuts for sure as far as the smoking pure

2363
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:52,678
cannabis you know but

2364
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:54,480
um but yeah it uh it's changing over

2365
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:56,880
there

2366
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:58,678
right I have I Matt and I argue about

2367
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,920
this but I almost think that like DJ

2368
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:04,679
shorts blue work is so inbred

2369
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,619
um that it works best in out crosses no

2370
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:09,719
I agree you know that like it's really

2371
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:12,658
hard I've grown a lot of his work trying

2372
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:15,179
to find like amazing examples of each

2373
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:17,219
line and it's really hard to do for me

2374
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:19,079
to find like the Grail that like looks

2375
01:32:17,219 --> 01:32:23,760
good and tastes good and has like

2376
01:32:19,079 --> 01:32:25,920
potency to it and isn't a leafy monster

2377
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,520
um but it seems to shine when you throw

2378
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,619
it on things that aren't it well I I

2379
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,659
think and I'm gonna stick by it until

2380
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:35,519
the day I die now and it wasn't from

2381
01:32:33,658 --> 01:32:37,079
anything that I did it was it was it was

2382
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,520
growing someone else's blueberry work

2383
01:32:37,079 --> 01:32:40,319
like

2384
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:42,780
um you know I I at the time when when

2385
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:44,279
this guy uh Lonestar from Texas resin

2386
01:32:42,779 --> 01:32:45,840
company when he released his blueberry

2387
01:32:44,279 --> 01:32:48,479
work I had released my first blueberry

2388
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,920
work so I had no interest in growing his

2389
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:51,238
because I already had the best you know

2390
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,460
I was like I got the best mine already

2391
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:56,039
smells like blueberries how much better

2392
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:58,020
could it be well mine was lacking resin

2393
01:32:56,039 --> 01:32:59,639
production and it was it was beautiful

2394
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:02,639
it was very purple it looked more like

2395
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:03,960
Oregon purple tie type more loose buds

2396
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,300
not dense

2397
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:08,760
um low resin production and just no

2398
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:10,800
recreational potency it had a lot of

2399
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,360
medical potency where where nerve pain

2400
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,520
and stuff it would dull it it was great

2401
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:15,960
for that but recreational people would

2402
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:18,060
just be like what is this garbage this

2403
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,439
isn't getting me high you know but I

2404
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,580
thought I had the best one and then I

2405
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:22,559
lost it

2406
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:23,939
um and I had to go through a bunch of

2407
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,800
blueberries and the first place I

2408
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:28,738
started looking was Canadian blueberries

2409
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:30,480
because in my experience Canadians that

2410
01:33:28,738 --> 01:33:32,879
was that era where people were starting

2411
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:35,279
to capture that super blueberry actual

2412
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,380
blueberry smell actual blueberry taste

2413
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:39,840
was in the Canadian blue line so that's

2414
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:42,000
where I started and I ended up going to

2415
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:44,940
this guy lone star's work who I'm not

2416
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,100
sure which blueberry line he used but it

2417
01:33:44,939 --> 01:33:49,619
seems like at some point near the end he

2418
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:52,020
outcrossed to some sort of Afghani let

2419
01:33:49,619 --> 01:33:55,260
the blue breed true the blue Terps and

2420
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:57,420
the blue uh flavors all that breed true

2421
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:59,460
but it doesn't breed like an inbred

2422
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:01,619
plant because of that because of that

2423
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:04,439
one single bat cross I can cross it to

2424
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:05,880
like his line to a blue velvet and not

2425
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:08,099
have too much inbreeding then all you

2426
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:11,460
get is the mutations and the you know

2427
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:13,440
foxtail look with no resin so yeah I'm

2428
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:16,520
pretty staunch on the blueberry needing

2429
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:16,519
an outcross at some point

2430
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,420
yeah I've uh yeah I've pretty much

2431
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:24,000
noticed the same thing uh the ones I've

2432
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:27,000
seen and it's yeah and the blueberry

2433
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,260
from back in the late 90s early 2000s in

2434
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,119
Vancouver there in British Columbia

2435
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:32,340
there was a lot of them and they were

2436
01:34:30,119 --> 01:34:33,420
very similar in some ways to uh the

2437
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:35,699
grapefruit

2438
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:37,440
yeah great food there were some

2439
01:34:35,698 --> 01:34:39,479
similarities

2440
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:42,238
but if you draw on a batch of the

2441
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:44,399
blueberry seeds

2442
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:46,138
some of DJ shorts crosses with the

2443
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:47,460
blueberries were always better than the

2444
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:50,100
straight blueberry

2445
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:52,139
yeah makes sense what's interesting too

2446
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:54,719
is that I think when he started selling

2447
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:57,179
his seeds first he started at sag Martha

2448
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:59,100
with Tony and then he ended up at Dutch

2449
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:00,899
Passion but he didn't really control

2450
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,340
that too much I think it was more like

2451
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:05,099
he sent him a bunch of seed and they

2452
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:06,600
made their own selections and then when

2453
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:09,239
he's when it started getting sold in

2454
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:12,420
Canada it's almost I think he kind of

2455
01:35:09,238 --> 01:35:15,059
took control of it again and was sending

2456
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:17,399
seed up there I had no idea what was

2457
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:19,260
going on did DJ go to work it was

2458
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:21,539
available it was available in Canada

2459
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:23,820
before Dutch Passion or anyone in Europe

2460
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:25,859
had it oh really I didn't know that oh

2461
01:35:23,819 --> 01:35:26,880
yeah so he was selling first through

2462
01:35:25,859 --> 01:35:28,979
Canada

2463
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,159
no there was there was clones I've been

2464
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:34,319
going around when I started oh wow yeah

2465
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:36,899
I mean Oregon his where he's from isn't

2466
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:39,380
very far from from you know

2467
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:42,059
Vancouver and stuff yeah

2468
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:43,739
yeah he'd make regular trips into Canada

2469
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:45,120
and I believe he did some work with uh

2470
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:47,939
spice of life

2471
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:50,238
yeah yeah Steve back then yeah Stephen

2472
01:35:47,939 --> 01:35:50,238
Ray

2473
01:35:52,819 --> 01:35:58,738
had some of uh DJ shorts blueberry that

2474
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:01,679
came straight from him

2475
01:35:58,738 --> 01:36:03,718
that makes sense yeah that's wild they

2476
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,279
yeah I never really realized that that

2477
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:08,460
the Clones are going up before they were

2478
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:09,719
even released in Europe like the seed

2479
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:12,179
lines are released in Europe the Clones

2480
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:14,579
were going up you gotta remember at the

2481
01:36:12,179 --> 01:36:16,800
time that the that sag Martha and those

2482
01:36:14,579 --> 01:36:20,100
groups were selling it this is kind of

2483
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:22,079
pre the Canadian seed selling at least

2484
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,400
to the public that was easy and well

2485
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:25,979
known

2486
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:28,439
um you know it really was only Holland

2487
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:31,698
am I right like that like Canadian seed

2488
01:36:28,439 --> 01:36:31,698
selling happened a little bit later

2489
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:36,779
yeah it actually pretty much would Mark

2490
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:39,920
first started and then Kyle with kind

2491
01:36:36,779 --> 01:36:41,460
seed that would have been around

2492
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,319
94.

2493
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:44,880
yeah I believe

2494
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:47,039
right right in there at that ball yeah

2495
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,199
yeah

2496
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:51,719
I mean I was sharing with Matt before we

2497
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:53,819
did this I have like some we I have some

2498
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:55,800
like uh old cannabis cultures and some

2499
01:36:53,819 --> 01:36:59,519
different stuff and we were like looking

2500
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:01,500
over like the Federation list in Mark's

2501
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,300
catalog and different stuff you know and

2502
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:05,579
and you know DJ was in there he had his

2503
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:08,400
four things I think it was like blue

2504
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:11,479
velvet Blue Heaven blueberry and flow

2505
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:15,179
maybe something like that yeah yeah

2506
01:37:11,479 --> 01:37:18,119
you know and and so he was in there

2507
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:20,100
yeah in the early years of uh of of

2508
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:21,599
those things being advertised you know

2509
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,980
there was definitely people selling his

2510
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,739
stuff

2511
01:37:22,979 --> 01:37:27,500
high dollar high dollar for that for the

2512
01:37:25,738 --> 01:37:30,658
era a super high dollar

2513
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:32,158
insane high prices back then

2514
01:37:30,658 --> 01:37:34,319
I wish I could still get those prices

2515
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:36,359
wouldn't that be nice too yeah wouldn't

2516
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:38,698
that be nice I remember those prices

2517
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:41,039
just a few years ago I didn't around no

2518
01:37:38,698 --> 01:37:42,658

2519

I have I know that's more popular in the

2529
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,739
south is uh truffles

2544
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:43,920
the one we have right now

2545
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:46,020
um yeah finally released it again so

2546
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:48,000
yeah I've got so many strains right now

2547
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:51,060
it's hard to wrap my head around anyone

2548
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,800
in particular yeah I'm stoked to see

2549
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:55,199
ring Romulan back too you know like I

2550
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,179
said there's there's been many cases of

2551
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:59,039
many different companies none in

2552
01:38:57,179 --> 01:39:00,960
particular that I'm referring to but

2553
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:03,539
many companies coming out claiming that

2554
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:05,880
they have pure Romulan you know or this

2555
01:39:03,539 --> 01:39:08,219
Romulan hybrid and you know they're

2556
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:11,940
newer people and probably don't you know

2557
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:14,399
and it's good to see a a reputable

2558
01:39:11,939 --> 01:39:15,719
person that you know has good provenance

2559
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:17,460
with this stuff that's worked it for

2560
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:20,158
years that knows it bringing it back

2561
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:21,179
bringing back with the real name and

2562
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:23,039
everything

2563
01:39:21,179 --> 01:39:24,658
there's uh the Romulan here in Canada

2564
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:26,639
there's just one going around on the

2565
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:29,519
recreational Market uh in all the stores

2566
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:31,139
that they sell as Romulan and that

2567
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,000
actually was Romulan Joe that first

2568
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:36,060
showed me a bag when I went to see him a

2569
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,979
few months ago and uh we looked at it we

2570
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:40,620
tried some together and we were like no

2571
01:39:37,979 --> 01:39:43,259
this is a Romulan grapefruit cross oh

2572
01:39:40,619 --> 01:39:45,599
man I was guaranteed it's a older I'm in

2573
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:47,039
the grapefruit of mine yeah that's going

2574
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:49,320
down it's definitely not the original

2575
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:52,319
and there's also pyramid seeds now in

2576
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:54,420
Spain they've released a Romulan but

2577
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:56,099
it's also but it's a Romulan cross that

2578
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:59,819
I had in Spain that my friend of mine is

2579
01:39:56,100 --> 01:40:01,560
making for them so they were selling is

2580
01:39:59,819 --> 01:40:04,500
not the Romulan as well but it's it's

2581
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:07,199
got some Romulan genetics in it but yeah

2582
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:10,619
I know other than other Growers that

2583
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:12,419
might have the uh something as close as

2584
01:40:10,619 --> 01:40:14,179
me would be Vic High

2585

yeah yeah he did pass away now but he

2587
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:22,500
had a really good version of it as well

2588
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:24,960
oh yeah a little bit more of a fruitier

2589
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:26,279
version but it was nice it was very nice

2590
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,279
yeah

2591
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:31,380

2592
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:33,840
um yeah I'm doing gonna be doing a lot

2593
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,739

2595
01:40:34,738 --> 01:40:39,419

2600
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:50,460
genetics to try it down in their climate

2601
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:52,560
and that's one thing in South America

2602
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:53,520
too especially in Chile they get a lot

2603
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,219
of rain

2604
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,620
so there's a lot of interest in our mold

2605
01:40:56,219 --> 01:41:01,139
resistant Strays down there that's

2606
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:03,059
awesome teaming up with a few breeders

2607
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:05,400
down there and uh

2608
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:08,159
and so we'll see how it goes

2609
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:10,439
well I'm Gonna Keep well keep the

2610
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:12,420
facility in Canada and operation

2611
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:14,819
but uh in Canada with legalization

2612
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:17,340
there's not much money to be made here

2613
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:19,259
anymore yeah it's really really

2614
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:21,659
difficult to make a living

2615
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:23,579
and that the people are just bombarded

2616
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:24,859
with store read there's a store on every

2617
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:28,500
corner

2618
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:30,599
and unless you're a real

2619
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:33,479
grower is really passionate about it

2620
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:35,219
people here don't buy uh buy seeds

2621
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:37,859
anymore and there's so many other Gators

2622
01:41:35,219 --> 01:41:39,079
that just flooded the market

2623
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:41,219
yep

2624
01:41:39,079 --> 01:41:44,219
I just don't see much of a future myself

2625
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:46,139
for myself in Canada anymore so

2626
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:47,460
I'm gonna probably start making the

2627
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:49,500
transition

2628
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:51,600
yeah over the next for the next few

2629
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:53,698
months or the next year so

2630
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:56,460
it's only a matter of time in my opinion

2631
01:41:53,698 --> 01:41:58,439
for the US is is just right behind you

2632
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:01,380
guys and the way that you're seeing it I

2633
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:03,118
think is is really a very realistic and

2634
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:04,800
smart Direction I really really believe

2635
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:08,219
that are you going to be doing any land

2636
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,199
race hunting while you're down there

2637
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:12,600
um knock off I'm going to be bringing

2638
01:42:10,198 --> 01:42:14,339
some of them my my Colombian and a few

2639
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:17,760
of those trains for people down there to

2640
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:19,800
grow out and test out yeah

2641
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,659
but at first when I'm first going to get

2642
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,060
established down there with my Flagship

2643
01:42:21,658 --> 01:42:25,979
strains like the the Romulan the Island

2644
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:28,860
Suites account the dynamite the time

2645
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:30,959
warp my most popular strain is going to

2646
01:42:28,859 --> 01:42:33,839
get established first before I get too

2647
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,980
experimental down there yeah yeah right

2648
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,440
so

2649
01:42:34,979 --> 01:42:40,079
that's one of the things I'll say about

2650
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:42,839
about the Romulan is is as we are as

2651
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:43,439
we're all getting older you know

2652
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,600
um

2653
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:48,059
a lot of things for especially for new

2654
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:51,060
smokers and stuff like that they hear

2655
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:52,980
things like nl5 or Romulan or this or

2656
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:55,380
that or whatever and they're famous

2657
01:42:52,979 --> 01:42:56,279
names that they know almost nothing else

2658
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:58,739
about

2659
01:42:56,279 --> 01:43:00,479
and so Romulan is definitely one that

2660
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:02,158
whether or not you have any access to

2661
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:04,618
the real Romulan or you just have a

2662
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:07,559
hybrid or whatever the name is going to

2663
01:43:04,618 --> 01:43:10,099
get used because it's a catchy name it's

2664
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:12,780
stuck it's part of cannabis history now

2665
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:16,320
and it was prevalent enough and popular

2666
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:19,559
enough that young people they want to

2667
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:21,059
try the best things of yesteryear and

2668
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:22,800
there's people out there that want to

2669
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,119
give them what they want whether they

2670
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,179
have it or not

2671
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:28,859
you know yeah

2672
01:43:26,179 --> 01:43:30,539
that's for sure

2673
01:43:28,859 --> 01:43:31,979
yeah with my Romulan when I moved back

2674
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:34,019
to Canada

2675
01:43:31,979 --> 01:43:36,178
um my partner was like hey just work on

2676
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:38,060
that Romulan everybody asked for it and

2677
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:41,279
I've been working for five years now

2678
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:44,340
before I get to release it because now

2679
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:48,238
I'm confident in what it it is I'm happy

2680
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:50,279
to put my behind it but uh we for years

2681
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:51,899
we got asked to bring the Romulan back

2682
01:43:50,279 --> 01:43:53,939
and I guess I'm working on it but I'm

2683
01:43:51,899 --> 01:43:56,099
not going to release it until

2684
01:43:53,939 --> 01:43:59,519
until I'm you know I'm proud to put my

2685
01:43:56,100 --> 01:44:01,560
name behind it so yeah we're finally at

2686
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:03,179
that point now so

2687
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:05,219
you know it's funny I was talking to

2688
01:44:03,179 --> 01:44:07,800
your partner and he's like yeah you know

2689
01:44:05,219 --> 01:44:09,118
I know a little bit but I was mostly on

2690
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,340
the back side you need to talk to Jane

2691
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:12,599

2692
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:13,980

sometime as well because just the uh his

2714
01:45:03,658 --> 01:45:07,979
side of the business is to me is just as

2715
01:45:06,179 --> 01:45:09,420
important as you know even the breeding

2716
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:12,059
side of the business that there's a lot

2717
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:14,399
of history he knows so much history and

2718
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:16,440
backstories about what went on behind

2719
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:18,899
the scenes who got what when you know

2720
01:45:16,439 --> 01:45:20,698
who who got what batch of seeds wed and

2721
01:45:18,899 --> 01:45:22,618
know what behind what strain probably

2722
01:45:20,698 --> 01:45:25,439
you know he probably has a lot of info

2723
01:45:22,618 --> 01:45:29,219
like that yeah as far as the Dutch team

2724
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,658
goes uh he knows that very very well

2725
01:45:29,219 --> 01:45:32,760
um yeah better than the British Columbia

2726
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:34,559
scene because he was over there during

2727
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:37,860
those days time seed was one of the

2728
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:39,239
biggest seed sellers yeah to America in

2729
01:45:37,859 --> 01:45:40,439
those days

2730
01:45:39,238 --> 01:45:42,919
um it's kind of like seeds men or

2731
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:45,419
Attitude seeds are now

2732

I smell a plant I'm like oh that smells

2760
01:46:45,779 --> 01:46:50,099
like something I grew 22 years ago and

2761
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:52,379
it was in this town under this flight

2762
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:55,199
and it was May and I just ate a hot dog

2763
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:58,199
you know it's you know yeah oh yeah yeah

2764
01:46:55,198 --> 01:47:00,299
memories I feel that I mean Matt and I

2765
01:46:58,198 --> 01:47:02,579
we talk a lot about there's certain

2766
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:04,980
people that you talk to and they're

2767
01:47:02,579 --> 01:47:07,319
extremely vague about some of the stuff

2768
01:47:04,979 --> 01:47:08,939
that they do and for me being like a you

2769
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:11,579
know a weed nerd or something like that

2770
01:47:08,939 --> 01:47:13,079
since it's like so much of my life like

2771
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:14,880
someone wants to talk about it like you

2772
01:47:13,079 --> 01:47:16,319
said I can be like oh yeah it was like I

2773
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,880
did this and it would smell like that

2774
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:20,158
and this happened and I remember I was

2775
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:22,380
and you were wearing that because it's

2776
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:24,960
just so part of it you know you can talk

2777
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:26,880
confidently about stuff that because you

2778
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,100
spend every day with it people won't

2779
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,859
realize that growing and breeding is day

2780
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:33,239
in day out you have to have success yeah

2781
01:47:31,859 --> 01:47:35,279
and you have to stack those days

2782
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:36,779
together for a long period of time to

2783
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:40,519
get to where you want to go

2784
01:47:36,779 --> 01:47:40,519
