1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,119
um you know but can can we say

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,919
that

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,919
at least for right now that the truth is

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
cloudy

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,079
can truth be cloudy

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,000
sure i mean truth is also it's also

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,000
relative there are personal truths and

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,278
then there are universal truths right

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,879
your religion your cultural affiliations

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,879
you know those are all your political

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,640
affiliations those are personal truths

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,160
they're true to you

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,558
but then you have universal truths like

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,719
gravity right and so therein lies a

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,599
conundrum sometimes personal truths can

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,280
be conflated with with universal truths

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,760
so we have to we have to be mindful of

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
that but look lou here

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,280
anybody who is in the government and by

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
the way they can verify it knows i still

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,840
hold the t at top secret security

22
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,640
clearance right there's a reason okay

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,559
a if i tell the quickest way for me to

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,280
have my security clearance revoked or

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,959
suspended is a if i provide an

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,879
unauthorized disclosure i provide

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,520
classified information in an

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,759
unauthorized manner the other way is by

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
lying if i lie just like i can't talk

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,159
about national secrets i also can't lie

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,519
to the american public because that also

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,520
will hold a be held against me for

33
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,158
security clearance reason so i always

34
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,280
have to ride this very fine line and

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,040
people just assume oh he's

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,960
disinformation

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
i can't lie to the american people

38
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,798
because i will have my security

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,880
clearance removed because that is a site

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,000
part of the psychological evaluation

41
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,319
someone is a is a is a confirmed

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,040
pathological liar that is an indicator

43
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,879
usually of some sort of of psychological

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,000
issues those people can't hold security

45
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,239
clearances

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,239
also
