[Music]

12
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,319
so this is the first time we're trying

13
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,778
this on YouTube I think we're live I

14
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,060
don't know I hope so but um not so it's

15
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:26,338
out today he's at a wedding so today I

16
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,799
decided to bring in the homie smell boat

17
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,120
from smell boat seeds um originally when

18
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,099
I was going to start the first podcast

19
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,440
when I started doing live streams this

20
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,240
is who I was going to do that with and

21
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,980
he got busy with other stuff in life and

22
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,079
we're both Stoners so we just lagged and

23
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,000
never worked out but I'm super stoked to

24
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,078
bring him on because he's probably one

25
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,539
of the people I have the most fun

26
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,539
talking with and I know everyone will

27
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:50,338
Super enjoy him so without further Ado

28
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:55,039

29
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,040

smell boat on Counter-Strike and uh it

47
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,820
sucked to get killed by the smell boat

48
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,500
captain because I bet dude who's the

49
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,720

54
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,320
baseball games they would say players

55
00:14:54,778 --> 00:15:00,120
names they'd be off Carl Larry so yeah I

56

his own thing at the same time in a

295
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,940
different area so let's talk about how

296
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,200
you started dude I mean we've never

297
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,460
covered it on The Syndicate it's been

298
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,220
covered elsewhere but I'd like to cut

299
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,079
right just to just to jump off yeah so

300
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:41,100
you know

301
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:42,960
I grew up around it so like literally I

302
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,859
remember the first plants I actually

303
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,919
grew myself I hid in the front yard of a

304
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:53,939
small town in Oklahoma because my dad

305
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,340
had got caught with 180 kilos and we we

306
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,200
left California you know obvious reasons

307
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:01,259
and we moved to Oklahoma because it's a

308
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,720
much more lenient state in the 80s in

309
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,658
California

310
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,500
I mean why wouldn't we go to Oklahoma

311
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:11,640
why not yeah dude so

312
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,400
he's there

313
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,020
the so just honestly the whole story is

314
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,240
my grandfather was the chief of police

315
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,099
my dad's brothers were both sheriffs my

316
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,779
dad got caught with 180 Keys did a

317
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:23,879
couple of months when he went to court

318
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:27,119
there was no marijuana left the

319
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,059
marijuana had vanished yeah it walked

320
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,339
away yeah left so they let him out

321
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:34,319
he went to my grandma's grabbed a bunch

322
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,480
of pounds out of the attic and we drove

323
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,099
to Oklahoma and lived there for four or

324
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,900
five years so like things could calm

325
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:45,418
down so yeah I really didn't know like

326
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,700
I think I was like I mean my first

327
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,500
memories in life were always smelling

328
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,120
skunks and [ __ ] you know like yeah my

329
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,400
dad would come in with giant black trash

330
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,259
bags full of weed you know and trim it

331
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,700
in the house and all that I'm sure I

332
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,919
always went to school smelling like

333
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,319
marijuana I remember when Reagan and

334
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,240
then started the Dare program the cops

335
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,460
always wanted to talk to me and I didn't

336
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,558
ever understand why you know but I had

337
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,600
to run down I knew what was going on so

338
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,298
anyways I grew this little these little

339
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,158
plants I used to collect other seeds and

340
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:16,139
my uncle would mow the yard like once a

341
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,299
year so he went out and mowed the yard

342
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,600
and there was these giant pot plants in

343
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:23,339
the front yard literally and uh so that

344
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,079
was the first time I grew it and then I

345
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:27,298
got obsessed so everywhere we'd go

346
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,339
fishing I would grow little plants I'd

347
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:31,619
go and grow put little seeds in the

348
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:33,778
ground and uh then uh

349
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,639
I would literally start I started to

350
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:38,460
learn that if I put paper bags over the

351
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,278
top of the plants they if it would make

352
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,019
them flower and and so I would leave

353
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,940
little paper bags and we'd come back the

354
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,139
next weekend and I take the paper bag

355
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,298
off and then there'd be like these

356
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,059
little eight inch plants that head start

357
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:52,619
at the very flower yeah dude I didn't

358
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:54,960
want to smoke it or anything else I just

359
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,879
like you know [ __ ] around yeah my

360
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,038
first really big growth is when I got

361
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,900
out of the army I was pretty mentally

362
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,058
busted up

363
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,700
um like my brain was [ __ ] I went

364
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:07,678
through a bunch of [ __ ] and oh God it's

365
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,319
a long story ends up

366
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,720
so I was looking for a place to grow

367
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:16,619
like that was what I wanted to do it was

368
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:20,339
about 1997 and I just wanted to like

369
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:22,678
spend uh summer away check out and all

370
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:24,899
that [ __ ] and uh so there's a little

371
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,519
town here called Three Rivers there

372
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,340
Three Rivers California it's right at

373
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,079
the base of the Sequoias and uh

374
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,959
I went up there and a friend of mine's

375
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:36,000
brother had this big side of a mountain

376
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,519
that was completely there's nothing

377
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,298
there's nothing it was right off of the

378
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:45,179
road no roads no water no anything so

379
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:47,220
my bright idea was to hey let's start

380
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,778
growing on the side of the mountain and

381
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,579
let's go from the bottom all the way up

382
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:52,558
to the top so I have to climb this

383
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:54,960
mountain every [ __ ] day that doesn't

384
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,079
have water with water on my back like a

385
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,579
mule yeah yeah so I do it and I'm

386
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,599
killing it man and these plants are

387
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,918
getting big and they're getting

388
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:04,439
beautiful and

389
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,820
uh spring comes you know and the rains

390
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,140
come back then we used to get a pretty

391
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:08,879
good amount of rain and I started

392
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,100
getting these there was a creek that ran

393
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,100
down it so I started setting up these

394
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,500
big 300 gallon water drops down into the

395
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,658
ground so as the creek ran it captured

396
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,538
it and it made that life a lot easier

397
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,580
well one day I was hauling ass like

398
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:25,500
running from the top of the hill down to

399
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:27,658
the bottom and I fell through the

400
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,839
[ __ ] ground and it was a goddamn

401
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:34,200
rattlesnake pit and I've never I never

402
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:36,538
knew that rattlesnakes like

403
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,179
get together like

404
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:41,339
like thousands of [ __ ] rattlesnakes

405
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,778
will like turn into a ball and do

406
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,699
rattlesnake [ __ ] I don't know what the

407
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,940
[ __ ] they were doing that is gross I

408
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:51,120
fell into this hole like thigh deep and

409
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,820
it sounded like a buzz saw went off and

410
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,619
um I ran and I never went back and I

411
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:58,519
never checked on my plants and I said

412
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:02,099
[ __ ] that bro and yeah

413
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:04,679
[ __ ] falling into rattlesnakes dude I

414
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,719
was so freaked the [ __ ] out so then the

415
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,298
following year I didn't grow on that

416
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,720
land anymore I got this uh old Rancher

417
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:13,859
guy up in [ __ ] Valley who had 180 Acres

418
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,019
or so

419
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:19,199
and it was really cool I had this old

420
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,058
movie set on it and [ __ ] like in the uh

421
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,620
70s or 80s they were doing a western

422
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:24,960
movie so

423
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,058
it was literally a facade like you go

424
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,079
down the road and it was just like faces

425
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:33,178
of these old saloons and motels yeah and

426
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:34,439
they had built this massive [ __ ]

427
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,538
hotel up there

428
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,940
like the fireplace in this hotel is like

429
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:42,000
the size of my house and uh it was

430
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,120
completely flooded out well the story

431
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,339
has it is that they were doing a western

432
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:49,319
and all the movie never got made and

433
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:51,599
then when the people who were like

434
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,278
paying for the movie showed up it was

435
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,219
just a bunch of people running around

436
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,619
naked doing LSD and Coke so they pulled

437
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,778
the plug on the movie left everything up

438
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:04,619
there this guy bought it turned it into

439
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:07,500
like a huge cattle ranch and uh base

440
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:10,459
just let me have free will and that year

441
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,440

442
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,200

487
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,020
just [ __ ] and once again I got so

488
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,100
tired and fed up with the partner back

489
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,740
then

490
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:11,538
um kind of down to falling out kind of

491
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:14,038
had M16s pointed at me yeah um

492
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:16,919
I was only a little bit out of the

493
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:20,278
Infantry so I also was handy with

494
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,919
weapons yeah so I it it crossed my my

495
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:25,159
mind to go and take what was mine yeah

496
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,960
but I thought better of it

497
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,419
yeah I made I made the effort to be

498
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,759
happy and build a really big nice indoor

499
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:35,100
grow and that's kind of where I got my

500
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,140
indoor grout was from yeah that [ __ ]

501
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:38,819
you know and then my indoor grow just

502
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,200
got bigger and bigger and bigger and

503
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:42,000
more and more and

504
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,620
and then once again I got too [ __ ]

505
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,019
busy because I like to do everything by

506
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:48,599
my goddamn self and

507
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,980
it doesn't work like when you have Lupus

508
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:54,740
and [ __ ] like you're all like I'm gonna

509
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,740
take on [ __ ] 64 lights and

510
00:32:55,819 --> 00:33:02,639
then I find myself laying on the couch

511
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:05,220
yeah everything hurts yeah I said but I

512
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,840
kind of covered the start yeah yeah I

513
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,058
think that covers the start I think it

514
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,918
comes to start the seeds seed part

515
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:13,139
though you remember me telling you all

516
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,600
the time like I used to be obsessed with

517
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,299
like one branching yeah so like I would

518
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,099
just have males and to preserve the

519
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:23,278
genetics I would literally take a male

520
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:25,379
and see that one branch and then I that

521
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,960
Branch would get captain those seeds so

522
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,899
my collection of seeds is absolutely

523
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,278
[ __ ] massive of one branching you

524
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:35,518
know yes yeah yeah there's lots of

525
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:38,700
different types yeah and then um

526
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,880
I got really really serious about it

527
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,980
when I hallucinated from a that

528
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,940
chocolate cherry one that yeah they

529
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,220
don't do it

530
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,019
made me feel like I was on mushrooms I

531
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,819
was like you know what this is gonna be

532
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,558

533
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:55,019

543
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,579

544
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,279
like you know it interacts with me to

545
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:20,940

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,659
keeping seeds around it and making seeds

554
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,878
and joining the the seed Revolution it

555
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,159
was like three years yes three years

556
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:46,460
it's like three years of y'all you need

557
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,019
to release seeds

558
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,639
I like the stuff I was singing it was

559
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:54,059
during a lot of it was during the

560
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,378
beginning of the cookies era and and but

561
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,820
it was right at that point where we're

562
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:59,039
like okay we're sick of seeing cookies

563
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,660
the secret seeing cookie stuff what can

564
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,920
you do that's unique with cookies and

565
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:04,618
you found a way to make some of the most

566
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,380
beautiful absolutely beautiful but still

567
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,880
wreckingly potent [ __ ] so let's talk

568
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,000
about what you were working with to get

569
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,220
to that point yeah so funny how this

570
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,838
worked out so there was a website called

571
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,358
canazon do you remember that well I

572
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:20,099
remember Canada so Canada I had a really

573
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:23,039
good friend on Canada's on that went by

574
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:25,260
the name smoke he was from Canada

575
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:28,800
and that is where I sourced that

576
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:32,119
chocolate of the chocolate tie yeah okay

577
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,700

00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:43,618
um there's tie it for sure but it's a

581
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,359
few different things I think there's two

582
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:48,119
definitely different males yeah it is

583
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,679
and with one female two sing uh

584
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,300
flowering time yeah that's I think

585
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,480
that's what rev was doing he didn't want

586

really pretty flower but every grow

600
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,940
he did one branching and that's how he

601
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,560
became friends because I told him about

602
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,800
like oh my god dude this is how I used

603
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:40,559
to do it yeah yeah and he sent me

604
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,880
literally like 10 seeds of everything he

605
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:45,960
had ever done

606
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:49,140

608
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,078
familiar

609
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,300
yeah I'm sure I knew who he was from pop

610
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,900
pimp or something yeah and he was uh he

611
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,539
spoke French better than English so I

612
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,660
used to translate all back then you

613
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:05,579
could still use [ __ ] translator yeah

614
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:08,179
I would write in English translated all

615
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:10,740
into French and send it to him

616
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:12,419

617
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:14,098
horrible I know why you can't keep

618
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,838
accosting him like that with all this

619
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:19,619
sexual innuendo

620
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:22,259
so dude I still email with him at least

621
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:24,358
once a year oh that's cool and he still

622
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,000
has 12 of the original chocolate seeds

623
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:30,659
oh really twelve of them

624
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,519
um he said this so he stabbed somebody a

625
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:35,879
few years back that he called them

626
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,800
gorillas I tried to Rob him

627
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,420
um he stabbed one of them had to go do

628
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,579

629
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,500
probation all this [ __ ] just crazy stuff

630
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,780
and he says as soon as everything dies

631
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,539
down those seeds are mine so I can look

632
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,839
deeper into it so let's see hopefully

633
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:54,539

634
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:57,838

638
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,000
the revs

639
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,699
I'm not kidding who the people who got

640
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,739
to smoke it it was literally like a

641
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:15,419
chocolate cherry candy like it was not

642
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:17,578
even have pictures of this now getting

643
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,760
some milky chocolate with a cherry

644
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:23,820
finish and that's it was [ __ ]

645
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,119
stunning so that's the one that made me

646
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:29,940
hallucinate it did like I went and laid

in there it is it was so [ __ ] bad it

648
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,320
was there that that's with the rainbow

649
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,618
so that is that chocolate rainbow Cherry

650
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,079
with back to uh rainbow back into it

651
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,838
because chocolate cherry I took a meal

652
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,079
from that and hit triangle with it and

653
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:48,960
that made what I ended up finding my red

654
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,700
vine that's right yeah that's right and

655
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,220
then I took a mail from Red Vine and

656
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:55,139
ogkv had just hit the scene and it's

657
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:57,838
super intrigued to my ass because it

658
00:38:55,139 --> 00:39:00,179
looked like a duck foot this plant used

659
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,039
to get called duck foot uh it looked

660
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:03,838
like some of the Urkel mutants that we

661
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,079
used to find in the seeds and [ __ ] like

662
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:09,960
that and uh so it intrigued the [ __ ] it

663
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,480
out of me I got a cut of it and I hit it

664
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,579
with the chocolate cherry the ogkp

665
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,500
didn't get me super ripped like I could

666
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:19,680
smoke a joint of it and be all like oh

667
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:22,079
I'm chill you know yeah but I wanted to

668
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,960
see what this crazy 12 foot [ __ ]

669
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,420
[ __ ] plant and this weirdo slow

670
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,099
plant would do when they got after it

671
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,920
you know so

672
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:33,838
the red vine was that Medium though so

673
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,480
you got the chocolate cherry in there

674
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,880
now that I created that with triangle

675
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,460
that's where I found red vine Now red

676
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,858
vine isn't the name of that that cross

677
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,679
because I used to not name my crosses I

678
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:48,719
just this is what it is you know red

679
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,399
vine was that Mom there was a certain

680
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,319
plant named red vine because it tasted

681
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,838
like the licorice

682
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,740
um and then so a mill from that went to

683
00:39:54,838 --> 00:40:00,659
ogkb the first [ __ ] seat I found uh I

684
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:02,098
started to flower it and I looked at it

685
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:04,920
and I was like God damn that plant's

686
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:07,740
special I took a bud off of it yeah and

687
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,960
I put it back into and closed it and

688
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:12,419
everything like that and uh a little

689
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,400
shoot came out that was rainbow rainbow

690
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,380
almost never happened

691
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,900
because it was the first seed I [ __ ]

692
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,640
pause and my eye told me that I didn't

693
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,400
take a colon off of it because yeah it's

694
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,319
the first [ __ ] seat and that first

695
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,900
[ __ ] scene I went and took a little

696
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,280
white-handed flower later on because I

697
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,900
liked the structure I liked everything

698
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,599
about it that [ __ ] started getting

699
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,240
resin like in week two like it's all I'm

700
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,720
growing I'm growing hairs and resin you

701
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:41,639
know this is kind of weird so it ended

702
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,779
up reveging I actually think I took like

703
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:47,159
12 clothes off of that bed

704
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,320
yeah off no off of the [ __ ] plant

705
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:50,940
with the Buns like okay I do there's

706
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,920
something was telling me that this plant

707
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,260
there's something about it you know yeah

708
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,380
so I took a ton of [ __ ] cuts off of

709
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,180
it uh one of them came out quick the

710
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,400
next ones took a little longer there was

711
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:05,159
one that took over a [ __ ] year to

712
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,139
actually finally grow oh my God how did

713
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:10,139
that little white tip but by then I had

714
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:12,440
already flowered her ass smothered grown

715
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:15,000
and he kept it around anyways

716
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,500
yep and still get that [ __ ] because I

717
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,239
was like didn't you bet you're gonna

718
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,159
live forever yeah you're gonna keep

719
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,659
fighting now that you live I remember I

720
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,098
had a train wreck and it was it was when

721
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:24,960
I decided to get rid of train wreck and

722
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:27,420
I took it out and he was like the last

723
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,579
clone in a Solo Cup at the time in an

724
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,440
apartment I took it out and I set it on

725
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:33,000
a table and I swear to God two weeks

726
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,800
later I went by I looked and that [ __ ]

727
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,659
was still alive just living there and

728
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,519
threw it on the table I'm like I guess

729
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:41,480
I'll keep you again you know he said it

730
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:41,480
died of course after that

731
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:46,500
they can survive in the worst [ __ ] but

732
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,200
once you bring him back and try to

733
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,800

760
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:55,679
got to get away from everything I've

761
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,200
been working like crazy

762
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,500
um my breeding projects I'm probably

763
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:04,318
four or five projects in since the

764
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,719
[ __ ] original Rainbow yeah I did um

765
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,119
people kept asking me for female seeds

766
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:12,239
so I did a female project with both

767
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,579
reversing rainbow I didn't like how

768
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:17,818
rainbow reverse she was hard to reverse

769
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:19,619
so I took sis and sister reversed a lot

770
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:22,500
easier and

771
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:28,740

772
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:31,318

rainbow sisters like rainbow right yeah

786
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:04,200
she's more purple and you get more of

787
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,660
this chocolate Menthol than you do with

788
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:10,500
the rainbow you get like a

789
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:12,838
hard to explain pine-ish

790
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,719
Funk that

791
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:18,480
if you smoke rainbow in a room and like

792
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:20,519
you you know like like let's say I went

793
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,619
down to your house you've smoked it

794
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:24,659
you've seen it I could go to your house

795
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,579
and you could smoke whatever you wanted

796
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:28,739
and I can come in there and know when

797
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:31,680
you smoked rainbow she leaves this

798
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:35,039
Essence in the [ __ ] air of it I can't

799
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:38,399
really explain yeah sister I can't

800
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:40,739
explain it really carried the smoothness

801
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,900
of chocolate now I think you don't get

802
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:44,818
the barrier any of that back on the back

803
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,920
end it's like mint ball chocolate yeah

804
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:48,358
it's almost like one of those Peppermint

805
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,619
Patties but I don't want to say that

806
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:52,259
because that's this is the one that

807
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:54,119
Brynn liked right the chocolate the

808
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,400
chocolate Fino or the rainbow yep yep

809
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:57,780
yep that's the one yeah right yes yeah

810
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,940
yeah so

811
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,160
so I reversed her and that's where I

812
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,980
made a whole bunch of [ __ ] films with

813
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:07,078
her I crossed so many strings that I

814
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,480
actually liked like I actually liked

815
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,460
wedding cake so it's one of the newer

816
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,139
strains that I liked

817
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,079
um and then I did a bunch of old stuff

818
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:18,480
triangle the San Diego cut

819
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,280
um that you have to grow or see because

820
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,719
you have to it's one that we've talked

821
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,400
about for years

822
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,500
um

823
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,760
uh [ __ ] what else did I [ __ ] great

824
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:31,619
pie

825
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:34,560
um it's great too yes dude uh Urkel uh

826
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:36,059
SR-71 Urkel whatever [ __ ] I swear

827
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,799
they're the same plants that just kind

828
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:41,759
of veered off into two different houses

829
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,079
right uh they just got uh just a bunch

830
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,819
of stuff so that was one of the first

831
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,680
projects you remember you were sending

832
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:49,739
me the reversal spray yep that was like

833
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:52,259
three [ __ ] years ago yes it was it

834
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:54,358
was like when we went to the cup yeah it

835
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:58,200
was right when I got home I sent you

836
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:59,578
some spray you simply sprayed and then I

837
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:03,719
did uh

838
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:06,060
uh another rainbow uh the triangle by

839
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,799
rainbow I wanted to make some I've been

840
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:11,460
real I started obsessing over the old

841
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,920
ogs like unhealthily like obsessing with

842
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,720
the old oh geez so I took a triangle by

843
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,220
rainbow and started hitting all my old

844
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:22,259
OG cuts and making uh regular seeds out

845
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:26,338
of those and a good like property

846
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,960
regular seed lines yeah and uh holy [ __ ]

847
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:29,639
um there are some OG's that are coming

848
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,400
out of there that you'll get to see that

849
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:34,379
are um it's like holy [ __ ] like you

850
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,900
actually did it you kind of brought OG

851
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:40,260
like like the oh geez I remember back

852
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,000
you know into into the yeah OG's ogs of

853
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:44,400
nowaday are very different than what we

854
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,079
remember the Dank old OG I mean like I

855
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,519
can think of a few different like

856
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,220
Expressions that I'm used to seeing in

857
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,780
ogs and anything past that I don't

858
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:53,939
really consider it OG because they

859
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,579
weren't the original expressions of it

860
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:59,579
you know nope dude I've got like that

861
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:02,220
old burnt rubber that old Akron [ __ ]

862
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:04,859
coming out of it you get that [ __ ] uh

863
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:07,318
lemon Pine sauce [ __ ] coming out of some

864
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:09,299
of them uh we've got some really nice

865
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,960
Expressions out of them

866
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:15,960
um once again I grow

867
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:19,019
I have always bred for myself yeah and

868
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,480
it just so happens that people like

869
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:23,039
the same kind of stuff some people like

870
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,619
the same kind of stuff I like you know

871
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,900
so some of the stuff I breed people like

872
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:29,760
um my flowers never are going to be your

873
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,220
biggest yield or in your room it's just

874
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,660
not what the [ __ ] I look for like you

875
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:36,118
know it's just something to pray for

876
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:37,759
yeah that's not what I breed for man I I

877
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,519
breed for

878
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,560
first I like uh flavors and that's why I

879
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,739
started obsessing over the OG I missed

880
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,779
the gas like I missed that gas

881
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:51,239
um I missed and people say gas but

882
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,920
they're so much more complexity to it

883
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,858
like we were just talking there's that

884
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:59,639
accurate like bile smell there's the

885
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:02,338
[ __ ] garlicky funky gym sock smells

886
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:04,019
it's just those bad smells you know I

887
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,239
started missing that [ __ ] like

888
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:07,079
everything was sweet now and everything

889
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,799
was

890
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:13,019
[ __ ] the same everything is the same

891
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,240
that's where we all end up everything

892
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:16,980
was [ __ ] purple punch I'm not

893
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,318
[ __ ] on purple punch when I say that

894
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,900
but everything started to look like

895
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:25,380
[ __ ] purple punch or cookies or

896
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,780
gelato and or and then gelato was like

897
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,140
ice cream cake and ice cream cake is

898
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,819
back to purple Bunch looking [ __ ] and

899
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:34,858
yeah and that's why when I brought up

900
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:37,199
wedding cake because it is one of the

901
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:39,480
newer ones that's all hey that's pretty

902
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,818
[ __ ] nice like yeah it's nice and

903
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,740
Piney and [ __ ] you know a lot a lot of

904
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,480
people still like um wedding cake

905
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:47,578
despite it being all hypey and in a lot

906
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,920
of stuff it still is a pretty good plant

907
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,300
despite all that I'm trying to find some

908
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,980
good questions for us while we're going

909
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,660
through here's here we go

910
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,280
here's a good question when was the

911
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:58,098
first time you remember seeing Urkel

912
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:02,640
smelly

913
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:04,619
[ __ ] Christ 99 I think 99-ish 99-ish

914
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,460
I think right around there

915
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:07,260
um

916
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,318
goddamn

917
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,740
it was definitely 90s

918
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:16,199
um let me I don't know

919
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:18,899
at the time it was actually called

920
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:19,980
Purple Urkel yeah at the time when I

921
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,318
started first seeing the purple

922
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,599
strengths yeah um but those purple

923
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,420
strains ended up becoming a lot of

924
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,760
different [ __ ] names yeah exactly

925
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,280
hands up so I started to first see in

926
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,960
those real purple strains in Northern

927
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,019
California

928
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,119
um in that 90s so everything that was

929
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:41,400
coming out was these big giant green

930
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:45,119
Spears and then all of a sudden these

931
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:48,960
little purple flowers in Jesus Christ it

932
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:51,000
like set the world Ablaze and um

933
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,400
and so that's

934
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,679
I grew a lot of Urkel

935
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,300
a lot a lot of [ __ ] Urkel but I'm an

936
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,879
allergic Circle so I'm not allowed to

937
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,500
grow it anymore

938
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,358
right the kid's allergic to it too

939
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,519
cheesy I remember you've seen it like

940
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,380
Turf beans like literally the terpenes

941
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,440
in the air like the pollen it produces

942
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:12,720
it rips me to shreds it makes my immune

943
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,818
system attacking myself so [ __ ] [ __ ]

944
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,078
that plant can't grow it no more and you

945
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:17,759
mentioned it you mentioned you have an

946
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,280
immune disorder too right like what do

947
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,200
you find that works best for that

948
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,200
um

949
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:28,858
[ __ ] water drinking lots of water

950
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:31,679
no we twice though like uh

951
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:34,858
the good combos of sativas that don't

952
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:36,000
get you jittery yeah but it still gets

953
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:38,880
you that

954
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,519
that motivation that you know like where

955
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,740
I can get up and move but you don't I

956
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,780
since I had afib to go with my

957
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:48,959
autoimmune disease and have had heart

958
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,819
surgery and been shocked [ __ ] so many

959
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,059
times back to life

960
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:56,159
um I cannot get elevated because yeah my

961
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:57,540
heart's been up in the 240s before and

962
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:58,920
they're all like you hitting the crack

963
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:02,039
pipe and I'm all actually I don't

964
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,019
suppose yeah I mean you know but uh I'm

965
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,558
going to die so you might want to

966
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:10,800
[ __ ] do something yeah

967
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:12,540
so the super sativas like and that's why

968
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,039
like I love to breed with them but I

969
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:16,259
have to be really careful when I first

970
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:18,179
breed with them so my first rounds after

971
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,680
I smoke them and stuff I usually will

972
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:22,139
take like one hit and just see where

973
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,299
it's at yeah and then if I don't get too

974
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:27,719
elevated I start to lean into it more

975
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:32,400
but that combination man and I do

976

00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:03,058
cats Marcus from yeah cult classic yeah

986
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:06,179

987
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:08,400
worked with it I enjoyed that cut

988
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:10,679
see what else we got here for you one of

989
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,960
the questions we got um and someone was

990
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:15,719
asking about I have to ask answer this

991
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,039
one right lock Blockhead by black sativa

992
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:19,379
so

993
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,599
the black sativa is an unknown [ __ ]

994
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:25,079
sativa the man who gave that to me is

995
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:28,200
past he uh died years ago

996
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:29,940
um he handed me some amazing strains so

997
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:32,699
if you have the blockhead by black

998
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,220
sativa with the rainbow and she's a

999
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:37,558
beaut like just know that that came from

1000
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:39,779
a special place I don't know what black

1001
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:43,079
sativa is I'm assuming it's China black

1002
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,220
or uh Vietnamese black or something like

1003
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,440
that

1004
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:48,118
um I called that [ __ ] Garbage barge

1005
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,338
because it literally smelled like raw

1006
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:53,280
the tree

1007
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:55,500
yeah yep so walkhead by black sativa is

1008
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,900
a special girl I love pot

1009
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,460
so I think that that I had to mention

1010
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,400
that [ __ ]

1011
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:04,858
okay what about when smelly ran into

1012
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,660
AFCO first

1013
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:10,440
do you have any experience with after we

1014
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:13,259
I do I I'm pretty sure Afric would never

1015
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,000
stay in veg for me

1016
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,819
she would just always pre-flower

1017
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,280
constantly and it pissed me off so I ran

1018
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:22,380
her for a little while and that was it

1019
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,980
wasn't one of the ones that like for me

1020
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:28,440
that I was working with religiously so I

1021
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,480
don't have a lot a lot of experience it

1022
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,780
was like the you were bringing up you

1023
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,260
had what was it the AK-47 yeah yeah I

1024
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:39,480
had an AK-47 after gooey cross that

1025
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,059
literally just flowered under 24 hours

1026
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,219
away but that sucks yeah I it was

1027
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:45,900
[ __ ] amazing but you constantly took

1028
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:48,539
clones clone clone clone yeah you can't

1029
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,760
get them in bed you can't keep it in veg

1030
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:53,279
so that was my experience with the AF

1031
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,160
GUI and it made me sad because it's a

1032
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,160
good [ __ ] plant and I just it wasn't

1033
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:01,920
made for my mom room I suppose

1034
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:04,019
yeah are we bottlenecking boys I don't I

1035
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,400
don't know that what that means I think

1036
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:07,199
people are confused about what

1037
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,559
bottlenecking means in cannabis but if

1038
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:13,259
you notice like you can uh

1039
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,700
cross things into each other try to make

1040
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,380
it a uniform line and it still can't

1041
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:17,879
happen in cannabis and if that can't

1042
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:20,640
happen how are you bottlenecking

1043
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,960
anything really I mean you can you can

1044
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,420
increase inbred traits and like

1045
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,519
blueberry without bottlenecking too yeah

1046
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:31,800
I think blueberry was

1047
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:35,280
so deep into its lineage I mean what 15

1048
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:37,380
20 times in like yeah I don't the one

1049
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,140
that I ended up with I have no money it

1050
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:42,358
has like they said that um so DJ was

1051
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:44,338
supposedly an F4 when they got it some

1052
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:45,900
dude worked it four generations another

1053
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:47,519
dude worked at another four generations

1054
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,900
and somehow kept the blueberry smell

1055
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:51,300
without looking anything like blueberry

1056
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,940
or having mutations it's an interesting

1057
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:58,099
one it's a really interesting one I did

1058
00:54:53,940 --> 00:55:01,740
uh rally fly fishing I did get uh some

1059
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:04,980
lots of uh different Kims from our

1060
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:08,098
friend in Santa Cruz oh okay yeah yeah

1061
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:11,579
and um I had a very uh was a variegation

1062
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:14,640
kind of a [ __ ] kid yeah yeah and then

1063
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:17,339
I had uh CIS yeah I think he had one

1064
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:22,500
labeled Kim says Kim 91 and then the the

1065
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:24,719
d uh I they're a good plants so all the

1066
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,119
KMD was a good plan I mean all of them

1067
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,578
were nice green like kind of [ __ ] I like

1068
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,579
to smoke so yeah no complaints for me

1069
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:35,400
like at all so I did finally and I

1070
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:37,380
worked with Kim a bit as well

1071
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,838
I I've never really been a chem person

1072
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:42,119
myself like that the chem 91 itself like

1073
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:44,039
I I don't like smoking it too much I

1074
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:45,660
think it's ugly I mean there's it

1075
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:47,579
doesn't look grow it really well like

1076
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:49,920
scumpie is a killer but I cannot make

1077
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:51,660
that plan look [ __ ] pretty I I

1078
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,940
actually did okay with it like I could

1079
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:55,259
make her look decent enough but no

1080
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,358
you're right I

1081
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:00,839
she doesn't find her way to the Garden

1082
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:03,358
as very often yeah because I do have

1083
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:05,338
these other OG cuts that I love somebody

1084
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,558
said something about a legend rainbow

1085
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:10,380
and I actually did that I did a legend

1086
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:14,280
OG by rainbow and one of the crosses

1087
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:15,539
recently uh did you like out of the OG's

1088
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,240
that you've crossed a rainbow which is

1089
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:21,019
your favorite the San Diego

1090
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:23,699
San Diego yeah for some reason

1091
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:25,199
triangle with rainbow it really brings a

1092
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:27,899
lot of triangle because you got triangle

1093
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:30,719
on in rainbow and and triangle there so

1094
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:34,318
you get a lot of OG but you this San

1095
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,239
Diego I once again I wish uh one of the

1096

1107
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,818

1108
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:02,219

1109
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:04,739

00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,920
especially with Crossing with it and

1131
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,140
seeing it I've seen like blue dream

1132
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,800
looking plants come out of that [ __ ]

1133
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:12,000
like it's a trip it might not be did you

1134
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,839
know where you sourced your Skittles cut

1135
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,099
at

1136
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:19,440
uh I got it from the okay so you know

1137
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:21,300
the guy I don't I'm just gonna say I'm

1138
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,460
not gonna say his name you actually know

1139
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,800
him he's from slow

1140
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,659
um San Luis Obispo okay uh he used to

1141
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,940
always be with Gage in them

1142
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:32,098
okay okay

1143
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:34,139
and he worked with the what are they

1144
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:36,180
called tur pogs or whatever the [ __ ]

1145
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:37,858
those dudes names are before Skittles

1146
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,318
became cool he was moving all their

1147
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:42,239
outdoor for him of the Stables [ __ ] was

1148
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:45,358
brown as [ __ ] but it had a good does

1149
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:48,239
yeah and uh I got it from him so

1150
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:50,239
Skittles is an ugly ass plant ugly as

1151
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:53,459
[ __ ] in flower it just I don't think

1152
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,899
well yeah even indoors it was [ __ ]

1153
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,019
wanted to be Brown

1154
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,818
but with rainbow rainbows like hey buddy

1155
00:58:58,019 --> 00:59:03,480
let's [ __ ] right let's do this thing

1156
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:05,699
right yeah yeah all right here's a did

1157
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,920
you guys down there run into the kind

1158
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:09,838
and yeah if there was a traceable back

1159
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,599
to DJ or Washington Growers I remember

1160
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,759
just kind bud yeah that's that's how I

1161
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:17,700
remember it like so

1162
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,680
um because yeah so what we were getting

1163
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:21,659
back then like coming out of hunt boat

1164
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,239
they would just call kind bud or green

1165
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:26,899
bud or

1166
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:30,000
Humboldt and [ __ ] like that um yeah but

1167
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:33,358
the kind bud was more like a term for

1168
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,179
like what is the new saw and exotic and

1169
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:39,179
[ __ ] like that's used now we used kind

1170
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:41,460
but in the 90s to describe you know good

1171
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:44,098
green Bud yeah yeah

1172
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,900
I still have seeds

1173
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:48,780
from those green buds that we were

1174
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:51,059
getting out of Humboldt in the 90s and

1175
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:53,880
it's literally on pieces of scratch

1176
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:57,180
paper and I have wrote it in pencil and

1177
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:00,240
it says Humboldt on it and then one

1178
00:59:57,179 --> 01:00:02,639
would say humble IBL and then you would

1179
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,338
say like Humboldt green I still have

1180
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:07,798
these seats I mean most of them are like

1181
01:00:04,338 --> 01:00:10,798
pale tan white [ __ ] that's been in the

1182
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:12,739
freezer now for 20 years but I kept them

1183
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:16,199
that's good

1184
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:20,298
I yeah I doubt I would uh I think we'd

1185
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:20,298
have to have them get actually uh

1186
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,980
and I don't even know if it would be

1187
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:29,339
worth it because

1188
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:31,079
so you would get pounds and as you go

1189
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:32,699
through the pounds at the bottom of the

1190
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,500
pounds you'd find a few seeds you know

1191
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:36,118
and when you were selling the pounds you

1192
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,039
didn't want the buyers to see the seeds

1193
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:39,900
so I'd pull the seeds out of all the

1194
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:42,058
pounds as they were coming down from up

1195
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,700
North and yeah so

1196
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:47,040
I grew a bunch of those up in uh when I

1197
01:00:44,699 --> 01:00:50,058
did the thousand pound grow a bunch of

1198
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,058
that was the Humboldt stuff

1199
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:57,420
that was the last time I smelled stuff

1200
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:59,219
that was the last time it makes sense

1201
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,780
um and we still have some of those seeds

1202
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:02,699
um so there's definitely

1203
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,260
gonna be some skunk sense in some of

1204
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:07,980
those seats and that's the only reason

1205
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:09,839
why I would consider like trying to

1206
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,880
I don't want to pop them because I don't

1207
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:14,338
think they would grow yeah you know what

1208
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,318
I'm saying like I don't think so but

1209
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:17,940
they're still like DNA inside yeah

1210
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:19,318
that's yeah I know what you mean it's

1211
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,760
disappointing like if they don't grow

1212
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:22,858
and then you wonder if you wasted that

1213
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,380
tissue for a potential DNA shipment or

1214
01:01:22,858 --> 01:01:27,779
down the line I told you I showed you

1215
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:30,059
the pictures of the stuff I had from my

1216
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,760
dad's prison yeah he was in prison and

1217
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:35,940
it was he sent me [ __ ] seeds because

1218
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,339
that's a weirdo and this [ __ ] little

1219
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:41,519
Correctional envelope and those seats

1220
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:43,739
were all like fossilized literally they

1221
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:46,318
were like crystallized on the inside oh

1222
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:49,019
yeah no I didn't [ __ ] seeds where but

1223
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:51,119
if he was sending them to me uh that was

1224
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:53,639
his let his last jail stint that wasn't

1225
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:57,480
like when I was a baby because later in

1226
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:58,920
life so I was like what the [ __ ] you

1227
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,559
know you're sending me seats of Jeff

1228
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,019
these must be special and then somehow

1229
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:06,119
they got put into a box and that box got

1230
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:09,358
put how did they end up with seats in

1231
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,940
jail who [ __ ] knows that guy I'm

1232
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,880
telling you man well supposedly I was

1233
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,740
conceived while he was in jail oh I

1234
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,960
could see that but my mom just got a

1235
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:21,358
cruise out there you know like hey

1236
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,579
what's up so we're gonna time to smash

1237
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:25,880
yeah we're gonna make the [ __ ] baby

1238
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:27,980
it's the 70s who cares

1239
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,480
ridiculous

1240
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,920
that's a good way to get that's a good

1241
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,900
way to know that you're special is when

1242
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,059
you're when your mama went to to jail to

1243
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,338
make babies yeah for you it would bring

1244
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:39,900
you into this world yeah so I'm like ah

1245
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:41,058
I heard you were conceived when you were

1246
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,858
in jail

1247
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:45,839
it's probably a good one

1248
01:02:43,858 --> 01:02:50,000
so someone's asking are those chocolate

1249
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:54,298
uh Thai seeds small medium or large

1250
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,659
well you I have some that are tiny tiny

1251
01:02:54,298 --> 01:03:01,259
ones and then I have also bred some that

1252
01:02:57,659 --> 01:03:04,139
are large yeah I think it really depends

1253
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:06,180
like the male sometimes the male lets

1254
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:07,679
the little seeds come out sometimes the

1255
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:09,779
weird thing with some of the Thai ones

1256
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:13,460
is you'll get these really big [ __ ]

1257
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:16,079
Airy weird seats like like almost white

1258
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,980
seeds in it but they're they're they

1259
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,680
grow

1260
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:21,719
like they they look pale oh they're

1261
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,480
dealing with it yeah but they still

1262
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:26,219
[ __ ] grow you know and it's I think a

1263
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,639
lot of it is because I don't want to let

1264
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:33,779
her go for 487 days to become black

1265
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:37,500
seeds yeah yeah no

1266
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:39,960
um I have some uh that are really tiny

1267
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:43,260
um one was the the was the the green

1268
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:46,079
does it green some green tie

1269
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:49,020
um but they call that one there was a

1270
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,180
green something tie that's really tiny

1271
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:54,559
the smallest seeds I've ever seen are

1272
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:57,598
those African seeds yeah

1273
01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:00,059
yeah the Ugandan seeds are like the size

1274
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,380
of a pinhead like they are like tiny

1275
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:04,200
like some of them are [ __ ] like

1276
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:06,358
little bitty black specks uh I've had

1277
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:08,578
some from the Mekong Delta

1278
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:09,779
um Delta 9 lab used to sell the the they

1279
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:10,980
were the meat Kong Haze he called them

1280
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,440
but there's no Haze in it but it was

1281
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,420
just a Cambodian land race that went 26

1282
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:19,318
weeks but they were tiny tiny tiny black

1283
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:22,079
yeah yeah tiny black as [ __ ] like black

1284
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:24,179
as yeah and they were tiny little shits

1285
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:27,960
but the Thai seats are weird like I've

1286
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:31,858
seen variations of the tie but uh once

1287

1309
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:31,679
finding the ties that the height that

1310
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,599
mushroom filling right yeah that took

1311
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:36,118
away all my pain but it scared never let

1312

let's just put that out there yeah a lot

1314
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:44,579
of [ __ ] LSD so having flashbacks from

1315
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:46,500
weed isn't fun like that's all what the

1316
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:48,599
[ __ ] is going on I started seeing

1317
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:51,659
submarine Sandwiches walking around on

1318
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:52,640

1323
01:06:01,338 --> 01:06:06,659
I I just like I like I know some people

1324
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,280
you know don't like the structure and

1325
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:10,440
don't like the stretch and those things

1326
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:13,019
but I like to take a plant put it in the

1327
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:15,720
flower and have her grow into you know a

1328
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:18,000
tree and as I flip I don't want to veg

1329
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:20,279
for two and three [ __ ] months like

1330
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,199
yeah I don't want to grow leaves the

1331
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,480
electricity in California is so [ __ ]

1332
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:26,879
expensive the least amount of time for

1333
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,159
growing leaves the better so yeah I like

1334
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,260
my plants to stretch like some people

1335
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:33,118
[ __ ] hate it but

1336
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:35,760
that's a warning when you buy things

1337
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,380
with rainbow you might find a mutant but

1338
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,760
you might find the most stretching plant

1339
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:42,358
you've ever seen in your [ __ ] life

1340
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,520

01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,440
[ __ ] place that was uncomfortable for

1448

1451
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:29,698
expanding my mind and now all of a

1452
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:31,979
sudden

1453
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:34,559
after years like my brain is going

1454
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:36,178

1611
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:26,039
middle of nowhere it was like I think

1612
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,440
yeah and we did like a little roundabout

1613
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:29,819
and it was like a dirt area yeah and a

1614
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:33,658
little parking lot

1615
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:37,219

1620
01:18:43,738 --> 01:18:48,119
big boy

1621
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:51,600
I went in and just asked the girl I saw

1622
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:53,399
will you do a bowl of beans and rice and

1623

right with a tortilla on the side

1629
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:06,779

[ __ ] man God that was a car full of

1637
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:26,519
[ __ ] morons we did a live we did a

1638
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:28,859
live we didn't do it like that was one

1639
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,780
of my first very first life feeds ever

1640
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:34,738
we did a [ __ ] live and I remember

1641
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:36,719
people are asking me questions on why I

1642
01:19:34,738 --> 01:19:39,299
used

1643
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:41,640
aloe or something when I was cloning and

1644
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,260
I was I was yeah and I was just like I

1645
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:46,199
thought it was always obvious like it's

1646
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:48,000
free cloning gel you know like like I

1647
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:49,460
was like because I'm a cheap ass like

1648
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,859
yeah

1649
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:54,539
it [ __ ] works yeah yeah I remember

1650
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:56,939
that that was one of the questions that

1651
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:58,619
stick out for some reason yeah that was

1652
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:00,839
the one of the first I think I started

1653
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:02,579
doing live feeds a week before that to

1654
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,600
build up to the emerald cup because I

1655
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:04,679
was gonna be bringing a bunch of seeds

1656
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,659
and I was like Hey we're gonna be there

1657
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:08,460
blah blah blah and then on the way there

1658
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:09,960
was probably my second or third ever

1659
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,880
live stream

1660
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,800
and then now it just never stopped and

1661
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,699

1700
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,658

um I still can smoke Blue Dream though

1703
01:22:02,819 --> 01:22:08,698
and blue dream has some Haze I yeah it

1704
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,380
has in it it was coming out of the same

1705
01:22:08,698 --> 01:22:13,019
area that the Hayes brothers were

1706
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:14,880
working in and they call it Santa Cruz

1707
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:17,340
Hayes Santa Cruz Hayes had the Hayes

1708
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,319
Brothers Hayes so I I'm not saying that

1709
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:22,020
that's the haze that they use but for

1710
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:24,299
blue dream to be so [ __ ] special I

1711
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,280
would bet a dollar

1712
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:27,960
yeah there was there's definitely some

1713
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:31,619
Haze in it I mean it was a super silver

1714
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,880
haze I Believe by uh Kentucky

1715
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:34,140
I can't remember the name of the company

1716
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,940
that originally made the super silver

1717
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:37,980
haze DJ shorts it'll be very cross it

1718
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:40,319
was used but yeah yeah it was something

1719
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:43,500
so I still like that one and see that's

1720
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:45,299
where I like I like that I like that uh

1721
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,640
mixture because I can smell blue dream

1722
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:48,960
and not get the Jitters you know I think

1723
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,820
it's because of the blueberry in it it

1724
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,939
just makes everything so anti-anxiety

1725
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:56,340
that's I love it I love blueberry like

1726
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:58,139
by itself like I love to smoke old

1727
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:00,060
blueberry that tastes like blueberry and

1728
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:02,219
it doesn't get super high that's why I

1729
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:04,440
like growing Calio too there's probably

1730
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:07,079
nine percent THC in that [ __ ] plant

1731
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:08,279
right and I love smoking the [ __ ] out of

1732
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:12,238
it because I can smoke a whole joint

1733
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:15,738
though I need to go do [ __ ] yeah right

1760
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:23,880
an area and it's a few miles away I

1761
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:26,219
equate that with weed or burning weed I

1762
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,800
love skunk yeah I like the smell of it

1763
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:32,340
as a matter of fact I had a homie send

1764
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,380
me some skunk tincture here today and I

1765
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:36,619
opened it in the house and bring dad and

1766
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:40,260
I was like

1767
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:42,238
oh my god dude my dad had a pet skunk

1768
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,880
when he was a kid they took the bag out

1769
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:46,979
that [ __ ] grew its back back and

1770
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,420
sprayed him in his [ __ ] face I see

1771
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:50,339
another one of my friends right there

1772
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:53,460
Taylor Graham

1773
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:56,159
um Taylor oh god um

1774
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:59,340
throw techniques man I

1775
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:03,679
I think you and I have had that uh

1776
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:03,679
uh drying and curing

1777
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:08,520
um yeah so

1778
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:11,579
I drying and curing I like the first few

1779
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:14,400
the first day or two I like to get a

1780
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:17,399
a large amount of moisture out

1781
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:19,439
uh I wouldn't want to say quickly a God

1782
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:21,420
it's so hard for me to say this because

1783
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:23,939
people might take it wrong and say oh

1784
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:26,399
it's gonna be weird so

1785
01:25:23,939 --> 01:25:28,379
I leave all my leaves on the big water

1786
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:30,839
leaves I take off all Bud leaves stay on

1787
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:32,460
everything like that so with that was

1788
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,920
saying that it's holding a lot of

1789
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:37,260
moisture so I get a lot of air movement

1790
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:39,600
in the room but not on the plants

1791
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:41,579
there's just a lot of air movement and

1792
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,039
then I have a lot of air coming out and

1793
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:46,260
getting clean and coming in we're

1794
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:47,698
constantly flipping the humidity around

1795
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:49,739
and out

1796
01:25:47,698 --> 01:25:52,439
those first few days are really really

1797
01:25:49,738 --> 01:25:54,718
important because if you let it stay wet

1798
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:57,238
too long you're going to lose some of

1799
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:58,739
that crispness in my opinion you're

1800
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:02,399
going to lose some of that crispness to

1801
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:04,678
the terpenes so I get a quicker like dry

1802
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:07,679
at the beginning and then I slow that

1803
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:10,440
[ __ ] down I then I pick it back

1804
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:12,779
up so it's so weird I don't do this

1805
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:15,479
classic keep it one percentage across

1806
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:18,179
the board yeah I literally am in and out

1807
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:20,759
of my dry rooms checking them [ __ ]

1808
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:23,940
multiple times a day that kind of stuff

1809
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:26,219
I will raise humidity lower humidity so

1810
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:29,579
for me like I am probably one of the

1811
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:31,639
worst people to learn to grow from

1812
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:31,639
um

1813
01:26:32,779 --> 01:26:38,579
it's all in my brain that I'm constantly

1814
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:40,440
[ __ ] doing even when I'm feeding

1815
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:42,359
plants like I go and check the plants

1816
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:43,738
and like okay this is where I am this is

1817
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:46,079
what I do

1818
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:47,939
um this is so it's like when I leave and

1819
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,519
Petey has to come and [ __ ] help oh

1820
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:54,238
God everything gets ruined I'm sorry I

1821
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:55,980
mean yeah yeah I now do not go any like

1822
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,439
Vacations or anything while I'm growing

1823
01:26:55,979 --> 01:27:00,119
unless I can fill my reservoirs and be

1824
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:02,879
back before they're empty and he just

1825
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:05,880
Waters and stuff like that but

1826
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,739
be anal about it constantly check them

1827
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,900
fill your butts put your hands on it

1828
01:27:07,738 --> 01:27:12,658
smell them see where it is you want that

1829
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:15,059
crispness you know yeah I like I like

1830
01:27:12,658 --> 01:27:16,679
how your buds dry and how they keep some

1831
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:19,380
of the moisture content but it's not

1832
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:21,239
it's not like you don't get black ash or

1833
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:23,520
anything crazy yeah it's just sticky

1834
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:25,559
still yeah it's clean it's got it down

1835
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,560
it's some of the best I've ever smoked

1836
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:31,980
him in pig sweet are my two tops I

1837
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:35,580
appreciate that uh the chirps Fernando

1838
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:38,279
the chirps on Rainbow I can't I get

1839
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:42,179

1840
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:44,460
rainbow like it's like a tiny funky I

1841
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:46,800
get like I compare the chips on the the

1842
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:51,600
rainbow clone the actual rainbow clone

1843
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:53,600
to a very terpy OG with some doughy

1844
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,579
notes yeah

1845
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,460
it smells almost like sourdough bread

1846
01:27:56,579 --> 01:28:02,460
with OG like this it's like a [ __ ]

1847
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:04,980
sourdough starter like the other one my

1848
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:06,779
favorite kind is the chocolate one and

1849
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:08,218
that was Brent's favorite that's the one

1850
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:09,899
she loved and I liked it because it had

1851
01:28:08,219 --> 01:28:12,060
more of an anti-anxiety eye kind of like

1852

1855
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:21,840
on this uh release is the the films and

1856
01:28:19,738 --> 01:28:25,859
the reason I'm gonna do the the Femmes

1857
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:28,679
is uh I've grown hundreds of them and I

1858
01:28:25,859 --> 01:28:30,658
am uh really proud of them they're

1859
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:33,300
they're really kicking out a lot of

1860
01:28:30,658 --> 01:28:34,979
really nice stuff uh the rainbow cyst

1861
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,800

1862
01:28:34,979 --> 01:28:39,119
uh a lot of nice crosses okay I got a

1863
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,360
cramp in my bucket Lake reading all

1864
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:41,359
those numbers

1865
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,020
but

1866
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:48,300
but you already won you scarecrow's

1867

already won one the first one right okay

1868
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:52,560
scarecrow's already won one

1869
01:28:51,779 --> 01:28:54,179
um

1870
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,159
the flowering times on the chocolate

1871
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:58,260
cherry Thai that was what was funny is

1872
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:00,719
the Rev had got that's why I questioned

1873
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:02,460
the cherry on the Cherry tie yeah uh

1874
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,920
because the rabbit got it under 70

1875
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:07,619
[ __ ] days like no [ __ ] like his whole

1876
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,960
goal was to shorten it and the Rev went

1877
01:29:07,619 --> 01:29:12,059
hard on that project yeah

1878
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:15,000
um that chocolate cherry though that

1879
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:18,000
made me go crazy legs uh Rowdy uh I grew

1880
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:22,619
it Outdoors into November

1881
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:24,899
and um it was I think uh 18 feet tall or

1882
01:29:22,619 --> 01:29:28,500
so it was as high as the [ __ ] barn

1883
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:31,819
and the barn was uh two stories I should

1884
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,819
have never smoked that marijuana

1885
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:37,980
marijuana I'll tell you yeah but it did

1886
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:40,500
put me I do have some blue dream crosses

1887
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:42,539
I do have some TK crosses uh with the

1888
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:45,539
with the they're going to be femps it

1889
01:29:42,539 --> 01:29:47,639
will be blue dream by Rainbow Six TK by

1890
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:51,719
rainbow sis

1891
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:54,659
um there is the SD by rainbow sis there

1892
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:57,840
is actually the I know this one's gonna

1893
01:29:54,658 --> 01:30:00,238
uh but it actually bred so well the 70

1894
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,340
London pound cake 75. I did that one

1895
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:04,559
pretty well it [ __ ] bred really well

1896
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:06,779
with rainbow all I did was Lin's flavor

1897
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:09,380
it's all in yeah like a lot of lemon or

1898
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:12,658
yeah yeah and um

1899
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:16,079
uh my favorite OG

1900
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:19,559
is called I've been I've called it the

1901
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:22,859
San Diego cut or the San Diego OG that

1902
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:25,199
is my favorite OG I don't really know

1903
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:28,139
exactly what this and like they said uh

1904
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:30,359
Alex said triangle I believe that San

1905
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:32,760
Diego and triangle are the same [ __ ]

1906
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:35,399
plant it could be that we're in two

1907
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:38,219
different people's gross yeah and I

1908
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:41,638
acquired both of those cuts but had been

1909
01:30:38,219 --> 01:30:44,279
on two different paths like person a

1910
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:46,560
kept really good care of their cut and

1911
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:49,319
person B might not have taken as good

1912
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:51,679
care of his cut yeah and that one time

1913
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:54,299
that that plant had a little regression

1914
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:58,380
changed the plant just a little bit so

1915
01:30:54,300 --> 01:31:00,659
triangle San Diego [ __ ] man I on a

1916
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,760
deserted island I could only have one I

1917
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:04,439
don't I don't know I I don't know it'd

1918

came to my daughter's birthday and were

2082

2087
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:20,760
control what people uh I was [ __ ] I

2088
01:38:19,079 --> 01:38:23,158

2089
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,020
that's too much money yeah literally

2090
01:38:23,158 --> 01:38:26,759
that's like I have to send this person

2091
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:29,400
all of my seeds because they're spending

2092
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,199
this much I did I literally they won

2093
01:38:29,399 --> 01:38:33,238
like a pack of seeds in the auction I

2094
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:35,698
sent them like four packs because that's

2095
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:37,919
too much [ __ ] money and then they

2096
01:38:35,698 --> 01:38:39,779
that happened like 10 times like yeah we

2097
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,840
did like 10 auctions I was expecting

2099
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:46,440

and three thousand [ __ ] dollars and I

2101

freaked out like I was on no like it's

2102
01:38:48,899 --> 01:38:54,059
not worth it so

2103
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:56,340
look okay so and they that

2104
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:59,820
really got them mad

2105
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:03,000
and then one of uh one of you guys who

2106
01:38:59,819 --> 01:39:05,399

2108
01:39:05,399 --> 01:39:12,238
said about me yeah uh behind my back and

2109
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:14,460

about afghoui I'm all like I don't know

2128
01:39:50,939 --> 01:39:55,319

2129
01:39:53,698 --> 01:39:57,119
time I ever had a ditch [ __ ] flowered

and veg like I couldn't grow it well

2131
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:03,960
like I sucked it growing after it so

2132

like uh yeah so right but that's I

2133

wanted to give that little bit there's

2134
01:40:05,698 --> 01:40:09,119
so much more to it but that's about it

2135
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,840
that I'll say unless somebody wants you

2136
