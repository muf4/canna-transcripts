00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,830
walker because I think that's someone

53
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,210
people want to know about my dog walker

54
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,830
didn't even sell that well so I think

55
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,840
most people are referring to your dog

56
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,840
walker which I feel is superior to mine

57
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,979

66

111
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:20,909
is that what people um so in like Oh 405

112
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:23,069
I was on cannabis world and I got the

113
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,600
green Bubba the purple Bubba both from

114
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:31,079
Ken organ kid and then I had sha bud who

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,129
is 707 seed bank his bubba kush cut they

116
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:39,800
were all called bubba ken called the

117
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:42,269
purple phyno which was supposedly an s-1

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,689
that some club owner and the in the

119
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:47,789
valley made it was really heavy yielding

120
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:49,920
made like Club tight nuggets with a

121
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:56,550
rounded top yeah

122
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,439
the katsu cut I as far as I know and I

123
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,939
can't remember specifically but I'm

124
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,250
pretty sure that was the cut that he

125
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:06,060
sold to katsu right and that was the

126
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:13,350
green Fino and then Shaba aka 707 seed

127
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:15,000
bank his uh his Bubba cut was the pre 98

128
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,250
and so basically what happened is I had

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,899
all three cuts I need to label them in

130
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,899
my rooms that I would could tell the

131
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,609
difference or you know so I could

132
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:26,399
maintain mothers and know which was

133
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:30,810
which and it just got the name pre 98

134
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:34,319
because sha had received the cutting in

135
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,180
the in the winter of 97 98 so at the

136
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,788
time it's like 2003

137
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,590
well it had to have been before 1998

138
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:43,860
because someone popped the seeds and has

139
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:46,709
a clone by now already pre 98 right

140
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,740
that's how I got the name exam um and

141
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,569
that was like 2004 and then it was like

142
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,030
three or four years later thats were

143
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:59,159
basically appropriated the name for

144
00:07:54,029 --> 00:08:00,750
selling seeds yeah so that's pretty much

145
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,939
all there is to it it wasn't anything

146
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,620
special it wasn't there weren't anything

147
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:08,250
crazy about it what was the difference

148
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,110
between Shahs and like the katsu they

149
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,240
all pretty much smell the same the

150
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,919
purple was like a little bit more purple

151
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,918
smelling but still the Bubba with the

152
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,250
incense and the like the smell in the

153
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,598
air

154
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:24,120
the same meaty smell the katsu they

155
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,459
would all turn purple depending on how

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,050
you grew them right so they're all

157
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,799
phenotypically variable based on

158
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:35,668
environment it was the green fee know

159
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,620
was that the katsu which it would just

160
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:39,418
tended to be green more often but if you

161
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,269
over furred it didn't budget very big

162
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,860
whatever it put out little tiny buds it

163
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:46,799
turned purple at the end of flower with

164
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,620
cold temperatures no not a major

165
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,199
difference the pre 98 tended to be a

166
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,730
little chunkier more often but still the

167
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:59,610
same characteristics as the other two

168
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:02,250
cuts it would still like basically what

169
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,110
I call like big stems small bud yeah

170
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,629
yeah right where you've given it too

171
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,850
much cal-mag or it doesn't have a big

172
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:12,299
enough root system for the size of pot

173
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,620
it's in whatever right if you vet it

174
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,028
looks just like most Bubba's if you veg

175
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,879
amount really big they'll start actually

176
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:19,139
producing pretty good that's [ __ ]

177
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,730
awesome dude that was a lot of [ __ ] I

178
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,708
didn't even know about Bubba glad you

179
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,930
said that people were asking about the

180
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,609
faceoff story that would be [ __ ]

181
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:30,299
awesome to hear like straight from the

182
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,000
mouth so the real og Cushman the source

183
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:37,620
genetics Chris Chris used to live up

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,778
here in Seattle in 2000 and I think he

185
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:45,480
lived up here from like Oh to 206

186
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:47,399
I met him in like Oh four and he was

187
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,830
growing the poison OG at the time which

188
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,929
was his bad seed Fino

189
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,360
from bags that he had purchased in SoCal

190
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:57,209
the face off whereas no I think he had

191
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,550
12 seeds of face off bag seeds the face

192
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,740
off was never actually a clone that was

193
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:04,709
being grown it was just a moniker given

194
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,810
to a certain batch of OG that went

195
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,470
through the Inland Empire back in like

196
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:12,359
99 or something like that I got six of

197
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,279
the seeds I think four or five of them

198
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,560
popped if I remember right the face off

199
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:22,589
number four is the cutting that I have

200
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:25,139
right I popped it from seed so that's

201
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,670
the only real face off really I mean I

202
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,519
think there's like four or five more

203
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:31,289
seeds out there Chris gave some to cult

204
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,449
classic seeds but I don't think he ever

205
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:36,449
popped them and I'd be surprised if they

206
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:40,620
even popped now 20 years old

207
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:42,450
ya know and I think Chris might have a

208
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,659
couple more seeds of it but that's about

209
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,850
it

210
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:46,769
that's pretty awesome so like so I I

211
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,570
popped the seeds it was the number four

212
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:52,529
Fino the number one two and three the

213
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:54,660
number one was like a it like the leaves

214
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:56,759
turned purple it had more of like a in

215
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:59,610
between bubba and and face off kind of

216
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:03,389
smell the number two was like this

217
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,950
really short sativa leaf looking thing

218
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,569
but it didn't stretch it all it was

219
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,870
almost like a dwarf plant but it had

220
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:13,170
really really thin blades the number-3

221
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,570
produced like much larger bigger colas

222
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:17,129
was a little bit hermie which was one of

223
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,600
the main reasons I didn't keep it and

224
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:20,399
it'll pretty much smelled like your

225
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,250
typical OG made with like a little bit

226
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,009
of a gummy bear funk and then the number

227
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,259
four in that the number three in the

228
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:30,899
number one kind of had that similar like

229
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,149
gummy bear in between OG and Bubba kind

230
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,699
of smell the number three was more og

231
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,559
Tom the number one was like it wasn't

232
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,940
really Bubba Dom I would say but it was

233
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:44,789
just kind of I would call it blander but

234
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:48,230
you know it wasn't anything particularly

235
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:52,799
special and then the number four was um

236
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:54,450
the it may it's that it's that face off

237
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,120
smell like that really long lasting

238
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:00,780
lingering after flavor and a real cushy

239
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,299
flavor and the main reason I kept it too

240
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,250
was its potency it's always potent like

241
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:06,569
first time I was smoking it I rolled up

242
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,519
a joint was driving to town he could

243
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,589
pick up some hydro gear this is like

244
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,028
2006 and I smoked that I start getting

245
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:13,830
like lightheaded in the car and I was

246
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:16,289
like alright this thing's pretty potent

247
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:20,278
probably and anybody that knows me knows

248
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:23,129
I smoke a lot of herbs so I don't even

249
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:26,070
comment on potency at all because I'm

250
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:28,379
smoking 20 or 50 different strains yeah

251
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,028
a day you know between all the different

252
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:47,250
kinds of hashes and whatever else

253
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:48,809
so Jason Kings cannibal dude the one

254
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:54,269
clone that I don't know that I don't

255
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:57,509
want yeah it's it's super hard to work

256
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:58,709
with I mean it's um it's a really old

257
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,289
strain from up here in the northwest

258
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:04,979
everybody that like if you're around in

259
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:07,469
the late 80s 90s and 2000 2000 smoking

260
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,959
weed up here you bought purple weed and

261
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:15,570
it smelled like the purple indica it's

262
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:17,549
like that's really um really hunt not it

263
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,170
well it's not I mean it's pungent but

264
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:21,179
it's like if you could think of what the

265
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:24,000
purp what purple smells like in color

266
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:27,479
this is everything that purple smells

267
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:34,919
like and hold on it's think I'm going to

268
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:37,320
take a toke in that night and I got the

269
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,958
cuttin in 2003 it was the very first cut

270
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,970
that I got basically yeah it didn't come

271
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,639
with a name either so I got it from my

272
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:48,860
friend who had gotten a medical card at

273
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,860
the time which was pretty hard to get

274
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:57,149
and he had gotten the cut from some

275
00:13:52,948 --> 00:14:00,479
organ growers I had no idea what it was

276
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:02,070
I was growing some 97 Dutch passion

277
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,209
blueberry seeds at the time and I also

278
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,550
had some some other blueberry seeds I

279
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:10,169
can't remember what they were

280
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:12,750
I think they're from Canada one of the

281
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:15,899
Canadian blueberry crosses like yeah one

282
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,590
of those you know I can't think of the

283
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,629
company

284
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,840
but you know [ __ ] out a canvas culture

285
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,840
Maggie

286
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:28,080
not like BCC Depot but like Federation

287
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,519
seeds all those guys I can't remember

288
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,070
who it was that had like the blueberry

289
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,319
the blueberry nl5 all that kind of stuff

290
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,750
I remember those do you ever try peach

291
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,200
seeds I do remember peak but I think

292
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:44,460
this was before Peaks um I think this

293
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:49,470
was a god I can't remember the name but

294
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,450
it'll come to me at second but basically

295
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,170
I was growing blueberry at the time and

296
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:57,930
when you cut up clones of the purple

297
00:14:55,169 --> 00:15:00,659
indica it literally smells like berries

298
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,129
kind of write out a very berry ish smell

299
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:07,409
right from the beginning which is kind

300
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:10,409
of that purple smell too and so I was I

301
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:12,360
didn't know what it was right I just I

302
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,679
just knew that like it kind of looked

303
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,060
like the blueberry [ __ ] so I kind of

304
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,949
like what's calling a blueberry for a

305
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,119
second I hadn't even floured it yet so I

306
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,610
didn't even know I was just like I don't

307
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,740
know blueberry something or other by the

308
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,570
time I finished the cut I knew that it

309
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,860
was one of the purple strains from up

310
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:32,250
here so we had the u-dub purp seattle

311
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:36,870
perps tacoma perps ultra violet these

312
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:39,409
were all basically the same fee knows or

313
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,879
not the same fee knows they were either

314
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:44,159
variations of the same variety or

315
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,710
hybrids of the same variety right which

316
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,209
was basically the old purple from up

317
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,370
here and it was like pretty widespread

318
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:54,660
and we knew that there was multiple

319
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:57,360
different cuts because you could um you

320
00:15:54,659 --> 00:16:00,360
could basically like when you bought

321
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,430
pounds of it you'd get some bags it all

322
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,459
smelled like the purple indica or like

323
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:06,838
ultra violet or whatever but if you got

324
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,299
the perps like from Tacoma

325
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,730
it'd have like big 20 gram colas in it

326
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,319
right and whenever you grew like or

327
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,560
whatever you saw like ultra violet

328
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,000
nuggets they didn't never have big

329
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,159
nuggets and it was always small little

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,339
ounce bags of [ __ ] yeah and when I grew

331
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:28,620
out the blueberry or the unknown cut

332
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:30,300
yeah mikhyl II I start I grew it a few

333
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,220
times and I was like there's no way that

334
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,259
this is the Tacoma perk cutting I don't

335
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,940
know if it's the ultraviolet I don't

336
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,590
know if it's the u-dub purp I don't

337
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,140
really know what cut it is because I

338
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,639
don't have anything to reference it by

339
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:43,949
in terms of other cuts so I called it

340
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,139
purple indica yeah that was how I got

341
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:51,990
its name right I got so it became p.i

342
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:53,490
right and basically you know that would

343
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,370
there never really was a purple in the

344
00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:00,779
cup here as far as I know it was just

345
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:02,909
the purse so and it's just a really

346
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,099
really tight it's not tiny it's not like

347
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:07,349
a dwarf or anything but it's a very

348
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:10,769
tight internode yeah um

349
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:12,659
Afghani plant pretty much anybody I know

350
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:14,730
that's twice my age that's up here in

351
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:20,640
Washington they immediately can identify

352
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:22,559
it as the old purp from up here kindness

353
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,840
cannabis he's one of my buddies from

354
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,250
back in the day he remembers it really

355
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:33,659
well too and that's what the P I was and

356
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:35,549
it's it's lower potency that you know 15

357
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,860
to 18 percent and pretty much whatever

358
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:42,210
you cross it to it reduces its potency

359
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:44,579
okay so [ __ ] plant though yeah and

360
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:50,430
it's just hard to work with from from

361
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:54,000
the perspective of trying to trying to

362
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:57,390
bring a new variety up to modern day

363
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,099
standards it's you know it's sometimes

364
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,930
you cross stuff in and it like like

365
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:02,429
cookies for example you cross it into

366
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,019
stuff that makes it really frosty at

367
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,180
purple which is what the market likes

368
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:10,740
yeah you crossed the pie and it makes it

369
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,630
less frosty dark purple and not quite as

370
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,740
potent but the funny thing is the

371
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:20,820
potency is um is so subjective yeah

372
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,410
nowadays that like back then the purple

373
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:24,450
indigo we always called it shut up weed

374
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,370
because anybody load a bomb toke or

375
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,710
whatever for they'd immediately just sit

376
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:31,739
there and zone out so even though it

377
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,559
always tests significantly was lower in

378
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,859
potency there a lot of stuff it um it

379
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,099
definitely would bring some people's

380
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,099
bells

381
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:48,330
these lower potency strains are coming

382
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:50,939
around more now since since concentrates

383
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:53,129
are much more in use and available it

384
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,549
seems like they've got a renewed life in

385
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,110
them yeah a little bit but I mean you

386
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:02,639
know lower potency means lower yields

387
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:05,279
yes as well right so I think a lot of

388
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,750
people are just trying to get as much

389
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,230
bang for their buck especially from an

390
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,519
economic perspective oh sure sure so

391
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,779
what are you working on now I think

392
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,250
that's what a lot of people like to know

393
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,170

394
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,480

just gonna I'm gonna go back to the

404
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:44,909
drawing board I'm tired of this [ __ ] I'm

405
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,500

something new not remaking [ __ ] just

414
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,900
because people are asking for it so it's

415
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,399
all personal preference you know and

416

424
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,430

kb he's like a type for her me that

426
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,150
thing hermes every which way you can

427
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:35,159
possibly get so hybridizing into it

428
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,170
you've gotta at least search through the

429
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,570
population and look for lower instances

430
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,190
of those traits yeah in anybody that's

431
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,779
not or even doesn't even know about that

432
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,940
obviously doesn't even probably grow

433
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:49,139
their own [ __ ] seeds so yeah

434
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,039
everybody's gonna be [ __ ] bombing you

435
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,790
about slurring

436
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:55,710
your story you wanted i'm een dude

437
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:59,269
i saw i can't make purple

438
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:03,149
cross with Osito - I don't get it

439
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:06,329
especially if it's uh you're lying in

440
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:09,719
the thing right well I mean exactly and

441
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:12,298
it's like well you know if if people are

442
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,220
mad about the name or whatever the the

443
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:17,308
funniest [ __ ] is they're the ones

444
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,710
complaining about patents on plants but

445
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:22,619
want trademark rights for naming [ __ ]

446
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,000
yeah it's you know you can't you can't

447
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:25,829
have your cake and eat it too you got to

448
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,278
be one or the other because that's how

449
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:32,069
patents and trademarks work it's not

450
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:35,220
it's I mean you know I think hypocrisy

451
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:37,109
is the a lot of people's motives so

452
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,179
whatever it's fine I mean mis-education

453
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:41,009
leads to it and it's it's all right so

454
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:43,679
what the world is nowadays yeah that's

455
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:45,538
very true what else you guys got for him

456
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,830
any other questions that are [ __ ] you

457
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:50,970
got him sitting here

458
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:52,470
don't ask [ __ ] lame ass [ __ ] yeah who

459
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,079
wants to talk about purple punch anyway

460
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,509
exactly seriously let's talk about some

461
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,990
[ __ ] historical [ __ ] let's talk you

462
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:01,500
know what yeah

463
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,390
HP 13 the most common misinformation

464
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,710
about it is that it's g13 hash plan I

465
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,210
think most people think that because

466
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,190
they're [ __ ] retards and haven't

467
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,380
looked up anything can you tell us about

468
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,590
appearance with HP 13 it's not something

469
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,929
many people talk about so I got the cut

470
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:18,599
I think from Caleb I think he was the

471
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:21,870
one that got it first but I had seen it

472
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,250
earlier for example like in you're

473
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:25,859
talking about Jason Kings cannibal

474
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:30,058
earlier so the can of Bible entry that

475
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:32,009
was my herb the Trinity crossed with you

476
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:37,589
dub that was herb that I had purchased

477
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:42,148
that I showed to Jason King at the 2002

478
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:45,298
Seattle Hempfest the [ __ ] that's in

479
00:22:42,148 --> 00:22:47,038
there that was us not the humble outdoor

480
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:49,200
pictures but the pictures of the indoor

481
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,629
that was my buddy cannabis Reverend yeah

482
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,528
through another glassblower friend of

483
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:57,659
ours that grew it that was the dog [ __ ]

484
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:59,640
entry that was in there

485
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,820
the purple indica entry that was mine

486
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,350
and then Scott reach also reached out to

487
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:06,058
Jason King and I think showed him

488
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,980
pictures of it but that cut came for me

489
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:16,339
I gave Scott that back in the

490
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:18,500
and so the first time I saw HP 13 was in

491
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:21,439
2004 I went to stay with a friend of

492
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,240
mine in Hana right and he's he was a

493
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,759
dude another dude that was on cannabis

494
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:31,160
world and um he he invited me to come

495
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,750
out to this party right now I won't tell

496
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,220
too much about the party even though

497
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,109
they don't throw it anymore but it was

498
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,700
basically a weed gathering party another

499
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:39,798
another couple buddies of mine that

500
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,390
currently live on Maui and it was

501
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:44,808
basically like it was deep in the

502
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,610
[ __ ] jungle it was um off grid so

503
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:48,139
there's there's no I mean they had power

504
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:49,939
because it's like a multimillionaires

505
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,280
home that was this thing getting thrown

506
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,750
at so they had refrigerators and all the

507
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:57,139
knives but was actually an off-grid home

508
00:23:53,750 --> 00:24:00,169
and you know they had like Cavalli

509
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:03,740
blunts and [ __ ] homemade kombucha and

510
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:07,820
like homemade beer and all kinds of [ __ ]

511
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:09,319
and Jason King also happened to be there

512
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:14,079
that was the first time I saw him endo

513
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:20,808
perps also that was like 2004 I believe

514
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:21,649
yeah it's 2004 and so HB 13 I'd heard

515
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:23,599
about it

516
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,600
everybody had talked about it I saw some

517
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,519
jungle grown HB 13 that was grown deep

518
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,769
in the jungle there and I thought it was

519
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,200
swag it was like but it was just poorly

520
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:36,079
ground I thought it had a really unique

521
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,960
smell but it had like no stickiness to

522
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,909
the resin the smell I had to really mash

523
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,970
it up because it was that outdoor [ __ ]

524
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:46,640
yeah and um but you could tell it had

525
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,370
like a unique smell to it and then I

526
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,919
eventually got the cut from CSI Humboldt

527
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:54,139
and I think that was probably around two

528
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:59,090
thousand seven or eight was the first

529
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:01,520
time I got it from him and it's it was

530
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:05,480
like it's a weird plant you know it's

531
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:08,058
it's pretty leafy very columnar growth

532
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,370
she like goes straight up didn't branch

533
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:12,529
very much small yield and definitely her

534
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:16,369
meat on the bottoms and that's where

535
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:20,000
like the PR the the [ __ ] what do they

536
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:22,699
call it the the sour P which is a Sour

537
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,710
Diesel HB 13

538
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,740
that was all the same group of cats that

539
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:31,579
did this Maui party um every year back

540
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:33,079
then and I still have some friends from

541
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:35,210
those parties that that live all over

542
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,470
and you know they they remember the

543
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,240
stuff one of the one of the most

544
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:42,920
impressive examples that I remembered

545
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:46,250
was the Jasmine Jack which came out of

546
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:49,880
Eugene and that was it was real hazy

547
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,589
smelling but at the time like in Seattle

548
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,810
hazy stuff was like where it was that

549
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:56,329
that's why the dog ship malawi Northern

550
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:58,940
Lights haze that I made and no haze f2s

551
00:25:56,329 --> 00:26:03,589
the pure Malawi gold that we had the

552
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,720
super bill all that [ __ ] was um was

553
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:07,849
super that was like what was popular

554
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,490
like I remember when I first got a G up

555
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:12,169
here from Chris nobody even gave a [ __ ]

556
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,759
people are like dude whatever that's

557
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,650
just some indica [ __ ] whatever yes

558
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,329
right they didn't even care

559
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,370
couldn't yet get anything more for it

560
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:22,069
nobody really even it was it was

561
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:24,409
pointless yeah I just was growing it

562
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:26,839
because I liked it right it wasn't you

563
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,210
know like a no three oh four oh five oh

564
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:34,429
gee wasn't really that popular or known

565
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:36,799
outside of Los Angeles yeah that's so

566
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,960
dude I can't ever get anybody

567
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,879
knowledgeable to contact to come in on

568
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,170
HP 13 and it seems like everybody who

569
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,700
grows it or is grown it has different

570
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,070
opinions on whether it's worth keeping

571
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,690
whether it's worth growing but that's

572
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,960
pretty fascinating dude and I appreciate

573
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,910
that

574
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,769
yeah the the people that I know it came

575
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,570
from the people that Jason King saw it

576
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:55,759
from originally the people that put it

577
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:58,099
in the can of Bible those dudes were

578
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,779
from New York it's from New York right

579
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:02,629
it is from New York ten for sure that's

580
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:04,460
my understanding like I I the farthest

581
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,320
back that I have any experience with it

582
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,059
and the people that it came from

583
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,609
they had a New York connection and

584
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,929
that's where that cut came from Wow okay

585
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:13,759
cool yeah I've always wondered cuz you

586
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,019
always see it New York and Maui New York

587
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,569
in me yeah that's why they had the

588
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:19,490
salary out there too right at the same

589
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,309
time that was all the same group of

590
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:25,819
people and you know the scene was really

591
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:27,500
small 15 20 years ago especially genetic

592
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:28,939
scene back then because most people all

593
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,400
they gave a [ __ ] about was just finding

594
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,930
one good cut and running it till the

595
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,460
wheels fall off yeah that was like the

596
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,659
deal

597
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,669
no wonder it didn't really matter what

598
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:40,770
the string name wasn't in those days cuz

599
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:41,580
everything sold for great money oh sure

600
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:43,589
sure

601
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:45,389
I've seen him [ __ ] growing in Maui

602
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:48,778
growing [ __ ] plants and trees and

603
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:51,059
[ __ ] it's [ __ ] gnarly out there yeah

604
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:53,730
now that was how that HP 13 that I first

605
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:57,269
saw was grown and it was garlic so nice

606
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,099
like it was pretty much garbage I mean I

607
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:01,349
would be nice about it but it dudes

608
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:04,528
Reince trying [ __ ] in the jungle is

609
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:07,168
impossible like I remember I would ship

610
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:09,690
out a jar weed like I shipped out a jar

611
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:11,580
of Albert Walker for that party in 2004

612
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,470
and literally as soon as I open that jar

613
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,869
my buddy's house that we'd got wet yeah

614
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,179
you know it was like cured perfectly and

615
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:20,639
was like spongy with the with the crack

616
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:24,990
it Susie open the jars it turns into

617
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:27,750
like jungle yeah humidity yeah the hema

618
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:30,778
it's like 98% he made 100% humidity it's

619
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,849
like raining basically so as soon as you

620
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:35,940
open the jar just takes it it takes it

621
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:38,209
all on [ __ ] hang uh are you doing any

622
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,390
more [ __ ] work someone wants to know

623
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,890
um I'm not doing any more des work it's

624
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,070
just not popular enough it's longer

625
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,538
flowering um I'll play with it every

626
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:50,759
once in a while it's actually hard to

627
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:53,869
hybridize I saw rich in here earlier

628
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:57,720
also talking about his dog walker and

629
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:59,879
the Scooby Snacks [ __ ] that people like

630
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:04,079
to make a big deal out of yeah and like

631
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,570
every rich and I have mutual friends I

632
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,148
didn't do it as any intentional thing I

633
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:11,220
was living in LA at the time had no idea

634
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:13,259
that there was ID I don't even know this

635
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,440
was 2012 so I don't even know if rich

636
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:19,319
had made it or sole or giving it to

637
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,179
people or whatever yeah um but literally

638
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:25,379
I just made cookies crossed with [ __ ]

639
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:27,090
and uh um cookies crossed the face off

640
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,890
and I called its newest Scooby Snacks

641
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:31,528
and honestly it didn't even really sell

642
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:34,490
very well and I didn't expect I had no

643
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:37,619
idea until I moved back up to to Seattle

644
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:40,288
and then started working with my buddy

645
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:43,079
in Oregon did I even know that there was

646
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:46,710
a cut out there called snoozy sacks so I

647
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,839
mean is that what the dog-walker cuts

648
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,789
called Scooby Snacks

649
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:54,179
no dog excuse me snack says dog walker

650
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:57,059
and forum cookies is my right I didn't

651
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,920
know that either yeah yeah I mean I'm

652
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:02,490
you know rich is still in here

653
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,009
I'm sure he can uh he can tell everybody

654
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:07,200
but yeah the dog walker which is our

655
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:09,990
Walker oh gee I'm not I'm not sure who

656
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,660
made that side of it um and then that

657
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,190
hybridized with chem 91 or chem 4 I

658
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,810
can't remember if Rick's found out which

659
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,360
one it is I think he ended up saying

660
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,980
chem 4 is what he was told yeah yeah so

661
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,629
I think was supposed to become 91 ended

662
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,259
up being chem four I personally prefer

663
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:27,780
the flavor of chem 4 so yeah it makes

664
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:29,970
even more sense why I like smoking dog

665
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:32,910
walker here's my favorite question yeah

666
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:38,190

00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,109
he was he was how I ended up meeting Ken

701
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,359
though right I believe that yeah because

702
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:22,289
he was selling Ken seeds at the time

703
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:27,299
right yep I believe that's say it again

704
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:35,819
West Coast dawg no that came from Ken

705
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:38,430
also yeah West Coast dawg so so Jon used

706
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:40,470
to uh basically find medical patients

707
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:43,200
and get them to make seeds for that

708
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,000
seeds for him he'd take the seeds and

709
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,890
not pay him anything I'll [ __ ] yeah so

710
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,299
he had a couple buddies that were down

711
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:52,680

712
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:56,129
Westfall that's not what we're talking

713
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:58,620
about but Ken Ken dough who's the guy

714
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:02,220

715
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:05,129
circle of friends but not huh he's your

716
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,019
friend oh yeah I know kendo

717
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,150
yeah he's old-school too but this this

718
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,670
someone was asking if it's kendo that

719
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:15,390
I'm talking about the answer is no it's

720
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:17,640
a totally different [ __ ] yeah and so

721
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,350
John used to get these guys one of the

722
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,270
dudes name was diamond who's the guy

723
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:23,519
that's responsible for the u-dub cut

724
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:28,589
yeah that's on the long line it's not

725
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,690
you dub first first of all it's it was a

726
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:34,199
nice hash plant but it had no smell of

727
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:37,200
any you dub I ever bought buying pounds

728
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,490
out of you does um there's many

729
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,140
different strains that came out you dub

730
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,420
but none of them I ever saw was that one

731
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,759
Sera's diamond and his buddy Jim right

732
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,670
and Ken Ken remembers all these guys too

733
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:50,339
and so Ken gave those dues the cuts and

734
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:54,240
I got those cuts from them and that was

735
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:56,009
like the sour OG the Oh jurors the the

736
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,470
cutting that ended up being called the

737
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:00,779
'smelliot all that [ __ ] I want to know

738
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,460
personally about that who named banana

739
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:06,210
oh gee it was a kind of oh geez right

740
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:09,210
Rogers Ken named all that Ken named and

741
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:14,099
selected all that okay um he he had

742
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:15,418
gotten Sagar martha's 6040 seeds as

743
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,418
freebies with

744
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:24,690
that he had ordered from gypsy nirvana

745
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:27,179
gotcha and he liked that and crossed it

746
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:30,780
into the og and that's banana OG it was

747
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:32,639
freebie packs from gypsy it was just

748
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,220
bulk like basically skunk number one

749
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,409
hybrids because that's what I mean I

750
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,230
think Sam the stuck man was selling like

751
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:42,088
millions of skunk one hybrids back in

752
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,099
those days to all the seed distributor

753
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:46,259
guys yeah and they would all just like

754
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:51,048
package it up and sell give it away as

755
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:53,970
freebies or whatever it was you know and

756
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:56,789
yeah it was just that you know is that

757
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,769
cross with odors and then Ken grew it so

758
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:00,690
it was probably one of Sam's skunk corn

759
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:02,579
hybrids as the 64 do you think based on

760
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,530
the smell and and like the way the plant

761
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:07,500
grows the fact that it washes well all

762
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:11,940
that stuff leads me to believe that it's

763
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:13,048
probably um probably some skunk number

764
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,670
one cross just like pretty much

765
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:17,250
everything else and I've grown from that

766
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:21,240
era from Amsterdam our buddy Nick Vitus

767
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:23,940
is asking about NorCal catfish that's a

768
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:26,789
shot one right yeah that's ja but it's a

769
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,950
high school weed from the early 90s and

770
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:32,460
then the SoCal the SoCal cat face is a

771
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:34,439
cut that I got from uh this dude that

772
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,048
used to go by the name Philly used to

773
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,548
run a lot of weight up here um there's a

774
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:39,900
lot of local people up and see at all

775
00:35:38,548 --> 00:35:41,519
that will know that I'm talking about if

776
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,250

777
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:48,298

borrowed money from him to get started

793
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:25,739
in my first spot yeah when I bought my

794

to get going on that right and I ended

798

809

branchy that thing is I mean it puts off

820
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:34,499
cuts like crazy so anyways that's how I

821
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,389
got that cut

822
00:37:34,498 --> 00:37:38,608
that's a legendary string in San Diego

823
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:40,318
along with the Hogs red pea 91 and the

824
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:42,778
bull rider do you ever come across the

825
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:44,759
original bull rider I never saw any of

826
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:48,478
those other ones man I only ever saw the

827
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:51,059
Kappas right it was like Oh for that I

828
00:37:48,478 --> 00:37:53,669
got the Kappas from Philly yeah and

829
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:56,190
cannabis Reverend the guy thought my dog

830
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,749
[ __ ] buddy and our other buddy I don't

831
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,489
know if he wants to be caught

832
00:37:57,748 --> 00:38:01,588
so I'll ask him in the future if he

833
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:05,969
wants everybody know who brought our

834
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:08,849
brought our crew the dog [ __ ] but

835
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:13,889
there's also the the farthest back that

836
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:17,519
I know that the dog [ __ ] goes is my

837
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:21,598
buddy down in Portland uh that owns 5-0

838
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:23,879
trees right they got it in 94 and

839
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,548
supposedly it came from like Michigan I

840
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,108
think Michigan hermits and it was

841
00:38:26,548 --> 00:38:30,108
originally called electric Boogaloo

842
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:36,420
that's um that's a story that my buddy

843
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:38,068
that owns 5-0 trees that those group of

844
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,900
stores down Portland they were the first

845
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:42,818
ones that uh that got that cut

846
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,170
that that I know of and that's where

847
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:47,528
that that's where they say it came from

848
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:51,249
and your thoughts on Trinity

849
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:54,489
I only ever bought the herb from from

850
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:56,169
Eugene I did never see like the I'd

851
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:58,538
never see the cut or know anybody that

852
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,789
had to cut correctly all I ever remember

853
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:02,710
about it was really was that it had like

854
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:04,269
a root that I saw a couple different fee

855
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,269
nose of it so who knows what the [ __ ] I

856
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:10,568
actually saw right but all of them were

857
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:11,949
like very burnt rubber snowing they

858
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:14,949
weren't like skunk

859
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:17,889
they were like burnt rubber okay uh like

860
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:20,288
that burnt rubber cushy afghani smell uh

861
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,969
I I don't remember them tasting it was

862
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:29,259
really well grown but it I don't

863
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:29,889
remember it tasting better than uh then

864
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:31,329
it smelled

865
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,980
I remember being the opposite it's

866
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:35,440
smelling really good and not really

867
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,079
having a ton of flavor the Trinity cut

868
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,400
that I've been smoking that uh came

869
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,230
through it like that not so dog and

870
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,639
those guys have and Caleb oh that one

871
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,199
that one kind of tastes to me like the

872
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,058
old Elvis gut which is real interesting

873
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,639
I'm not sure if it is the ol Trinity or

874
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:50,410
not but I they're saying it is yeah I

875
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:55,719
haven't I haven't seen it so I really

876
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:58,118
don't know the like I said the Trinity

877
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:01,328
that I remember all of them smelled like

878
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,700
straight burnt rubber afghani funk and

879
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:06,220
it was pretty strong smelling but there

880
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:08,949
was no sweetness at all to that there

881
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:12,129
was no fruitiness there was no like off

882
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:14,889
smell it was just basically burnt rubber

883
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,380
I think if people confused that anything

884
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:20,379
that's not sweet but that's funky with

885
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,028
skunk I've been seeing that a lot lately

886
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,818
anything it's not fruity they call skunk

887
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:27,190
but I think it also has to do with like

888
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:30,130
I know when I've stopped smoking for

889
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:33,700
periods of months and stuff everything

890
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:36,460
smells way skunk here yeah yeah like og

891
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:38,858
smells like skunk Ken's sour cush that

892
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,409
thing was [ __ ] super skunky I mean

893
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:45,460
like if you think GMO has that bad

894
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:48,909
breath whatever's no ask ask about the

895
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:51,599
original sour cush cut that organ kid

896
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:52,778
can put out there that thing was [ __ ]

897
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,289
ridiculous

898
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:58,130
right I mean compared

899
00:40:54,289 --> 00:41:02,690
Lee it shits on GMO in terms of that raw

900
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:03,800
halitosis OG funk right yeah actually

901
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,409
which is totally different than the

902
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,480
burnt rubber I don't know I mean it's

903
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:09,710
just experience I think you have to have

904
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,050
seen it to know the difference

905
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,050
absolutely everything

906
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:24,949
Luda 707 seed baked he knows more about

907
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:26,269
that than anybody I mean that was like a

908
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,589
club cut that used to go through the

909
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:29,780
third floor at Oakland that's all I

910
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:32,420
remember about it

911
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:36,350
I've seen some blue dot over the years

912
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:38,150
but whether or not it was like the blue

913
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:39,949
dot that everybody talks about I have no

914
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,269
clue right the one that I saw wasn't

915
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:43,309
that impressive so it leads me to

916
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:46,550
believe that either people are smoking

917
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:50,690
BAM or weed or I got the wrong I saw the

918
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:55,400
wrong [ __ ] yeah well I mean I've been

919
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:56,809
fooled before so yeah we're someone said

920
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,800
something's really awesome and then you

921
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:03,789
see it you're just kinda like yeah let's

922
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,410
see what else you guys got the Maui POG

923
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:10,849
I don't know anything with about the pod

924
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:12,769
yeah it's a HP 13 I want to say there

925
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:14,719
would have been no edog or whatever it

926
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:16,039
is that's all I know about yeah I mean

927
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,189
I've heard like a bunch of different

928
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:20,989
stuff but I've never really seen enough

929
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:24,980
about it the Oregon pineapple someone

930
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:27,109
said I don't remember a whole lot I just

931
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,240
remember buying that herb I remember

932
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,070
seeing the pineapple d/s I remember

933
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:33,139
reminding me of the Hawaiian indica [ __ ]

934
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,000
that was going around yeah and that's

935
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:36,710
what it rumored to be and I think that

936
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,179
you know that Hawaiian indica line was

937
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:41,449
like pretty popular there for a few

938
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:44,169
years what here's a good one and we can

939
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:47,299
end with this this thing's almost over

940
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,099
what projects are you most proud of like

941
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,360
looking back on what you've done to this

942
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:55,339
point what are you most proud of

943
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:58,160
oh man on just one cog in the wheel like

944
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,780
I'm not I just was preserving genetics

945
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,859
because I thought it was important and

946
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:05,480
at the time a lot of other people were

947
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,088
getting rid of everything because it was

948
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,400
starting to become like a marketing game

949
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:12,409
I used to be able to grow [ __ ] and it

950
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,019
still sell in fact it was the most

951
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:17,118
in-demand product yeah ten years later

952
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:19,068
it was the opposite right nobody why the

953
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,150
long Forks Tevas and people didn't like

954
00:43:19,068 --> 00:43:25,818
smoking them anymore it had become more

955
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:28,309
of a marketing type of cannabis market

956
00:43:25,818 --> 00:43:31,369
than it was before right yeah and

957
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:32,749
Sabrina's I I'm just happy that I was in

958
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:34,969
the right place at the right time was

959
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:37,278
able to get a lot of these really good

960
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:39,949
cuts and kind of put them all in one

961
00:43:37,278 --> 00:43:42,528
place and make sure that they they stuck

962
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:50,449
around I mean that's it one more quick

963
00:43:42,528 --> 00:43:54,559
one with Casas yeah that was Chris's

964
00:43:50,449 --> 00:43:57,108
brothers cut he lived in Portland Chris

965
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:59,059
gave me that cut when he I think when he

966
00:43:57,108 --> 00:44:00,588
moved back or actually I think I got it

967
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:02,239
from his buddy up here a couple years

968
00:44:00,588 --> 00:44:06,018
after he'd moved back to LA something

969
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:09,039
like that and I had seeded it up with

970
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:12,198
the face off I never sold seeds of it

971
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:14,299
but uh I've made seeds with it I have

972
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:19,548
Albert Walker face of our Albert Walker

973
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:21,318
manic crossed with that tie also um and

974
00:44:19,548 --> 00:44:23,688
I gave Chris a handful of those seeds

975
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:25,429
and he's gonna work it just partly an

976
00:44:23,688 --> 00:44:28,098
homage to his brother that tie was

977
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:30,739
really interesting it definitely it was

978
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:33,349
like um it was like bubblegum

979
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:36,318
and burnt onion or not burnt onion but

980
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:40,548
like like a really strong cutting onion

981
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:43,130
smell and bubblegum and like a little

982
00:44:40,548 --> 00:44:46,369
bit of the super Silver Haze yeah

983
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:48,380
hazy back end but not not really like

984
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:53,479
when you smell it you don't think haze

985
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:57,079
it's mostly that like a tropical cut

986
00:44:53,478 --> 00:44:59,778
onion type of smell so it's pretty

987
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:02,028
unique then oh it's super new unique you

988
00:44:59,778 --> 00:45:05,150
know it was stunk and I mean it did like

989
00:45:02,028 --> 00:45:08,568
the classic little bananas all up the

990
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:10,869
calyxes yeah up the top colas when it

991
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:15,259
