Mendocino welcome to the underground

so we're here with heavy days from the

13
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,479
podcast and um we wanted to talk with

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,379
him about his journey through cannabis

15
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,819
um where he started how he got into

16
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:08,579
podcasting period not only that but

17
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,459
taking that journey into breeding into

18
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,900
making seeds and um and and the whole

19
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,339
political climate in Australia and

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,320
however how he's grown throughout this

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,200
journey so I want to start from the

22
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,079
beginning with you do this kind of um

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,939
A to Z how did you get started what

24
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,459
where did you get that that spark for

25
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,679
cannabis in Australia

26
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,419
yeah great question

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,100
um I guess first off I'll just say you

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,740
know huge thanks for having me on guys

29
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,679
it's a pleasure to be joined by some of

30
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:41,339
my my favorite podcasts so super stoked

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,200
and um yeah to your question good good

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,740
question right because the Australian

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,079
scene historically has been just very

34
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,000
fledgling and very much in the shadows

35
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,158
of the US

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,438
um sort of wasn't a lot of notable

37
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,820
figures doing much when I first started

38
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,000
getting interested in cannabis which

39
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,438
would have been around

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,078
2013-ish yeah that was when I started

41
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,779
getting really serious

42
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:09,419
and I think initially the thing that

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,159
like really was the light bulb moment

44
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,259
for me was

45
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,199
um I actually tried some imported

46
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,739
Californian weed and I was like wow you

47
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,780
can like weed can be this good and prior

48
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,000
to that all I'd had was like the

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,378
Australian equivalent of beasters

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,239
so

51
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,759
for a long time I was like yeah cannabis

52
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,560
is cool but whatever and um yeah then

53
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,539
you try these Californian stuff and I

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,520
remember specifically it was it was said

55
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,378
that it was Granddaddy Purple but

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,959
looking back with what I know now it

57
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:42,659
definitely was not granddaughter

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,360
it was uh it was very green and it had a

59
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,598
very generic sweet smell not that sort

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,519
of Earthly yeah you'd expect

61
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,039
um but it it was nonetheless a light

62
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,939
bulb moment and then the next batch I

63
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,919
got

64
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,900
uh there was a few things that there was

65
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,458
like some jack Harrow which wasn't Jack

66
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,920
Herer there was some Girl Scout cookies

67
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,319
that wasn't Girl Scout cookies but there

68
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,059
was purple kush and I think it is the

69
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,518
Purple Kush that sort of goes around a

70
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,920
bit and that one made a very lasting

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,259
impact on me and I think the ball got

72
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,559
rolling from there and I had I had done

73
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,539
a grow before that but I got mediocre

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,739
results and it was my first gross you

75
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,199
know it was going to be a bit dog [ __ ]

76
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,259
anyway and yeah you end up growing out

77
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:28,619
you know like DNA or whatever because

78
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,239
always yeah like it's it's a given your

79
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,400
first grow you don't know who's a good

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,000
breeder so you're just gonna get lost in

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,819
the marketing so so yes I came back to

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,699
it and um I just started getting

83
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,518
interested in it and at the time I was

84
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,798
applying for graduate school and part of

85
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,840
the entry requirement was um there was

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,260
like this essay component and I wasn't

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,200
good at writing so I started um writing

88
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,179
these largely speaking sort of opinion

89
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,459
pieces on cannabis and sort of the state

90
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,280
of the scene in Australia and I would

91
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,840
talk about how I was sort of a bit let

92
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,158
down

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,019
um I would talk about how I was sort of

94
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,598
a bit let down by the Australian scene

95
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,219
because from my perspective the

96
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,738
penalties for growing cannabis were far

97
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,780
less than the states and so there was a

98
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,120
huge incentive to get at it like why not

99
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,120
the penalties are pretty minimal and yet

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,740
no one had really done it and so I I

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,060
sort of wrote this opinion piece saying

102
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,560
you know I think the Australian scene is

103
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,180
pretty apathetic compared to the

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,740
American scene you know like during the

105
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,560
Reagan Administration like people going

106
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,500
to jail for just for incredible periods

107
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,660
of time and I just don't think the same

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,639
legalities were at play in Australia for

109
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,439
a long time and so yeah I was just

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,319
writing these opinion pieces and saying

111
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:46,439
like you know if you want to

112
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,180
um help get things legal in Australia we

113
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,699
need to be more open because at the time

114
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,340
I knew a bunch of like white collar

115
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,840
professional guys who grew but they were

116
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,939
totally in the closet they wouldn't tell

117
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,319
anyone about it and I sort of tried to

118
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,060
encourage people and I was like the more

119
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,519
you put this out there the more people

120
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,040
accept that you can be like you know a

121
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,198
family man with a job and and still grow

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,240
on the side you know yeah you don't have

123
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,800
to be a criminal like in a criminal

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,439
organization you can you can have a

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,480
normal family life anger yeah unlike the

126
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,879
way I look right now

127
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,879
[Laughter]

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,600
um but uh but yeah so so I think that

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,939
was sort of how I got my

130
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,400
um my feet wet was I was writing these

131
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,978
opinion pieces and I got to admit it was

132
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,779
all sort of guys just an experiment for

133
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,459
me to get better at writing and it was

134
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,918
just subject matter that I was somewhat

135
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,959
familiar with and then

136
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,279
um I guess the and this is probably the

137
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,978
part that I haven't really spoken to

138
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,459
people much about I then got the idea of

139
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:49,620
like well let's do a podcast and what

140
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,079
you find is if you're like a no-name

141
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,699
person like I was at the time and you

142
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,680
ask people hey would you like to come on

143
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,900
this podcast the first thing they'll say

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,639
is can you like send me something to

145
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,799
listen to so like I have an idea of like

146
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,900
what it's going to be and if you're then

147
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,660
like oh you know you're actually the

148
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,239
first person yeah people just stop

149
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,840
people stop replying very quickly okay

150
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,819
so I remember specifically I um at the

151
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,198
time Brothers Grim was like just

152
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:17,819
announced they were Reinventing

153
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,160
themselves I didn't know who who Duke

154
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,560
was yet I just knew Mr soul from like

155
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
reading online and stuff and so I

156
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,680
reached out to him and I was like do you

157
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,659
want to come on and he was like yeah

158
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
we'll do it send me some questions I

159
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,819
sent him some questions and then like

160
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,460
after a few replies he's like what like

161
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,620
um organization do you work for

162
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,099
and I was like oh it's like it's just

163
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,840
sort of me just

164
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,660
and and he abruptly stopped replying

165
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,579
that's about right that's about right

166
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,960
it's uh yeah anyone who's met Mr soul

167
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:50,519
will know that's pretty par for the

168
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,000
course yeah

169
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:58,560
um so then again being a bit of a newbie

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,959
I reached out to Swerve of caliphon and

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,639
um a very similar thing he expressed

172
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,239
interest and then after one or two

173
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,740
replies just completely ghosted me so at

174
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,699
that point I was sort of a bit like I

175
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,780
don't know if this is gonna actually

176
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,439
happen

177
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,119
and I just started following Duke

178
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,939
because I'd seen on the brothers Grim

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,579
website that um you know he was pairing

180
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,439
up with Mr Soul yeah and I I had just

181
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,839
asked a few questions in the comments I

182
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,300
think he had posted about some 88 G13

183
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,638
crosses he had done and I just sort of

184
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,740
said oh you know I read this Line's

185
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,139
pretty old and it's a bit inbred do you

186
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,780
find like it dominates the crosses yeah

187
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,519
and um I think just a few questions like

188
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,799
that he was sort of like oh you know you

189
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,079
seem to be interested in the genetics

190
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,780
yeah and so yeah I just I floated the

191
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,399
idea by him and I think I even linked

192
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,959
him some of those opinion pieces and I

193
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,519
think that might have been what sort of

194
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,680
got him over the line a bit thinking

195
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,180
like oh this guy seems to you know it's

196
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,860
not just like haphazard do you want to

197
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,500
do it he seems to be sort of passionate

198
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,960
yeah so yeah then we did that and that

199
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,699
went really well and I ended up we

200
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,680
chatted for a couple of hours and then

201
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,020
we actually ended up probably staying on

202
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,459
the chat for probably an equal amount I

203
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,719
think we chatted for like three hours on

204
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,180
the episodes then we probably spent

205
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,759
another three hours just chatting

206
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,860
afterwards about General stuff yeah and

207
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,379
you know we sort of developed a rapport

208
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,360
and at the end of it he was like I'm

209
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,099
gonna do you a favor and I didn't really

210
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
know what he meant I thought coming on

211
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,459
the episode was the fact I was very

212
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,439
thankful

213
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,598
um but so I just went to bed thinking

214
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,458
that was great you know what a once in a

215
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,019
lifetime experience to talk to like a

216
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,000
professional because like at the time

217
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,639
like you know I was just a nobody yeah

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,679
yeah and um yeah so I was really

219
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,278
grateful and then the next morning I

220
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,379
woke up and I had an inbox from skunk VA

221
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:49,200
and I'd never spoken to him at the time

222
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:51,320
and um in my mind you know he's this

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,480
mythological figure in a dream story

224
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,760
very and he was also very inaccessible

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,580
at the time he wasn't online he wasn't

226
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,620
talking and he just basically said hey

227
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,440
you know um Duke said I should message

228
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,139
you and that was all it said yeah and

229
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,660
and uh and um so then we ended up lining

230
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,419
up the episode but a hundred percent

231
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:15,719
without a doubt those two things

232
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:18,299
happening was definitely the momentum

233
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,759
which allowed the show to continue in my

234
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:25,319
opinion yeah yeah I think that it was it

235
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:28,919
was a big get to get uh uh skunk VA on

236
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,320
for sure and you know that I'm yeah and

237
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,479
you know he He Turned he's a good he's a

238
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,879
pretty good Storyteller

239
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,000
um and he also told the truth about a

240
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,039
about a you know a lot of aspects of Kim

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,799
that were that people didn't wanted to

242
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,480
know so it probably sort of launched it

243
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,778
a bit I would imagine

244
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,420
yeah yeah hugely and I I think

245
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:53,220
um uh not so dog you said this in one of

246
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,379
the Breeders Syndicate episodes not so

247
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,240
long ago but you said listening to that

248
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,759
episode he was he was pretty honest

249
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,919
about a lot of things and as the years

250
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,080
have gone by and I've learned more about

251
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,939
you know the behind the scenes of the

252
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,220
various incidents he maybe spoke about

253
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,560
yeah I did sort of start to gain a bit

254
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,420
of an appreciation that like yeah it did

255
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,159
sound like he gave a pretty honest

256
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,259
recount and

257
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,360
um you know like there's a lot of funny

258
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,639
things not funny but um how can I put it

259
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,959
like people and you know not so you

260
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,879
probably deal with this a lot too people

261
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,759
still constantly ask me you know who's

262
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,720
the Staten Island guy yeah oh my God

263
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,000
yeah

264
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,680
yeah and you know what's up what's a

265
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,980
what's a bummer about that for me is

266
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,559
that because he shunned the spotlight on

267
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,180
the forums and anywhere else

268
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,119
um he's probably the single biggest

269
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,319
person responsible for keeping the chems

270
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,539
alive

271
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,640
right at least for that period of time

272
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,199
until he spread them out a little bit to

273
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,939
his friend group

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,379
um and he doesn't and he brought the

275
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,240
super skunk West

276
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,000
uh and he doesn't really get talked

277
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,440
about and he doesn't want us to say his

278
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,379
name

279
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,560
so I asked if Staten Island was like an

280
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,879
acceptable you know the plume yeah you

281
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,679
know and he was like okay you can call

282
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,240
me that you know so

283
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,699
that's funny

284
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,980
yeah yeah you definitely and and as and

285
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,440
as I learned more about the story and

286
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,959
sort of the interplay between

287
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,399
um you know skunk ba not so dog some of

288
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,559
the other characters in the scene the

289
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,839
Staten Island guy I started to like

290
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,219
realize the story a bit more on the back

291
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,720
end and I was like oh okay this is

292
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,759
actually like really interesting and

293
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,399
yeah um I can understand the Staten

294
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,778
Island guys perspective and he's he he

295
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,100
always like you know obviously I've

296
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:37,019
never met him or spoke to him and

297
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,180
whatnot and I I know not so dog you're

298
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:44,759
you're very close with him but um yeah

299
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:46,620
they're smoking to him yeah there you go

300
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,480
but I just I just sort of understood

301
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,459
that he was from that Old Guard which

302
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,259
was like you know I keep to the Shadows

303
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:54,179
I do my thing

304
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,039
um so yeah that that was definitely

305
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,039
really interesting but I think that was

306
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,899
largely speaking how I got into it all

307
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,819
and then um you know it all sort of just

308
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,559
started to gain a bit of momentum from

309
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,720
there and uh we just sort of branched

310
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,419
out a bit really because everyone you

311
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,879
know I I owe a huge amount of um you

312
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,500
know appreciation and gratitude to to

313
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,480
everyone in the first ten because as

314
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,820
much as you know the first two I

315
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,259
referenced gave me some momentum I think

316
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,240
I have to be honest I think there was a

317
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,039
bit of a lull between episode sort of

318
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,539
four to seven where I had some people

319
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,120
that I was interested in but maybe

320
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:31,379
weren't super super big

321
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,720
um right yeah definitely so sometimes

322
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:36,419
the interesting people aren't who who

323
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,040
like necessarily everybody wants to hear

324
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:41,338
about that moment but it's who we want

325
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,500
to talk to you know I feel you yeah but

326
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,899
yeah definitely people like yourself

327
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,399
um mean Jane and Bodhi and you know some

328
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,379
of the big name guys in the first sort

329
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,379
of 10 to 12 episodes which is hugely

330
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,778
impactful and I I honestly all the time

331
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,639
think about how different it would have

332
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:58,679
been if like I didn't have those people

333
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,320
including yourself you know I I imagine

334
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,539
I I look at a lot of other podcasts and

335
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,860
I see it takes a long time to get a big

336
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,139
following and I just think I was very

337
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,980
lucky to to get that sort of push

338
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:13,799
initially yeah you got some people that

339
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,259
the community uh likes a lot and some

340
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,939
people that were interesting and stories

341
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,458
that they wanted to hear

342
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,899
and I think that that probably had a lot

343
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,539
to do with it too

344
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,458
um I've always been super interested to

345
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,860
be frank in that the fact that you like

346
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:31,619
because our world is so underground

347
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,899
right there's like layers of what people

348
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,700
know about each other you know from like

349
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,200
Insider information that I'm sure like

350
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,360
as you've been in the scene now a while

351
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,278
you've heard a lot but when you're first

352
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,459
getting involved you typically only know

353
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,939
like Legends or public personas right

354
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:49,799
yeah and so even figuring out like who's

355
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,959
who

356
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,338
um can be I you know I always looked at

357
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,199
that because it's like it happened for

358
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,060
me like organically or Matt just being

359
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,100
around the forums being in the scene

360
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,319
living in California for so many years

361
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,959
like I knew a lot of these people in

362
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,940
real life yeah yeah you know but you're

363
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,319
on the other side of the planet you know

364
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,940
and you're trying to determine who to

365
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,339
talk to

366
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,339
um and uh you know we're a quirky Bunch

367
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:17,100
yeah how did that work for you like like

368
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,660
trying to slowly figure out like maybe

369
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,040
not necessarily who is full of [ __ ] but

370
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:25,199
who is more who's who's perspective

371
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:27,000
aligned most with how you see the

372
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,920
history going how did you start figuring

373
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,839
that out what was what were some of the

374
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,778
the

375
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,720
steps in stepping stones in that process

376
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:39,120
yeah what a great question I I have to

377
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,620
be honest I I'll I'm probably I haven't

378
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,698
actually super thought about that so I'm

379
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,320
just going to give you the ideas that

380
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,539
are coming to my head right now and yeah

381
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,379
yeah

382
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:51,778
um but basically I think that um I'll be

383
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:55,860
honest it probably wasn't until like

384
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:58,620
episode 40 or so that I actually was

385
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,539
able to stop viewing every episode as

386
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,399
like this real Fanboy thing in a sense

387
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:04,078
like I feel like before every episode I

388
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,458
would get nervous and it was like [ __ ]

389
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,979
I'm about to deal with this big name

390
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,958
dude and you know what I mean yeah so I

391
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,480
think um I just want to put that out

392
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,278
there that um yeah that that definitely

393
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,959
was the case I was a bit Starstruck

394
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,759
initially because you know as you guys

395
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,518
said you know these

396
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,559
um really Infamous figures online who

397
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,578
you just get little tidbits about here

398
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,919
and there I think largely speaking I

399
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:30,958
didn't have too many people messaging me

400
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,299
saying hey stay away from this guy there

401
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,399
actually wasn't too much of that except

402
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,500
except for my name I believe that was

403
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,399
one of them you got a lot about

404
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,220
no not at all not at all I I mean like

405
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:47,100
maybe but like [ __ ] those guys like

406
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,139
um like I I always view it as like I've

407
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,820
always said you know consistently that

408
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,899
your episodes are some of my favorite

409
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,420
because

410
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,039
I think that a lot of guests are very

411
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:58,740
diplomatic when they come on the show

412
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,599
and I liked the fact that it didn't feel

413
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,220
like that with you it always felt very

414
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,720
free-flowing

415
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,879
um but to jump back to the question

416
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,100
quickly for a second I think generally

417
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,720
speaking I just picked a few people in

418
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,500
the scene who I thought were really

419
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,240
stand out and then I thought if if the

420
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,698
guest I'm thinking about is sort of

421
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,039
friends or cool with these people then

422
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,419
they must be okay so I think that

423
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:25,259
probably would have been the guiding

424
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:27,179
sort of uh feature but also I have to

425
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,799
reference I was lucky enough to come

426
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,559
visit the states

427
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,198
probably within the first six months of

428
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:37,078
starting the show so I got to hang out

429
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,240
with a lot of people in person

430
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,739
um and I think that helped guide the

431
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,120
guest selection a little more but like

432
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,159
I'll be the first to admit you know

433
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,860
there are there are some episodes that I

434
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,480
think haven't aged as well as others

435
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,480
um and and there is a number of episodes

436
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,879
that are just not available anymore and

437
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,278
that's for a variety of reasons and

438
00:16:53,879 --> 00:17:00,000
sometimes the guest has requested it to

439
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:02,759
be taken down other times we just viewed

440
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,740
it as inappropriate to keep it up

441
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,699
um so yeah I think that the selection

442
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,240
has gotten better over time I hope and I

443
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,740
certainly also think that I like to chat

444
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,199
to people a little bit before I get them

445
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,380
on the show and the other guiding

446
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:22,439
principle I have is that I don't really

447
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,939
take requests so much like people will

448
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,660
message me and say hey can I get on the

449
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,240
show

450
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,519
and they might be like a decent size

451
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,019
following but I have always said you

452
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,179
know in order to get a good episode I

453
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,538
think I have to genuinely be curious

454
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,759
about you sure yeah yeah and if you're

455
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:41,879
not it's just like a stale conversation

456
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,038
you know yeah yeah I mean it's it's

457
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,900
really hard when it comes to to guess

458
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,819
like I mean

459
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,500
even with just doing the live streams

460
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,178
for a long time there are so many of

461
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,058
those that I look back on that did not

462
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,280
age well in my brain like I'm like wow I

463
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,619
was really friendly with that person and

464
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,538
later on I'm like wow I don't really

465
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,798
like how that went looking back but you

466
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,720
can't you know I mean you can only do

467
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,859
what you do at the time and and how it

468
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,400
goes at the time and how you're feeling

469
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:11,159
at the time and and I think like over

470
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,840
years and years and years you it's

471
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,759
easier to go easier on yourself about

472
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,980
the [ __ ] cops when it comes to stuff

473
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,359
like that because it's just so it's it's

474
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,419
difficult to control other people's

475
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:24,119
actions and I think I think my opinion

476
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:26,460
on it actually has dramatically changed

477
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,439
in the last few years

478
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,600
um I used to think about it where like

479
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,460
to be honest there was some people that

480
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:33,480
you you've had on I don't need to name

481
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,100
names or anything like that because

482
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,860
that's irrelevant where I was like ah

483
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:40,259
that person oh no but then

484
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:42,959
over time I think I thought about it and

485
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,000
like I actually think to let people

486
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,519
really judge someone

487
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,798
it's really hard to [ __ ] for two or

488
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,500
three hours yeah like your interviews

489
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,839
are pretty long and like you give pretty

490
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,759
open-ended questions and you let people

491
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,579
talk

492
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,919
you know and when you talk that gives

493
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:03,599
the public a chance to see do I Vibe

494
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,520
with this person do I like what they

495
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,980
have to say do I get a sense of who they

496
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,000
are and in some cases people can't talk

497
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,179
the talk

498
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,038
yeah I remember it yeah and so that and

499
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,900
so that allows and I'm not you know good

500
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,940
or bad or whatever and so it just it

501
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,580
just allows like

502
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,980
um because our our our

503
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:25,079
scene is full of characters

504
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,000
you know there's definitely reasons why

505
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,038
people like to be isolated and growing

506
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,538
weed and not dealing with humans yeah

507
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,519
and you have to have a certain risk

508
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:36,119
profile and people get into cannabis for

509
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:38,279
all kinds of reasons sure you know

510
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,479
um and so yeah like you give nice long

511
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,960
interviews

512
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,058
and you let people speak you know

513
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,798
um I'll I'll say this I I was one of the

514
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,660
people that gave you I think this is the

515
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,599
first time we butted heads was during

516
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,580
and I'll say it the sub cool interview I

517
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,199
was super pissed at the time and I've

518
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:58,099
told you recently like looking back on

519
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,840
that because Monty's no longer with us

520
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:03,980
like I am so glad you didn't listen to

521
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,480
any of us I'm I'm because because

522
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,099
regardless of whether me and him got

523
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,500
along or what happened

524
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:12,418
it none of that matters because he did

525
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,740
work it was it was important it was in a

526
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,960
lot of people's Gardens and those those

527
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,819
stories need to be there we need to

528
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,500
whether they're accurate or not or

529
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,759
whether you know he was right or not

530
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,319
doesn't really matter we need to have

531
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,000
those stories regardless and he was a

532
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,359
major part of the scene for a long time

533
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,480
so I I wanted to try on that yeah he he

534
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,699
did and I was pissed at the time but I

535
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,160
mean

536
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,740
yeah I I just wanted to you know I like

537
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,840
now it's like even if even if it's not

538
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,400
somebody I prefer like I like to hear

539
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,379
what they have to say

540
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,400
sure you know because I'm always curious

541
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,480
about people's perspectives you know and

542
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,860
um you know and then there's an also

543
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,500
thing where like there's this huge

544
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,879
there's this huge gig to like

545
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,079
um you know when you were saying before

546
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,820
it's like there's a lot of people that

547
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,319
come on to be diplomatic

548
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:59,879
you know there's a lot of people that

549
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,200
are coming on that are trying to project

550
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,840
an image

551
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,400
and so it's probably really relaxing for

552
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,720
you sometimes when you get somebody on

553
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,880
and you just get a sense oh this

554
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,880
person's just being themselves

555
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,520
yeah hugely and it's I don't want to say

556
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,980
it's rare but I can understand like I do

557
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,779
it myself you know sometimes you've got

558
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,579
your own personal thoughts and then

559
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,558
you've got more public thoughts you're

560
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,659
happy to put out there but it is super

561
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,558
refreshing when someone's very upfront

562
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,019
and

563
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:30,298
um to sort of reference the the the

564
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,400
Monty interview you talked about Matt

565
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:33,900
that was actually a very interesting

566
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,220
moment for me because I didn't actually

567
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,559
I knew there would be some people

568
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,079
unhappy with it but I didn't anticipate

569
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:43,399
it would be to that level and I remember

570
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:47,339
uh old CSI left a comment

571
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,600
it's not like over a hundred likes I

572
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,418
think our whole crew probably said

573
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,339
something yeah oh it was it was yeah

574
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,559
I've never seen anything like that and

575
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:59,459
it was like to the effect of like this

576
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:01,139
ain't it buddy and um yeah I guess you

577
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,200
know sort of a related Point I've been

578
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,480
thinking about recently is that um you

579
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,759
know it's it's it's it's it's kind of

580
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,798
scary to think that three of the people

581
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:15,000
I've had on the show have passed away

582
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:17,759
now yeah you know being Monty bog and

583
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,240
Jaime Chiba oh yeah great I forgot about

584
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:23,579
I forgot about fun too yeah yeah and so

585
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,159
sometimes you lose sight of the fact

586
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:28,379
that like um yeah some of these guys are

587
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,120
a bit older and like you know

588
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,400
um as you said for better or worse it is

589
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,500
good to get their perspective on some

590
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,000
things and sometimes it's tough if

591
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,558
you're feeling like some of the things

592
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,619
they're saying might not be a hundred

593
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,259
percent true sure but um if nothing else

594
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:46,019
you know it's I I am grateful that I got

595
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,579
to speak to sub and interestingly you

596
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:50,400
know I never put this out there but it

597
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:52,678
but like from a technical level it was a

598
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,320
very interesting interview

599
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,298
um uh you know some sub got a bit mad at

600
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,418
me throughout it and actually hung up

601
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:02,400
the call at one point

602
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:04,440
and then I think his friend told him

603
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
that that probably wasn't a good PR move

604
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,960
anything yeah he called me back and said

605
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,900
that there was internet issues

606
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,840
[ __ ] up but like it was it was good to

607
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,480
get his take and you know I obviously

608
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,058
you know don't want to speak negative

609
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,679
um because you know I think we all can

610
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:24,599
sort of look at the last few years of

611
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,880
Subs life and and draw our own

612
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,678
conclusions but sure sub cool definitely

613
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,020
was the person who got me into growing

614
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,940
organically with super soil I don't

615
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:34,558
think Super soil is the best nowadays

616
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,240
but it was a great stepping stone for

617
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,298
someone who just never done Organics

618
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,880
yeah so so yeah for that reason I had a

619
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:43,200
bit of a personal like thing with sub

620
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,720
because I was like you're the dude who

621
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,400
got me him and actually um you know it

622
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,100
was the Rev him and the Rev So I

623
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,019
listened to your episode the other day

624
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:54,959
yeah yeah yeah the Rev he was he was

625
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,119
great and I I tried TLO and I had pretty

626
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,519
decent success with it and then I tried

627
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,798
super soil and I had pretty good success

628
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,240
with that and then I ultimately

629
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:06,538
um just moved on to sort of the more

630
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,359
general no-till you know it's it's such

631
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:11,279
a mindful these days but like yeah

632
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,558
um I I felt an obligation to sub for

633
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,819
that reason because he uh yeah he showed

634
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:16,980
me the Organics

635
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:20,099
you know anybody who came in during my

636
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,960
era like 2006 to you know all the way up

637
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,658
to

638
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,000
2013. like even me like Subways people

639
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,440
that I entered in seeing it was DNA but

640
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,779
once you got past like the DNA

641
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,080
Greenhouse like you know Spanish bait

642
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:36,178
and switchers you get into the Americans

643
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,859
Seb was at the top of the game then you

644
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,019
know like all of us got into that even I

645
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,819
was inspired by him young um I have his

646
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,519
first book Bank you know like I still

647
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:46,379
have it so it was it was an odd fault it

648
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,000
was an odd Fallout when we when we had

649
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,620
our Fallout because

650
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,419
um I did respect him and I did look up

651
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,359
to him at the time and it was just like

652
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,759
I was I was his antithesis I guess you

653
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,740
know sometimes what I've learned is I've

654
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,779
gotten older sometimes just do people's

655
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,700
energies just don't match it doesn't

656
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,839
have to be a hate person or I hate that

657
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,179
dude or anything it's just sometimes

658
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,639
energies just don't Jive you know and

659
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,940
that's I definitely know what it was a

660
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,620
slight digression but for connected when

661
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,960
I first started going over to Amsterdam

662
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,399
in the mid 90s and buying seeds right

663
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,019
and after I'd been there a number of

664
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,380
times I started getting introduced to

665
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:24,119
people okay and what I realized was that

666
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,760
everyone had their own version of

667
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,259
History some of these Old-Timers didn't

668
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,940
like each other and there was

669
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:32,519
significant beefs

670
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,679
and it was really Illuminating compared

671
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,839
to today because you know Matt and I

672
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:40,559
talk about all the time how you can pick

673
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:42,178
any hero from Neville to Shanti to Art

674
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,519
to all these different folks and you can

675
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:47,340
kind of tear them apart if you want

676
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,019
right and so people have their favorites

677
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,899
or whatever but there's a difference

678
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,538
between like lasting contributions to

679
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:58,019
the scene

680
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:59,579
and uh and and you know and being a good

681
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:00,960
person and someone you get along with

682
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:01,980
and someone who you agree with their

683
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,940
decisions

684
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,038
yeah

685
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,500
you know because those two things are

686
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,619
totally different you could make lasting

687
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,659
contributions to the Cannabis C game and

688
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:16,199
the Clones into the gene pool into the

689
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:18,419
knowledge and you could kind of have a

690
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,519
variety of of you know personality

691
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,940
quirks that aren't that cool yeah yeah

692
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,740
those things exist

693
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,919
yeah yeah yeah hugely and I think it's

694
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,500
only as I get more deep into knowing

695
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:35,038
people do you realize how deep some of

696
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,380
those uh divides actually run and

697
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,720
um something that's always lasted with

698
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,159
me is sort of this quote which was I you

699
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,140
know I can't tell you who said it but it

700
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,820
was like you know considering we all

701
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,860
smoke this plant that chills you out

702
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:49,079
there's a lot of aggressive unhappy

703
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,339
people in our community yeah I've always

704
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,960
thought that was interesting you know

705
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,939
because it's you know maybe it's like

706
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,480
that with every Ultra you know maybe in

707
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,400
like the 0.01 of the craft brewing

708
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,380
Community maybe it's like that too I

709
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,640
don't know but like it is an interesting

710
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,799
point

711
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,759
I think you know some of it is because

712
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,980
we come from a a subculture of like the

713
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,419
cowboy attitude of just like [ __ ] it

714
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,159
we're here bring what you brung like

715
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,960
it's different now it's there's

716
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,700
obviously a big culture Clash going on

717
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,159
we have we have the dudes who are

718
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,380
isolated like to stick to themselves

719
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,778
move weight we don't want to deal with

720
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,679
tax stuff or anything like that we don't

721
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:27,000
want to deal with the normal business

722
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,200
[ __ ] it's why we're doing what we're

723
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,619
doing so we don't have to do that kind

724
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,620
of work and um now we're merging with

725
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:37,379
the the realistic climate of

726
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,479
legalization and it is a hard clash of

727
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,120
personalities plus we have two different

728
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,179
Generations uh maybe even three or four

729
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,739
in some cases apart trying to work

730
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,298
together or not work together but it

731
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,740
coexists in the same sphere and it's

732
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:51,240
it's definitely going to cause some

733
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,579
Strife

734
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,500
um I'd love to know how you navigate

735
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,079
that when you're doing a lot of these

736
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,058
interviews when when you hear when you

737
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,000
hear something that maybe you don't love

738
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:06,599
so much and you and you want to put push

739
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,119
back but like what what what what is

740
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:12,298
that dividing line for you

741
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,678
yeah great question and brings us to

742
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:16,139
something I definitely wanted to touch

743
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,120
on with the audience if it's okay with

744
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,520
you maybe I could chat a little bit

745
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,739
about our falling out and how that sort

746
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,960
of guided my view on um sort of the

747
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,220
question you just asked yeah it goes

748
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,558
with what we were talking about the

749
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,839
heavy beefs everything yeah yeah yeah

750
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,119
yeah of course you know and and I can

751
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,558
completely appreciate um that there may

752
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,479
be some people listening to this right

753
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,639
now going why is this guy on here I'm

754
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,759
not a fan of him and I can understand

755
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,020
why you would have that view so I guess

756
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,259
um the first thing I would just say is

757
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:48,298
like I didn't like so you know we had a

758
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,179
falling out probably about two years ago

759
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:53,339
and I want to take 100 responsibility

760
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,140
for that and the first thing I would say

761
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:57,000
is that I never wanted to really discuss

762
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,620
this publicly until I was able to do it

763
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,019
with you because I just didn't feel it

764
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,699
was appropriate and

765
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,038
um so I just sort of wanted to do it

766
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,558
with your permission so to speak so yeah

767
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,859
I think historically I always viewed the

768
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,778
interviews as like like my goal is to

769
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:15,479
get the guests comfortable enough that

770
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:17,159
they share their inner monologue and

771
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,259
then you listen to it and then you

772
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,240
decide so what that would mean is

773
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,640
sometimes people would say things that I

774
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,519
didn't agree with or that I didn't like

775
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,700
but if I push back in the past they

776
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,859
would get cagey they would close up and

777
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,278
I sort of didn't know how to handle that

778
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:37,979
at the time and as a result I just felt

779
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,440
like it was better to just try to keep

780
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,120
them comfortable keep them happy let

781
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,380
them Express their inner monologue if

782
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,479
they say something that's really weird

783
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,000
hopefully the listener picks up on that

784
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,179
that was really weird sure yeah and we

785
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,519
sort of go from there so sometime about

786
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:56,278
two years ago I had Gage green on the

787
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,259
show and I asked them specifically in

788
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,419
one of our prior episodes we'd spoken

789
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:03,419
about the Colombian black from JoJo

790
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:06,899
Rizzo yes yeah and I had said oh I know

791
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:08,460
that you and Matt both had those seeds

792
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:11,219
um he has said something to the effect

793
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,659
of you guys put him out cheap just to

794
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,700
you know sort of get it out there so it

795
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:17,039
wasn't valuable you know what's your

796
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,778
take on that and they initially started

797
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,419
out by giving this sort of long-winded

798
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:23,640
answer about how largely they try not to

799
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,799
focus on the negatives in their life and

800
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,299
it was sort of a diplomatic answer at

801
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:29,819
first and I was sort of thinking okay

802
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:32,639
this isn't too bad and then at the end

803
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:34,918
he just went off really left of field

804
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,320
and essentially made an extremely

805
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:41,278
inappropriate comment relating to you

806
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:43,619
and your childhood yeah and honestly in

807
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,538
the moment I was taken back and I

808
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:49,139
thought to myself this guy's a scumbag

809
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:51,240
and it's crazy he just said that and in

810
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,759
the moment I tried to voice some

811
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,380
opposition to that and looking back I

812
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,140
wish I had given a much stronger

813
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,778
rebuttal I believe I said something to

814
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,640
the effect of I can agree with most of

815
00:31:00,778 --> 00:31:04,619
what you just said yeah yeah

816
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,059
um but I I want to acknowledge that it

817
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:09,839
actually it wasn't a strong enough

818
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:12,298
response on my part to what he said and

819
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,879
more importantly

820
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:17,038
um I just I didn't I thought that people

821
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,840
would listen to that moment and

822
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,398
basically go this guy's a scumbag you

823
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,379
know what I mean

824
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,558
um and I also thought that largely

825
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,419
speaking you and him had had you know um

826
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,339
conflicts in the past and it was sort of

827
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,980
just two people flinging insults at each

828
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:34,439
other however as time went by I realized

829
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,480
I had made not only a grave mistake but

830
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,840
one that I was deeply apologetic and

831
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,579
sorry about and I think the reality is

832
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,398
the simple truth is that there's no

833
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,379
place for comments like that on a

834
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,259
cannabis podcast it's just it's just not

835
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,120
appropriate and so I definitely want to

836
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:53,519
take responsibility for that going to

837
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,918
air I think that you know as the editor

838
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,720
of the show the buck stops with me so

839
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,700
even if I didn't say the comments myself

840
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,620
I have a responsibility because they

841
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,659
went to Air and that's under my sort of

842
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:05,158
leadership so to speak and I was

843
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,799
actually really grateful because it was

844
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,720
actually not so dog who messaged me and

845
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:11,519
he let me know some info that allowed me

846
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,620
to sort of reflect on the situation and

847
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,859
realize just how inappropriate it was

848
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:18,479
that those comments had gone to Air and

849
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,418
I specifically wanted to say you know

850
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,399
thanks not so dog because I always have

851
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:26,399
felt grateful in the manner in which you

852
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,319
approached me it was very humanistic it

853
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,439
wasn't like coming in hardcore like

854
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,240
you're a [ __ ] head it was like hey just

855
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,919
want you to know it would be cool you

856
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,480
know and I I've always been very

857
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,159
grateful for that response and I thought

858
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,319
it was very telling of you as a person

859
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,659
that even though you know I I'd

860
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,879
essentially done something bad so to

861
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,500
speak to your buddy you were still um

862
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,740
you know kind enough to come in and give

863
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,859
me the sort of that gentle influence so

864
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:56,399
that I was very grateful for so since

865
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:58,979
that time I have been applying a much

866
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,538
more active level of moderation to the

867
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,640
show and this is sort of getting to the

868
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:05,398
Crux of your original question sure sure

869
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,919
which is that I realize that there just

870
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,839
is some things that get said that you

871
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,159
have to give push back to because the

872
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,500
reality is there's going to be some

873
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,620
listeners who just don't find what the

874
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,538
guest has said to be acceptable or like

875
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,219
maybe it's like insulting to them and so

876
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:23,278
you need to provide some amount of

877
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,259
feedback so these days I tried to I try

878
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,119
to provide some degree of feedback so if

879
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:28,679
someone says something I don't like I'll

880
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,418
try to come in and say yeah but like

881
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,640
what about this angle it doesn't seem

882
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,919
like you're considering that and I try

883
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,538
to give some degree of feedback but I

884
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,940
also

885
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:41,519
um apply like a sort of more active

886
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,860
level of moderation in that in the past

887
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,778
I literally would not take anything out

888
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:48,000
the guest said unless they asked for it

889
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:50,038
to be taken out sure whereas nowadays

890
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,359
there may be some things I'm like you

891
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,460
know what we're just we're a bit off

892
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,099
topic here it's maybe not appropriate or

893
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,200
relevant and so you get rid of it so I

894
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:01,199
think overall it's definitely a

895
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,460
continual learning process and you know

896
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,280
again I I sincerely apologize for any

897
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,398
um you know harm or distress that that

898
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,560
caused and I take full responsibility

899
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:16,019
and I I view it as a very big learning

900
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,719
experience in my life one that I'm not

901
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:21,480
proud of but I'm glad that I hopefully

902
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,118
have you know grown as a person and can

903
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,039
recognize that that wasn't right and I'm

904
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,480
not going to make that mistake again I'm

905
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,639
not going to let you eat crow totally

906
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,240
because you did try to reach out to me

907
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,099
and I just totally blew it off and I

908
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,739
think you know it took me a long time

909
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,240
over over because I I can't hold the

910
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,559
grudge if people that know me and have

911
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,819
known me over years know and I get all

912
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,159
the [ __ ] Grudge like no one's

913
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,960
business but there were certain things

914
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,460
about that that I took very personal but

915
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,679
it wasn't necessarily from you it was

916
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,358
from it was because the dude knew me

917
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,039
personally and had personal info about

918
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,659
me and and the thing was that not

919
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,858
everybody listening knew that he because

920
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,539
it could have just sounded like a

921
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:00,659
[ __ ] mean slander at the time you

922
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:02,460
know but um yeah so it took me a long

923
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:04,440
time but when we finally spoke I was

924
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,880
very glad because it was it you know

925
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,099
that was heavy on me we were friends

926
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,720
like I had you out to our can Illuminati

927
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:12,059
party because I liked you you know so

928
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:15,118
I'm stoked that that we moved past it

929
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:17,279
but I was mainly asking you because I am

930
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,920
learning that process now myself you

931
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,859
know like you had the podcast I we

932
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,119
started this way after and I'm slowly

933
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:25,739
learning like okay there's going to be

934
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,838
people that like I might have to edit

935
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:29,399
what they [ __ ] say like I don't know

936
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,639
where to draw this line and I don't know

937
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,380
like is it is it different between each

938
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,659
person like do you just try to draw a

939
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:40,140
line based on that person and how

940
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:42,059
accepting they are certain it's hard man

941
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,980
it's hard and I've come to appreciate

942
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:46,139
what you've put together a lot more a

943
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,079
lot more being on the other side and and

944
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:51,118
so you you know I appreciate the the

945
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,039
apology but I apologize as well because

946
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,059
you know you were reaching out you were

947
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,619
trying to communicate and I didn't

948
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,900
communicate back and and really that's

949
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:01,200
all it took so it was always the The

950
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,838
Shining Star trying to like be cool with

951
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,819
everyone and I you know I I appreciate

952
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,440
it for that I do think it was very

953
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,240
effective for a lot of people it's

954
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,119
showing them exactly the kind of person

955
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,500
that Gage green was yeah you know um

956
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,019
that's why I never asked you to take it

957
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,358
down too so so there's I mean it

958
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:21,000
obviously sucks you know in that regard

959
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:22,440
but I mean it and you know as far as

960
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,539
like me reaching out to you or whatever

961
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,220
like I mean Matt knows this very well

962
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,559
like one of the reasons why I'm even

963
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,939
public is I'm trying to build community

964
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,920
and culture

965
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,960
you know as sort of like a bulwark

966
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,260
against all the changes that are coming

967
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,280
and so like I try to like in on IG and

968
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,660
all that like you know when you

969
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,579
mentioned about like not just like

970
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:44,098
flaming you or something like that like

971
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,859
there's a lot of there's a lot of of

972
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:49,500
that kind of like like snippy back and

973
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:51,239
forth thing that goes on in public and I

974
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,880
don't think that's like particularly you

975
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:56,819
know conducive to anything positive so

976
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,440
you know I I always try like you know to

977
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,599
reach out and see if there's like common

978
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,039
ground or to like show someone your

979
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,200
point of view and maybe you can bring

980
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,779
them along and I always try to be open

981
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,699
to that as well you know

982
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,140
um because to me like being a good

983
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:12,659
person doesn't mean you don't make

984
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,940
mistakes or [ __ ] up it just means that

985
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:17,578
you try to learn from it and you try to

986
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,740
you know make amends when you do and you

987
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,700
like being a good person is a work in

988
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,159
progress

989
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:24,899
and you know and and that kind of and

990
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,578
and so it's not like you never make

991
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,680
mistakes so you never look back and be

992
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:31,200
like oh man I wish I would have handled

993
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,838
that differently because that's asking

994
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,699
for Perfection Which is far different

995
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:37,320
you know yeah and I don't think you ever

996
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:39,179
did anything out of maliciousness that

997
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,920
was a whole nother thing to it it was

998
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:43,139
like there's nothing mean like you

999
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,579
didn't do it to be mean to me ever and I

1000
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:46,379
always appreciated that even when I was

1001
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:48,420
[ __ ] mean you're never [ __ ] mean

1002
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,780
back so I appreciate that dude because

1003
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,760
like I'm pretty goddamn mean look in all

1004
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,980
honesty I I think during that time

1005
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,099
period where we weren't chatting I just

1006
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,380
tried to appreciate that anything you

1007
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,599
said uh the feelings were essentially

1008
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,640
warranted and I I couldn't I couldn't

1009
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,380
deny you know that this person is

1010
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,199
understandably probably not happy with

1011
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,119
me and um I think that was part of the

1012
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,759
learning process and to speak to not so

1013
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,500
dog's point I definitely

1014
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,180
um am a big Advocate and I try to tell

1015
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,119
everyone that you know that like before

1016
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:23,399
you go and rip someone's head off drop

1017
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,079
them on the line and and because one

1018
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,059
thing I know for sure having had a bit

1019
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,400
of experience in like sort of the mental

1020
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,320
health field I've realized that there's

1021
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,180
a very very common saying you're hearing

1022
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,338
that which is like always assume

1023
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:37,379
ignorance before like um maliciousness

1024
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:38,820
which is like chances are when someone

1025
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,680
does something to piss you off they

1026
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,359
probably didn't think about it hard

1027
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,519
enough to wreck you know what I mean it

1028
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,319
probably wasn't like any and and I've

1029
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,838
certainly learned a lot from that and

1030
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,539
that's not to try to you know take any

1031
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,338
um onus of what happened no no I

1032
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:55,199
definitely could resonate with that that

1033
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:56,900
sentiment that you know I I think our

1034
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:00,059
community would be a much more

1035
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:02,099
hospitable and friendly place if

1036
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:03,960
everyone just sort of tried to yeah

1037
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,359
exactly what not so dog said you know

1038
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,639
just message someone in private you know

1039
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:10,559
chances are they'll respond positively

1040
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,139
and say hey thanks for letting me know

1041
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,279
I'm sorry about that how can we make it

1042
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:15,838
better you know what I mean like

1043
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,500
generally speaking I've had that

1044
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:22,019
response from people yeah you know and I

1045
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,400
hadn't I had just completely blacked it

1046
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:24,539
out you know after that it was just like

1047
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,519
I'm not going to deal with it not going

1048
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:29,400
to deal with it and then it's on Hill

1049
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:32,338
episode happened I was like wow this is

1050
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,220
a good episode he knocked it out of the

1051
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:36,480
park so you know I mean you I finally

1052
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:38,399
got to hear how much you've grown and

1053
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,500
listened to several other episodes since

1054
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,119
and I'm really proud of you man how far

1055
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,460
you've come dude it's it's pretty

1056
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,579
exceptional and the the Tom Hillman was

1057
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,780
a massive get and a huge I I think a

1058
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,519
huge achievement for the the whole

1059
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,140
Community because nobody really ever

1060
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,759
talked to him for a long time and had

1061
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,500
him put all that down on record and you

1062
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,940
asked him some of the most amazing

1063
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,219
questions that anybody could have asked

1064
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,960
him so mad props on that if anybody

1065
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:02,639
hasn't listened to it yet go check it

1066
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,599
out

1067
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:08,699
uh you're too kind honestly if if any

1068
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,059
episode is strikes you as particularly

1069
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:14,460
good it's because of the guess not me so

1070
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:16,440
um you know all props to Tom for

1071
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,179
everything he's done in the scene and

1072
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,700
for being willing to share that

1073
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:22,139
knowledge and more importantly I've been

1074
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:25,039
I've been very adamant about this from

1075
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:27,960
the start I I wholeheartedly believe

1076
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,119
that you know you guys will be able to

1077
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,400
coax a whole different library of

1078
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,838
information out because you you can

1079
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,400
probably relate to this right when

1080
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:36,599
you're doing an interview often you know

1081
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,858
they say something and you're like oh

1082
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,720
that's interesting let's follow that

1083
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:42,179
trail of thought yeah and and like you

1084
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,639
forget to ask something else so like I

1085
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:46,919
think that there's so much stuff that we

1086
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,719
didn't get out of Tom that we do need to

1087
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,940
get out and I think that it's going to

1088
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,019
come out when you guys go and visit him

1089
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:58,139
oh Lord

1090
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:59,880
oh Lord I will I will disagree with you

1091
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:01,500
a little bit there in the sense I think

1092
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,660
you're being too humble and that

1093
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,619
interviewing people I think and talking

1094
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:09,598
publicly is a skill yeah you know and I

1095
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,039
definitely think that you know you do

1096
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,800
something more and more and more you

1097
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,059
probably learn what questions to ask you

1098
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,940
know you probably got better at

1099
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:19,980
researching the your subjects and trying

1100
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:23,039
to think of good questions that your

1101
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,838
your listeners might want to know

1102
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,338
um you know I mean I personally when we

1103
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,320
started doing the podcast I started

1104
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:30,659
listening for all the weird verbal tics

1105
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,039
that I had that I didn't realize because

1106
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,598
you don't realize you have them in

1107
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,279
normal conversation and you listen to

1108
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,680
yourself and you're like oh man I need

1109
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,260
to get rid of that yeah right and so

1110
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,118
talking talking in public is hard even

1111
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,760
if it's pre-recorded or whatever else

1112
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,858
it's like it's definitely a skill and

1113
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,540
being entertaining you know not even

1114
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:50,460
that like with cannabis there's so much

1115
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,380
like especially I mean you can interview

1116
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,720
a lot of people in cannabis that make

1117
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,099
seeds and it's even if you have no

1118
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,819
knowledge about reading it does doesn't

1119
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,440
really matter because

1120
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:05,039
well joining an interview someone like

1121
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,200
Tom Hill is a whole nother a whole

1122
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,880
nother aspect because he's going to tell

1123
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,578
you you're [ __ ] stupid if you ask him

1124
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,519
a stupid question that makes no sense so

1125
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,200
yeah I know I mean there is there is you

1126
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,659
know if guests are great and all that

1127
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:20,578
but there is a big part of it

1128
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:21,960
if you don't know you [ __ ] and you get

1129
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,579
the wrong guess that can be really

1130
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,838
catastrophic and that's one of those

1131
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:26,039
guests that could have gone really

1132
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:27,900
catastrophic if you didn't know your

1133
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,699
[ __ ] because he will call your ass out

1134
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,200
so I'm proud of you for that one dude it

1135
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:32,879
came out good it came out good and you

1136
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,139
remember to ask about the chemist and

1137
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,880
stuff like that

1138
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:41,519
so thank you thank you in all honesty

1139
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,338
um yeah Tom Tom's a great guy he'll let

1140
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,500
you know when you're wrong which is um

1141
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:49,380
uh a good trade I I enjoyed our chats

1142
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,300
with him and um you know he's a he's a

1143
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,099
cool guy I'm glad that we're able to get

1144
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,260
that some of that info out from him and

1145
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,480
and hopefully at some point someone can

1146
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,060
touch base with the chemist right that

1147
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,119
would be really cool yeah well there is

1148
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:06,358
there is a chance uh that you know he

1149
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,940
doesn't he doesn't live too far from me

1150
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:10,980
um yeah he lives he lives you know he

1151
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,800
never mentioned exactly where he lived

1152
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,800
on your show uh but he lives probably

1153
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,920
like uh on one of the most famous roads

1154
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,660
in Mendocino uh for cannabis growing uh

1155
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,720
I would literally call where he lives

1156
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:26,578
sort of like the Beating Heart of of the

1157
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,439
Trump of the Emerald Triangle

1158
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,660
um and he's lived there since the 80s so

1159
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,179
you could literally like I actually

1160
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:34,980
thought you did a good enough job uh um

1161
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,159
on a lot of the genetic stuff I was like

1162
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,639
man maybe we'll just talk about life in

1163
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:44,039
Mendo and growing up like in a

1164
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:46,318
subculture because like I live in a

1165
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,420
bubble but where he lives that's like a

1166
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:52,500
bubble within a bubble within a bubble

1167
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:54,480
it is it really is like I it people

1168
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,699
don't know how much that little that

1169
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,400
area that he lives in and what kind of

1170
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:01,259
world he comes out so the chemist is

1171
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,639
supposedly his neighbor so maybe if I

1172
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,920
end up going up there and chatting with

1173
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,659
him in person which he says he prefers

1174
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,019
like who knows

1175
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:12,118
um but there are a lot of old-time

1176
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:13,318
breeders up here

1177
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,660
um and that's that's one of the

1178
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,759
interesting things is because you know

1179
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:19,559
you you have a tendency which is very

1180
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,480
obvious like to interview people that

1181
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,059
are currently selling seats

1182
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,619
right like to be like a commercial seed

1183
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,139
seller right because those are the

1184
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,880
people that get their name out there but

1185
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:31,440
a lot of those people got their start

1186
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,838
from people that have never been

1187
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,000
commercial seed sellers

1188
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,920
right they took a bunch of that work

1189
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,440
even when you talked to Tom he was like

1190
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,619
you know most of Tom's most famous stuff

1191
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,380
is the stuff that he liked the best from

1192
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:48,059
the chemist stash

1193
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,640
and he just improved with the exception

1194
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:52,559
of the haze you know um but the rest of

1195
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,239
it was pretty much just stuff that was

1196
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:55,980
he got from older people in the

1197
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,559
neighborhood

1198
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,000
um yeah you know and I think that's a

1199
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,920
big thing that a lot of people Miss

1200
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,780
where a lot of people think current

1201
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,980
breeders kind of come out of nowhere and

1202
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,380
they created all this stuff for

1203
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,440
themselves but they all had a starting

1204
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,599
material as well and a lot of times that

1205
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,280
we all stand on the shoulders of those

1206
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:17,700
who came before us

1207
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:21,140
and we just popularized certain things

1208
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:21,139
you know yeah

1209
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,119
I was just going to say something I've

1210
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,880
certainly learned which resonates with

1211
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,460
that is that as time goes by you realize

1212
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,140
a lot of the people with the big reps it

1213
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,838
may have been just because they were

1214
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:39,358
particularly vocal or loud you know what

1215
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:41,219
I mean like you're referencing they just

1216
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,179
they weren't putting it out there you

1217
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:46,379
know

1218
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:48,899
uh yeah I mean I will say that the skill

1219
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,599
set required to survive in cannabis

1220
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,599
during the prohibition era

1221
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:59,220
was very different than like the show my

1222
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:02,099
face you know burner publicity this is

1223
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:06,059
who I am this is putting your name on a

1224
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:07,740
strain yeah you know was crazy

1225
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:10,019
like trying wanting to know people

1226
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:12,179
people to know who you were and that you

1227
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:15,300
were responsible or associated with this

1228
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:17,759
and so in America a lot of people that

1229
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,619
didn't actually create the strain just

1230
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,180
became associated with it because they

1231
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:23,420
were the first people to become famous

1232
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:26,098
around it yeah

1233
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,838
you know and a lot of people got scared

1234
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,160
and like you know you know hide in the

1235
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:32,940
shadows

1236
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:35,639
you know uh for a variety of reasons

1237
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,579
you know unlike uh the king of cannabis

1238
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:41,779
we saw Matt hold up too long ago where

1239
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:45,359
is he where's our guy

1240
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:47,519
did you say that um they put out the

1241
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:50,639
like you know cookies is opening their

1242
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:55,259
own seed bank oh yeah you see greenhouse

1243
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:57,299
seeds in the tag yeah makes sense what's

1244
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,980
he gonna add like I really I genuinely

1245
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,920
want to know what's going to be on the

1246
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,699
menu that's his contribution well you

1247
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,119
know

1248
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:08,639
I I think like Ariane is is the

1249
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,680
Prototype burner for in the Netherlands

1250
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,219
so I I'm sure burner could learn a lot

1251
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:15,000
from him when it comes to seed banking I

1252
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:18,480
mean

1253
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
for one thing uh cookies opened up a

1254
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,780
smoking Lounge I believe in one of

1255
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,039
greenhouses coffee shops in Amsterdam oh

1256
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,440
boy

1257
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,019
um and so the collab the collab if you

1258
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,960
will started early

1259
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:36,599
um and you know Arjun for all all of you

1260
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,338
could there there was a and it's going

1261
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,980
on in America now

1262
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:44,279
there was two camps in Amsterdam and one

1263
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,559
of them was uh sort of like the the weed

1264
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,180
history and the weed nerd camp

1265
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,699
and the other Camp was like straight

1266
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:54,059
businessmen who were looking to Market

1267
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:56,639
and and and and and make a lot of money

1268
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:57,779
and Arjun was extremely successful at

1269
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,179
the second

1270
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,859
he was an he is an extremely successful

1271
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:04,019
businessman he's probably the wealthiest

1272
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:05,940
dude in cannabis that's what I mean I

1273
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:07,858
mean he can teach Berner how to go get

1274
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,900
Spanish seed too to everyone to

1275
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:12,059
introduce him to you no longer have to

1276
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,980
use these front men like you know

1277
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,599
whoever they're using that for the

1278
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,159
smaller companies that are repping

1279
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,260
cookie stuff you can just buy direct

1280
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:21,299
from the Spaniards and here's the I'm

1281
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:25,140
sure they have a beautiful business I

1282
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:28,619
bet I bet arjun's angle is that for 25

1283
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:31,199
years uh his town was the center of the

1284
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:33,240
cannabis seed universe and it's shifted

1285
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,879
to California so probably Greenhouse

1286
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:39,179
getting promoted by Cookie in California

1287
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,880
will probably Drive sales oh I'm sure

1288
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:44,039
and I'm sure their sales are far far

1289
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,858
down from what they used to be when they

1290
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:49,380
were the primary place you went to get

1291
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:51,179
seeds sure and then you know the

1292
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,900
attitude is popping up in the U.S now

1293
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:58,199
right you know who's running that

1294
00:48:53,900 --> 00:49:00,900
I mean I uh yeah I I uh Greenhouse

1295
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:03,299
probably Greenhouse coffee shop is

1296
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,519
probably the Prototype cookie

1297
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,380
yeah and look something that sort of

1298
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,920
jumps to mind when we're talking about

1299
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,019
this is that I I did want to try to slip

1300
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,440
it in at some point in our chat is that

1301
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:19,679
I uh I really wanted to encourage people

1302
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,559
to consider their own personal

1303
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,480
weaknesses and and try to address that

1304
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,799
so as we've been talking right like

1305
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,318
we've just said you know Aryan and

1306
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,339
Berner both great businessmen and we all

1307
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:30,539
know that there's a lot of great

1308
00:49:29,338 --> 00:49:33,000
cannabis

1309
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,279
um people in our community who are maybe

1310
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,318
good at cultivating but not so good at

1311
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,680
the business side or maybe vice versa

1312
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:43,259
and I think that one of the ways we can

1313
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:45,179
stop everything going to [ __ ] long term

1314
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,060
is through yeah trying to encourage

1315
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:49,739
people who are like the heads the you

1316
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:52,259
know the guys who we align ourselves

1317
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:54,659
with to try to get a bit more business

1318
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,240
savvy you know it's always beneficial to

1319
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,858
try to improve your deficits and this is

1320
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,078
something I'm learning myself all the

1321
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:03,059
time is that you know it's easy to

1322
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:05,280
assume that like you know yeah I'll

1323
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,960
start a company and like I can just do

1324
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,339
it you know you just make a website and

1325
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,599
you just you know what I mean and then

1326
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,920
when you start to really get into the

1327
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,140
business World a bit more you realize

1328
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,639
like hey you know I was actually selling

1329
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:16,379
those guys short they've got a whole

1330
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,779
unique skill set that I don't have at

1331
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,338
the moment and it's probably beneficial

1332
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,700
if I try to cultivate some of those

1333
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:27,480
skills myself so highly encourage people

1334
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:29,879
to like be self-reflective and consider

1335
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,920
your own personal weaknesses in terms of

1336
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,079
you know are you just limiting yourself

1337
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,240
to one thing and and you know listen to

1338
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,680
some audio books look at people who are

1339
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,539
doing it successfully like what we've

1340
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:42,719
just said you know plenty of people have

1341
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:44,460
walked this path before us and they can

1342
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,078
show you maybe some of the areas you

1343
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,720
could do things better in and that's

1344
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,420
certainly where I'm at in my life now is

1345
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,039
trying to recognize all of the areas

1346
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,559
where I might be a little deficit

1347
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,300
compared to others and trying to become

1348
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,980
a more well-rounded person because I

1349
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,400
think there's only advantages to that

1350
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:04,740
sure so here's a good spot for this when

1351
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,358
you when you got in into the idea of

1352
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:08,338
wanting to start making seeds and see

1353
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,440
your own creations and and see all this

1354
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:12,119
stuff you obviously were working with

1355
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,700
you know what you're working with at the

1356
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:17,280
time based on your your education level

1357
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:19,980
how has that changed now like what what

1358
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,420
where are you at in your your C career

1359
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,219
now as far as what you're working with

1360
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,680
what direction do you want to go and how

1361
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:27,598
has it changed from where it started

1362
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:28,618
yeah that's actually a brilliant

1363
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,059
question

1364
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,880
um because I think the answer is going

1365
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:35,040
to be a little counter-intuitive

1366
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,800
um when I first started making seeds so

1367
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,318
this is actually before I started the

1368
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,420
podcast or anything I was just you know

1369
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,579
some dude in Australia just making seeds

1370
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,740
for him and his friends yeah and at the

1371
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:49,140
time I had already completed my

1372
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:51,719
undergraduate degree I had a dual major

1373
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:54,179
one in organic chemistry the other in

1374
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:56,279
molecular biology and genetics so I

1375
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:59,179
actually have a degree in genetics one

1376
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:03,359
of the few people making seeds that do

1377
00:51:59,179 --> 00:52:05,879
but what I found was that besides the

1378
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,519
most basic principles it actually wasn't

1379
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,858
that applicable and I started to realize

1380
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,858
that I I didn't I didn't actually think

1381
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:16,558
it was a real credential after a while

1382
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:18,779
because for me for example the majority

1383
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,420
of people who have a degree in genetics

1384
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,819
or molecular biology it'll largely be

1385
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:28,139
focusing on human biology like you

1386
00:52:23,818 --> 00:52:30,358
eukaryotic biology not plant biology so

1387
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,159
I think if largely speaking if you

1388
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:34,078
understand the principles of like you

1389
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:36,598
know Punnett squares and mendelian

1390
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,240
genetics you don't need to go too much

1391
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,099
further because when you do a degree in

1392
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,318
this sort of stuff you then move to

1393
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:45,180
humans and you start talking about you

1394
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:46,920
know proto-oncogenes and tumor

1395
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:48,960
suppressing genes and these things just

1396
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,838
don't exist yeah it's not applicable in

1397
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,519
butney yeah for sure totally so I came

1398
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,980
into it thinking I've got this

1399
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,139
background let's see if I can use it and

1400
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:01,318
what I basically found as time went by

1401
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:03,779
is that like I don't feel like that

1402
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:06,599
specific particularly has made me any

1403
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,400
better I think that largely speaking the

1404
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,160
the things you hear our community

1405
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,318
commonly talking about are true I think

1406
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:16,078
that empirical observation is like

1407
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:19,500
hugely important just having experience

1408
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,300
making seeds looking at different plants

1409
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:24,239
and that's what I try to stress to

1410
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,579
people in Australia is you're limited by

1411
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,139
your exposure I have lots of people who

1412
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:30,720
message me in Australia and they say hey

1413
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:33,000
man I've got this super killer clone and

1414
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:36,058
I'm like have you ever tried a USA clone

1415
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,619
only because you might and be like Oh My

1416
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:40,260
My clone's actually not very good

1417
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:41,640
compared to this so and I say to people

1418
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,099
you know if you're growing your first

1419
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:46,139
ever plant you take a cutting of it by

1420
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:48,960
definition that's a keeper like you've

1421
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:51,719
got nothing else right so yeah yeah so

1422
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,699
as you get more exposure you get better

1423
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:57,358
so for me the thing that's helped me

1424
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:59,759
specifically is to just have had time

1425
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,980
making seeds popping them just sort of

1426
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,960
seeing what comes out but then obvious

1427
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,780
there's also the side of it which is

1428
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,818
like the the podcast and what people say

1429
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,040
how does that play into it I think

1430
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:13,920
honestly as time's gone by more and more

1431
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,960
I've become more in line with the

1432
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,900
sentiment that Bodhi expressed on the

1433
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,659
show which is basically that the proof's

1434
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,460
in the pudding don't judge anyone until

1435
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:25,500
you've grown their work and if it's good

1436
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,659
work then like what are you going to

1437
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,400
criticize you know make like I like to

1438
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:33,598
think of it as though we've got all

1439
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,280
these tools and the the reality is the

1440
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,140
more of those tools you incorporate into

1441
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,359
your repertoire it's probably more

1442
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:41,279
likely you'll have success but at the

1443
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,078
same time that's not to say you can't

1444
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,780
haphazardly make the next cookies

1445
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,880
because we can all point to various bag

1446
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,920
seed that have gone on to become clone

1447
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,980
onlys and they take the World by storm

1448
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,680
absolutely I think yeah it's great to

1449
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,179
have all those tools in your toolkit but

1450
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:58,980
I also think that you shouldn't limit

1451
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:00,480
yourself because you don't have a

1452
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,539
genetics degree or whatever you know

1453
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,338
like make some seeds like do something

1454
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:07,380
that you're passionate about and you'll

1455
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:08,759
probably find you get better results if

1456
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:11,338
you're Crossing stuff together just

1457
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,800
because you're like gel and Aid cross

1458
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:15,599
whatever is going to sell well like you

1459
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,160
you probably won't get too much out of

1460
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,500
that in terms of like fulfillment or

1461
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:21,058
experience like doing things you're

1462
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,699
passionate about going through the

1463
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:25,079
numbers and tying it back to What DJ

1464
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:26,879
Short said

1465
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,740
um you know the real way to tell if a

1466
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,720
male is good is to pop the seeds and

1467
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,058
find out you know that's the only way

1468
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,519
the only way that's to actually run the

1469
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:37,380
project yeah and and I think you know

1470
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:39,239
obviously you can be a good breeder it's

1471
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,400
not all like random or anything like

1472
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:44,219
that but I think that people shouldn't

1473
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,200
like trick themselves into thinking that

1474
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:48,058
they can't make something really cool

1475
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,699
because they don't have a degree in

1476
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:52,380
genetics or they don't understand this

1477
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:55,980
certain thing they don't have actual

1478
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,119
access to tissue cultured Cuts so yeah I

1479
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,920
just would really want to encourage

1480
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:02,280
people to get on board because as time

1481
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:04,619
goes by the more I myself encouraged the

1482
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,900
people around me to make seeds get into

1483
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:08,519
it it's fun it's it's what's going to

1484
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,039
keep you passionate over the long term

1485
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,920
and the more people do it with like

1486
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,719
honesty and and passion the better it'll

1487
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,000
help combat

1488
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:20,159
um you know stuff which maybe is

1489
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,760
produced from a more financial point of

1490
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:26,159
view absolutely yeah I mean one comment

1491
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,339
I'll add to that other than I basically

1492
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,078
totally agree with it is I you know I

1493
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:33,000
talk all the time about

1494
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,859
um there's kind of two sides to breeding

1495
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,679
one of it one of it is some like basic

1496
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:39,779
information but then the other is the I

1497
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:43,019
right and I kind of look at the eye as

1498
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,700
like the artistic side of it where you

1499
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:47,400
don't have to have an immense amount of

1500
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:49,980
technical knowledge to create something

1501
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,960
great you just have to have enough of a

1502
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:55,260
sense and enough of the eye and enough

1503
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:58,260
of being able to smoke and tell you know

1504
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:00,119
and and also on that you know it's like

1505
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,220
read what you like

1506
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:03,780
and you know the the best way to breed

1507
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:05,459
in my opinion isn't to grow what you

1508
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,440
think other people will be hot on it's

1509
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,179
more to like be like here's these two

1510
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,940
strains can I get things I like about

1511
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:13,558
each one of them in the same thing

1512
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,900
or maybe it'll give me something

1513
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,460
unexpected you know

1514
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,900
um and then on top of that too the most

1515
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,460
important part of weed the high is

1516
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:23,099
invisible

1517
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:25,440
yeah right so you can't actually see it

1518
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:27,420
you have to test it and you can't really

1519
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,099
test it with with testing you have to

1520
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,579
test it the old-fashioned way by

1521
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:34,559
consuming and then get feedback on it

1522
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:36,960
um and so I like that you came around to

1523
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,660
that side of things because uh you know

1524
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,699
when I when in Out Here in uh as

1525
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,318
cannabis is becoming legal you're

1526
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:44,399
starting to meet with a bunch of big AG

1527
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:47,400
people

1528
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,200
and they just can't believe how

1529
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,460
you know I don't even know the term to

1530
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,919
use they probably think that the

1531
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:56,220
Cannabis gene pool is just nuts

1532
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,500
because they're used to Growing these

1533
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:00,539
strains of vegetables or fruits or

1534
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,639
whatever that have Decades of breeding

1535
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:05,759
out of all these universities that they

1536
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,159
bred them to be extremely like reliable

1537
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,280
to these certain traits there's all

1538
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:14,279
kinds of ibls all over the place and

1539
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,859
then comes this big crazy manic very

1540
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,540
poorly documented cannabis gene pool

1541
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:20,279
that doesn't do anything they think it's

1542
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:22,920
going to do and they're like what is

1543
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,440
this this is a mess right but to us it's

1544
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,000
beautiful It's A Beautiful Mess

1545
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,740
yeah you know but to them they're like

1546
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,380
how do I make an IBL out of this does

1547
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:33,959
the exact same thing in the whole field

1548
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:36,480
and that's what we're about

1549
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:39,179
so it's interesting it's funny you

1550
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,760
mention that because the Australian uh

1551
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:44,279
legal medical scene is is really

1552
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,380
starting to take off it's sort of only

1553
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,359
occurred in the past two three years but

1554
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,519
it's really starting to take off and I'm

1555
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:52,798
really fortunate that I've been able to

1556
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:55,139
be involved with a few facilities be it

1557
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,818
like consulting or even looking at maybe

1558
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:59,460
trying to get some of my genetics into

1559
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:01,739
the facilities and the most crazy thing

1560
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:04,440
which relates to what you just said is

1561
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:06,779
that one of the facilities told me that

1562
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,838
they had spent Millions like literally

1563
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:11,940
10 million dollars from the moment they

1564
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,639
started the company until the end of

1565
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:16,559
their first year of operation and it was

1566
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,019
because they hadn't been able to put out

1567
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,480
a single successful crop in that first

1568
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:24,239
year and they're paying overheads for

1569
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,679
this huge facility whatnot and it was

1570
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,899
basically because they said the first

1571
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:30,298
six months we had to teach our Growers

1572
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,760
to grow and the second six months we had

1573
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:34,920
to finohan and it was just mind-blowing

1574
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,420
it was like like you guys did know this

1575
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,039
is what to expect like they didn't under

1576
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,079
they thought like what you said they'd

1577
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:41,639
pop a seed it would be the exact plant

1578
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,079
they wanted and they were like oh you

1579
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:45,598
gotta hunt through this and then

1580
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:47,160
propagate the keeper up and then get a

1581
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,200
you know what I mean it was it was very

1582
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:51,539
eye-opening that the big AG who had all

1583
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:54,739
this money seemingly had so little

1584
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:58,199
insight into the very foundational

1585
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:59,939
practicalities of like growing plants I

1586
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:01,980
saw that when I worked at the grapery

1587
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:04,980
and I was doing that big um them

1588
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,059
reversal on hitther and they I mean some

1589
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,318
of these are some of the best grape

1590
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:09,240
growers in California that have been

1591
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:10,858
doing it 50 years plus you know like

1592
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:15,479
growing some of the best most expensive

1593
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:17,279
grapes uh sold in California and um they

1594
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,539
were shocked they they had no idea what

1595
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,480
to expect from Cannabis they didn't

1596
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:23,338
understand that the the the the lack of

1597
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,960
sex control that we have over the

1598
01:00:23,338 --> 01:00:27,298
cannabis plant in the first place that

1599
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,039
is totally baffling to them that we

1600
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:30,659
can't control the sex very well through

1601
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,480
environment or spray I mean we can

1602
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:35,940
reverse it sure but like as far as

1603
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,980
keeping it female and 100 non-staminant

1604
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,559
like they don't understand that because

1605
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:42,358
that's the sex sexual stuff isn't as

1606
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,119
plastic in a lot of their their the

1607
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:48,179
plants that they work with so yeah it is

1608
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,099
a whole different ballpark it's a weird

1609
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:52,019
plant it's a very weird plant among

1610
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:55,019
plants even you know it's not just weird

1611
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:58,759
uh from humans to plants but actually

1612
01:00:55,019 --> 01:01:01,679
plants to plants it's a very weird plant

1613
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:05,040
hugely hugely it's a different game down

1614
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:07,440
here and um yeah it's cool to see the

1615
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,239
medical Market opening up in Australia I

1616
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,940
would actually love to see like there's

1617
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:13,558
no surprisingly no one from America has

1618
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:15,539
come over here and like

1619
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:16,920
like just set up something that works

1620
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:19,500
because as it stands all of the

1621
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,720
Australian producers are not really

1622
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:24,000
producing a good quality product it's

1623
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,338
all sort of Mitzi and the only decent

1624
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,159
herb you can buy is imported from Canada

1625
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:31,318
and so you can already tell that it's

1626
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:35,039
not the best of the best right like yeah

1627
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:37,079
it's um so yeah it's very interesting I

1628
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,759
hope that someone comes and sets up a

1629
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,798
facility in Australia and just crushes

1630
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,740
it but um it's sort of yet to happen

1631
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:45,119
that's wild I mean there I mean the

1632
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:46,259
second Thailand opened up cookies was

1633
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,500
there so I'm kind of surprised that

1634
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,839
Australia just has been a I used to have

1635
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,280
a dream of uh being wealthy enough to

1636
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:55,798
avoid winter

1637
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,900
and so I would spend half the year in

1638
01:01:55,798 --> 01:02:00,358
Australia avoiding winter and then I

1639
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,579
used to see these grows posted from

1640
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:05,219
Northern Australia by people growing

1641
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:07,260
Neville's Haze outside and they actually

1642
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:09,179
had a climate that they could grow like

1643
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,799
these beautiful sativa plants and finish

1644
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:13,980
them without getting cold and getting

1645
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,659
ruined and so it's I I never really did

1646
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,940
anything serious about it but I always

1647
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:19,679
kind of had in this back in my mind oh

1648
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,119
maybe I could go to Australia one day

1649
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:22,980
and grow all these different plants in

1650
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,420
my backyard that I could never do in

1651
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,358
NorCal

1652
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:30,480
yeah please come on over

1653
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,858
so so I know I know the Aussie fans are

1654
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,139
going to be super bummed if we don't

1655
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:35,338
talk about some of the the heroes from

1656
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:37,019
over there

1657
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:38,818
um yeah sure

1658
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:41,039
Where Do We Begin where do you want to

1659
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:44,039
start with you have a much better grasp

1660
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,960
of it but please sure so I mean I think

1661
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:47,338
for a lot of people the obvious thing

1662
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,318
would be like wanting to talk about like

1663
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:51,298
Neville or Shanti or any of that but I

1664
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:53,519
think in all honesty

1665
01:02:51,298 --> 01:02:55,380
um I actually actually listened to your

1666
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,239
episode talking about some of the older

1667
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,380
European guys and I think people should

1668
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,639
just listen to that if they're

1669
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,500
interested like there is so much

1670
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,298
information about the seed bank that I

1671
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,858
just didn't know that I got out of

1672
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:06,780
listening to you guys hash that one out

1673
01:03:04,858 --> 01:03:09,179
so I don't think we'll touch on them but

1674
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:10,859
I'd love to touch on some people who the

1675
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:12,779
international audience may not be quite

1676
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:15,420
as familiar with but were like pretty

1677
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,920
focal people so

1678
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,838
um I think it might in fact be the

1679
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,358
people you're referencing not so dog but

1680
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:23,578
there's this crew called the Wizards of

1681
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:26,460
Oz and it was made up of two dudes

1682
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:28,859
largely speaking Wally duck who goes

1683
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:31,318
online by the name um Donald Mallard

1684
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:33,598
he's on icmag he's one of the moderators

1685
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:37,019
he's a very well-known dude and then

1686
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:39,240
another guy called Moon Unit

1687
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:40,858
yeah and then the third guy you're

1688
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:45,000
probably familiar with or heard the name

1689
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:47,519
of is kangativa so oh yeah yeah so those

1690
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,619
three guys are what I would consider to

1691
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,838
be like the

1692
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:54,000
the dudes who are sort of like me but a

1693
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:55,920
few years ago where it was like a a sort

1694
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,358
of notable guy you could point to from

1695
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,680
the Australian scene and largely

1696
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:01,380
speaking there hasn't been too many

1697
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:02,940
others but what they did that I love was

1698
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,280
not only were they growing like cool

1699
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,619
Thai stuff and the mum bimby Madness and

1700
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,079
all that but they're actually working on

1701
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:12,720
trying to make some unique hybrids so

1702
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,760
Donald Mallard is the guy who brought

1703
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:17,519
the duck's foot to the scene yeah and

1704
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,140
that's how he got that name and I've

1705
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,759
done an interview with him it's a sort

1706
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:23,400
of interesting story how it came about

1707
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:26,160
but he sort of it's not too dissimilar

1708
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,780
to ABC in fact sure he just sort of got

1709
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,659
it given to him and he was like wow this

1710
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:32,460
is a real mutant plant and

1711
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:35,899
um it sort of went from there but

1712
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:39,960
they're they're notable for doing the

1713
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:43,858
z99 hybrid so that's a cross of Zoid

1714
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:48,480
Fuel and an F4 c99 from the original

1715
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:50,880
Heavens stairway stock so what was

1716
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,880
interesting about that was is that the

1717
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:58,440
Zoid fuel is a super interesting strain

1718
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:00,539
it's made by Moon Unit on his own and he

1719
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,059
basically did what Neville said he could

1720
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:06,179
never do which was he he spun together

1721
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:09,059
three land races to make something that

1722
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:11,460
is like very representative or akin to

1723
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:15,240
Modern cannabis he basically took a

1724
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:17,220
Chinese Yuan a PNG gold and an

1725
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,739
Australian heirloom sativa so probably

1726
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:22,078
like an acclimatized tie yeah yeah like

1727
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:24,000
that he spun those together to make

1728
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,640
something which to me looks very similar

1729
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,780
to like an Amnesia Haze or something

1730
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,838
like that

1731
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:33,839
except the high is like a hundred

1732
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:36,358
percent anxiety from that PNG goal

1733
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:38,219
you know why when he was a homie he told

1734
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:39,179
me that was like the white whale the PNG

1735
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:42,000
gold

1736
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:43,858
yeah yeah you know what I've got a buddy

1737
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,019
who reckons he might have some I'll send

1738
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:47,639
it over because he he wants me to send

1739
01:05:46,019 --> 01:05:49,079
some stuff to the states so we might

1740
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:50,460
look into doing that because I'd love to

1741
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:53,039
see people grow it out it's going to be

1742
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:57,420
a big plant man a big let's do a group

1743
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,420
project on it between the two podcasts

1744
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:05,179
anxiety isn't my favorite Buzz no not

1745
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:08,039
mine either but

1746
01:06:05,179 --> 01:06:10,139
it's one that everybody obviouses and it

1747
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:12,659
usually ends

1748
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:14,879
it exists in weed and it is strange

1749
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:17,639
sometimes what different strains give

1750
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,338
people anxiety and others it relaxes

1751
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:23,039
them I find that very interesting but

1752
01:06:20,338 --> 01:06:23,940
yeah the 100 anxiety crawl out of your

1753
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,980
chair

1754
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,019
uh that's always an interesting

1755
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:29,940
description did you ever run into

1756
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:32,219
smoking moose much in your in your

1757
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:34,920
research in the Australian stuff I know

1758
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:36,779
the name I I do remember the name from I

1759

see mag did you have much history with

1760
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:42,359
him yeah he was on uh Mr Nice forums he

1761
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:44,940
was friends with me Wally and and uh

1762
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:47,098
Moon Unit and he was one of the guys

1763
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:49,440
that a lot of us like looked up to as an

1764
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:51,298
elder in the scene but I don't know much

1765
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,798
more about like his actual history in

1766
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:54,480
Australia but I know him and Tony

1767
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,500
mullaway and a few others are real big

1768
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,740
out there

1769
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:01,019
yeah do you have much info on Tony

1770
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:03,179
yeah he's he's still doing his thing

1771
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:05,940
he's been providing

1772
01:07:03,179 --> 01:07:07,679
um like so I I've I've met him I think

1773
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,900
two or three times over the past few

1774
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:12,000
years just haphazardly not not at like

1775
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:15,599
events just randomly bumping into him

1776
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,780
he's um he's a he's a big dude in the

1777
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,980
underground medical scene in the sense

1778
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,559
that

1779
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:25,139
um he he would give medicine to really

1780
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,359
sick people yeah before like before you

1781
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:30,179
could really get it so yeah yeah he's

1782
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:33,838
definitely like an OG in terms of having

1783
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:36,298
provided a lot of like um RSO type

1784
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:40,139
medicine for people who are really sick

1785
01:07:36,298 --> 01:07:44,099
over the past 20 or so years yeah and he

1786
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:45,420
definitely gives out a lot of seed that

1787
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:47,160
um he says you know if you grow this and

1788
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,960
you want to make RSO it's it's going to

1789
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:50,460
be good genetics I'm actually not

1790
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,559
familiar with what the genetics he gives

1791
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:55,440
out but he is he is definitely a known

1792
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:58,260
dude he hasn't got online unfortunately

1793
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,858
there's a few guys like that yeah um and

1794
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:04,740
he's more of a like a a local Legend in

1795
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:06,239
like nimbin that sort of thing oh yeah

1796
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:08,219
nimin's a bit is that like you're

1797
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:10,500
Humboldt out there

1798
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:12,239
it it is and it isn't so the the

1799
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,219
Australian scene is very interesting

1800
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,500
because there's a huge divide between

1801
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:21,238
the Old Guard and the sort of younger

1802
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:23,960
generation the old guys largely speaking

1803
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:28,198
they like smoking

1804
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:29,279
but they're they're also equally driven

1805
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:31,500
by

1806
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:34,199
um Financial motivation so like things

1807
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:37,140
have to yield well those sort of factors

1808
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:40,738
yeah yeah the younger generation is more

1809
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:45,179
indoor cookies hype that sort of thing

1810
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:48,019
so in nimbin you can get lots of outdoor

1811
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:51,239
stuff it'll be sort of

1812
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:53,100
thai-esque it's not unfortunately it's

1813
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:54,718
not like the tie you would hope you

1814
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:56,400
would get where if I said oh hey I found

1815
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,798
some Thai and you'd be like oh [ __ ] Are

1816
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,139
we about to yeah a once in a lifetime

1817
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:02,219
experience yeah unfortunately it's not

1818
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,259
that yeah

1819
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:06,659
um but it's just like what we would call

1820
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:10,679
Australian bushweed so the acclimatase

1821
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:13,139
tie yeah exactly it's Gonna Get huge the

1822
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:14,819
high is not as unique

1823
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:16,859
um but the yield's good it's generally

1824
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:19,440
uplifting and it's generally grown by

1825
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:21,900
guys who only ever had exposure to

1826
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,358
sativa in their life you know like they

1827
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:26,639
wouldn't have got Indica until like you

1828
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:29,039
know probably the mid 90s yeah yeah

1829
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,838
right yeah like like even way after

1830
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:33,420
California sort of thing when it was

1831
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:35,338
just super commercially available that

1832
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,659
was when they would have got it so a lot

1833
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,399
of those guys are just like die hard

1834
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:41,579
sativa dudes so you can definitely get

1835
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,139
that at nimbin these days if I if

1836
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:44,939
someone came to me and said how can I

1837
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,079
get good weed in Australia or like they

1838
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:47,278
were like I want to come to Australia

1839
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:48,298
for a holiday

1840
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,160
um I just want to make sure I got like

1841
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:51,960
some good weed when I get there yeah I

1842
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:53,579
would say it's actually very easy to

1843
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,260
just find a good grower on Instagram

1844
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:56,460
from Australia and just be like can I

1845
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:59,600
buy a bag

1846
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,600
um yeah yeah

1847
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,039
let me interject something before I

1848
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:07,319
forget right

1849
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:10,198
um so one of the things I was thinking

1850
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:12,539
of when uh when you were talking about

1851
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:17,579
the the differences in you know in

1852
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:19,140
Indica uh in America versus there is

1853
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:21,420
um you know because I bet most of our

1854
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:23,159
listeners don't know like in a place

1855
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,980
like nimbin or different places like

1856
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:28,559
that that had some weed culture

1857
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:31,259
um how intense was the police pressure

1858
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,300
uh in that area because really what I

1859
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,840
think what started the huge wave of

1860
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:38,100
outdoor sativa to Indica in California

1861
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,400
was helicopters

1862
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,739
before the helicopters it was all sativa

1863
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:46,079
and then as police pressure became

1864
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:48,658
incredibly intense they wanted bigger

1865
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:50,279
yielding thicker and most importantly

1866
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:52,979
earlier stuff

1867
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:56,279
but I don't know if that that would have

1868
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:59,158
would have happened without that outside

1869
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:01,319
pressure you know

1870
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:03,899
um so you know if you're if you're a

1871
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:06,420
bush grower as you were talking about

1872
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:10,679
um what's it like for those people

1873
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:12,779
yeah great question I I think there are

1874
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:14,699
some people who could tell you they've

1875
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:16,738
had to battle with helicopters but I

1876
01:11:14,698 --> 01:11:19,099
don't think it was on the scale of like

1877
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:21,198
Camp yeah and some of those notable

1878
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:24,900
campaigns in California

1879
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:26,579
I think that uh largely speaking a lot

1880
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:29,158
of those outdoor Growers

1881
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:31,260
uh that if I had to go out on a limb I'd

1882
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:34,679
say their primary consideration is yield

1883
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:36,539
and so I think the the acclimatized ties

1884
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:39,000
always just sort of out yielded

1885
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:41,340
everything honestly because if you're

1886
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,500
like where Wally duck is which is like

1887
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,719
the northern part of Australia you're

1888
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:48,479
basically at the equator and stuff will

1889
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:51,239
flower all year round that's amazing and

1890
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,919
so it was sort of hard to compare yields

1891
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:55,259
if you've got like a tire that goes for

1892
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,420
21 weeks and it's just growing that

1893
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,699
whole time and that's where you'd see

1894
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:02,699
those crazy photos of kangativa posting

1895
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:04,979
the mother never forget them never the

1896
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:06,139
old mother sativa oh yeah oh yeah yeah

1897
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:10,259
yeah

1898
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:12,360
she's a good one and um yeah it it's

1899
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:14,699
it's interesting there are definitely

1900
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:17,460
some guys outside who who grow um

1901
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:20,158
indicas and I suspect that they would

1902
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:22,619
have had luck with that but I think that

1903
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:24,059
like a lot of people who I speak to are

1904
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:26,158
interested in like sort of what Wally

1905
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:30,179
duck has to offer which is like

1906
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:32,698
I've got this z99 hybrid so like the c99

1907
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:34,020
tames the anxiety of the Zoid fuels

1908
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:35,819
because they didn't want to get rid of

1909
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:38,580
the sativa Edge they still wanted it to

1910
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:42,840
be like an uplifting effect but not so

1911
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:44,460
like [ __ ] yourself so the d99 is sort of

1912
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,440
what you're alluding to not so dog it's

1913
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,300
that shorter plant but it's still got

1914
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:51,658
that sativa high that they're used to

1915
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,920
because they grew up smoking Thai so I

1916
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,539
think that was sort of the middle ground

1917
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,460
and I think that is in fact why they

1918
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:58,859
made the z99 because it was like hey

1919
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:02,039
this is like an indoor friendly really

1920
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:04,380
uplifting sativa strain that is just a

1921
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:06,060
little bit more versatile I want to

1922
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,880
modernize Australia and start pushing

1923
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:11,880
Appalachia over there it's like to me to

1924
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,679
me it's like the the like what c99 kind

1925
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,300
of always pushed for an early flowering

1926
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,158
something that had that really nice

1927
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,460
almost what people would typify as a

1928
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:23,359
sativa Taipei and um but fast flowering

1929
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:25,859
good density all the looks but just

1930
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:28,198
lacking a lot of the paranoia but still

1931
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:31,859
with potency you know I'd love to get

1932
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:35,279
that over there I'm always fascinated by

1933
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:37,198
uh things and breeding that occur

1934
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,479
because of where you're at not

1935
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:41,339
necessarily what you're after you know

1936
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:43,319
and and so I think like for people like

1937
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,420
Sam Skunk Man or something like that or

1938
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:48,359
Rob Clark or whoever like breeding

1939
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:50,158
Colombians in in California in the 70s

1940
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:52,259
they probably would have stuck with them

1941
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:53,519
but they wouldn't finish yeah so then

1942
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,860
they're like oh I'll add this Mexican

1943
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,600
that's a little faster you know and then

1944
01:13:55,859 --> 01:13:59,158
oh this is a little faster oh and then

1945
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,620
I'll add in this Indica that's a little

1946
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:03,299
faster now I have skunk one you know

1947
01:14:01,619 --> 01:14:05,640
type of thing

1948
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,920
um and and you know in Australia like I

1949
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:10,320
you know it like I said like I can't I

1950
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,658
can't grow a 20 week in the Emerald

1951
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:15,179
Triangle you can't grow a 20-22 week

1952
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:17,219
stream unless you light depth it

1953
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:19,199
starting months earlier it just won't

1954
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:21,000
finish it gets too cold the Sun goes

1955
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:24,178
away sometimes it rains sometimes it

1956
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,060
freezes it just doesn't have the weather

1957
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:28,560
um and you know so without with with

1958
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:31,560
tropical weather and no police pressure

1959
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,480
like California might be a vast sativa

1960
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,000
land still

1961
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:37,678
um yeah because you know it it it's

1962
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,779
interesting how those things shift and

1963
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:43,440
it sounds like Australia didn't have the

1964
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:45,779
same intense pressures to shift

1965
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:48,178
yeah well I guess like the one thing I

1966
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:50,039
could say in relation to that point is I

1967
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:52,679
think another reason why the like the

1968
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:54,779
old mother sativa and those things fared

1969
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:57,480
so well was because for the longest time

1970
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:59,279
people weren't growing indoors so you

1971
01:14:57,479 --> 01:15:01,799
were really limited by the conditions

1972
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,479
outdoors and if you're up like North

1973
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,940
like where Wally is

1974
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:09,238
the humidity and the temperatures are

1975
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:11,519
off the chart year round and so I think

1976
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,319
that lended itself to why they just kept

1977
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,640
growing the tire for so long because it

1978
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:17,399
would never mold even though the

1979
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,400
humidity is like 80 plus percent all

1980
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:22,379
year round yeah and um during summer the

1981
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:23,759
heat can get pretty I mean this is the

1982
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:26,340
funny thing historically people are like

1983
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,900
oh Australia gets hot it like the

1984
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,279
hottest it gets in California is the

1985
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:31,979
same as here it's just maybe we get a

1986
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:35,219
few more days of that here it's it's not

1987
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:37,139
particularly more but yeah just endless

1988
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:39,779
weeks of heat and humidity I think the

1989
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:41,039
tide lent itself to that yeah I could

1990
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:42,539
see that

1991
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,760
I don't think people from America

1992
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:48,179
realize how different the climate is

1993
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,280
from say like Sydney and Adelaide and

1994
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:52,980
those places down there up through Byron

1995
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:55,319
Bay and and nimbin and then up into like

1996
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:58,500
the tropical North and then you have

1997
01:15:55,319 --> 01:16:00,119
this vast hot dry desert in the middle

1998
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,979
um that's very uncomfortable and then

1999
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:03,179
you get over to like you know I don't

2000
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:05,279
even know what the weather's like in

2001
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:07,500
Perth or like that kind of like isolated

2002
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:09,779
part of Australia

2003
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:12,119
um but yeah it's essentially Northern

2004
01:16:09,779 --> 01:16:14,819
Australia is tropical right that yeah

2005
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:18,000
that continent is massive so yeah it's

2006
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:21,119
it's got a quite a diverse uh climate

2007
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,679
between it yeah so there's a guy in

2008
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,319
Australia he's an American dude he's

2009
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:27,719
from Oregon his name's Steve Solomon he

2010
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:30,299
um is one of the guys who sort of taught

2011
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:33,539
coot and then like so he was like one of

2012
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:36,060
Coots gurus anyway he um he moved to

2013
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:37,979
Tasmania because the climate is the

2014
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:40,980
exact same as Oregon

2015
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:42,599
so if you look at Tasmania and start

2016
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:43,859
going up so like you know you'd say

2017
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,539
Melbourne would be sort of the next

2018
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:48,299
thing above Tasmania which is at the

2019
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:51,238
bottom of the Continental Australia

2020
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:53,460
um that might be somewhat equivalent to

2021
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:55,319
like Northern California so as you go up

2022
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:58,500
Australia you're sort of going down from

2023
01:16:55,319 --> 01:17:00,899
Oregon and there is some a degree of

2024
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,340
overlap in the climates not not a

2025
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:04,920
hundred percent obviously you know

2026
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:06,719
Oregon's like very humid and wet sort of

2027
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,520
place and maybe Tasmania is a little

2028
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,859
less wet but it's still largely speaking

2029
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,480
very similar so you you can try to

2030
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:14,939
replicate some of the sort of micro

2031
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:16,439
climates but I think Humboldt and

2032
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:17,939
Mendocino you know they're their own

2033
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:20,819
special little egg I don't know if we

2034
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:23,279
have anything like that in Australia

2035
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:24,658
um and the only reason I saw recently

2036
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,158
something that really helped me with

2037
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:29,879
that was that it was this map of

2038
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:33,359
Australia that made the weather patterns

2039
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:36,359
in relationship to places I knew from my

2040
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:37,920
from America yeah right and like you

2041
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:40,079
could be like oh this area is like this

2042
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,658
this weather and this area is like that

2043
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,039
weather and this area is and I think

2044
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,979
that was like really helpful actually

2045
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:50,279
for me to like understand

2046
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:52,019
um you know the climate differences yeah

2047
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:54,779
and all that because I do think like

2048
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:56,699
maybe down south uh you know where most

2049
01:17:54,779 --> 01:17:58,079
of the population is probably is more

2050
01:17:56,698 --> 01:17:59,519
like California

2051
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:00,960
right

2052
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,420
um and

2053
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:06,000
um so you're saying like in uh in

2054
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:08,039
Tasmania maybe does the 45th parallel go

2055
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,380
through Tasmania I think it's pretty

2056
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:13,079
close hey yeah I think it's it's very

2057
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:15,539
similar and I know some dudes who do try

2058
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:18,658
to grow similar stuff Outdoors like I've

2059
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:21,479
got a mate who got some Jaeger s ones

2060
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:23,279
off Kayla yeah and he said they did

2061
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:26,519
really well so it's like okay I'm sure

2062
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:27,960
yeah I mean the the 45th parallel in in

2063
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:32,640
America goes through like Portland

2064
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:34,679
Oregon right yeah um and and uh but

2065
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,420
obviously it would be the 45th North and

2066
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:39,658
you would be the 45th South

2067
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:42,119
you know yeah um so you know probably

2068
01:18:39,658 --> 01:18:44,579
like probably for you guys like Northern

2069
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:48,359
Australia is probably like something a

2070
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:49,859
little bit like Mexico but more humid

2071
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:53,399
and it's funny you mentioned that

2072
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:56,460
because I I did sort of wonder how did

2073
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:59,279
nimbin become this hot spot of Australia

2074
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,960
because it's not geographically quite in

2075
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,599
the right spot it's a little too North

2076
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,460
it rains a little too much

2077
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,500
for it to be like

2078
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:09,300
real like a lot of the guys who grow in

2079
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,460
that nimbing area like they're always

2080
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:13,020
battling like the first reign of the

2081
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,819
season and stuff like that so it is

2082
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:17,640
really interesting that it got set up

2083
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:21,119
there I think maybe the reason is that

2084
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:24,119
um it was a the police's priorities were

2085
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:25,679
a little less there but um yeah I'd have

2086
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:28,800
to imagine that somewhere down near

2087
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:31,020
Melbourne would theoretically be the

2088
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,699
better spot to have your cannabis Mecca

2089
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:36,239
of Australia because it's just colder

2090
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:37,919
the humidity is more manageable and you

2091
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,899
just don't have these prolonged hot

2092
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,619
periods you know

2093
01:19:39,899 --> 01:19:46,319
yeah I mean I I think one of the you

2094
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:48,179
know I I uh one of the things that that

2095
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,219
um when I first read like for instance

2096
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:52,079
uh This is Gonna sound but DJ shorts

2097
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:53,880
book right

2098
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,679
um which is an interesting one but it

2099
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,699
had some tidbits that always stuck with

2100
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,319
me

2101
01:19:56,698 --> 01:20:00,719
um was he talked about how in different

2102
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,539
parts of the world there's just there's

2103
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:07,198
these cannabis regions that are ideal

2104
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:09,960
for certain types of ranges of varieties

2105
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:13,379
right and it just so happens in America

2106
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:15,000
that Humboldt uh and Mendocino County

2107
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:18,179
um and some of Lake County and some of

2108
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:22,140
Trinity are in this like sweet spot

2109
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:24,300
right where the temperature is nice and

2110
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:26,280
um like it's it's also like remote and

2111
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,199
hilly and away from authorities so you

2112
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:30,539
could kind of get away with it you know

2113
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:32,039
and it was dry as well

2114
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:33,719
um or at least dry and you know it

2115
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:36,960
doesn't rain in the summertime in

2116
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:39,899
California very very frequently so

2117
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,060
um it's interesting how now that we see

2118
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:44,279
legalization going on you see all this

2119
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:46,140
gear being put towards growing cannabis

2120
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:48,238
in all these places that aren't very

2121
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:50,880
well suited for it

2122
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:52,379
yeah uh it is you know there's lots of

2123
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,239
places that it's not very well suited

2124
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,980
and but a lot of times you grow where

2125
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:58,439
you can get away with it

2126
01:20:55,979 --> 01:21:01,198
yeah you know right and so a lot of the

2127
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:04,019
most famous cannabis zones in the world

2128
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:05,759
are places that a are suitable and B you

2129
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,159
could get away with it

2130
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,260
because you kind of have to have both

2131
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:13,139
you know yeah that's a hugely valid

2132
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:15,600
point I I definitely get that and I I

2133
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:17,659
have to imagine that there will be some

2134
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,039
new hot spots coming out of Australia as

2135
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:21,658
more time goes by and you know what's

2136
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:24,779
interesting as you said that you made me

2137
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:26,879
realize all of the facilities largely

2138
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:30,300
speaking that I interact with the legal

2139
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,159
ones they are down in Victoria and so I

2140
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:34,560
guess they've made the decision that

2141
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:36,658
like now it's legal like why why

2142
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,640
wouldn't you set up in the place that

2143
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:40,139
has the best environment for it you know

2144
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,360
so I guess there's some four thoughts

2145
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:44,400
there there is one or two operations in

2146
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:46,738
that far Northern rivers that nimbin

2147
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,539
area and I think they're just having to

2148
01:21:46,738 --> 01:21:51,119
try to brute force their way through bad

2149
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:52,439
conditions with uh yeah you end up

2150
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,179
spending more money

2151
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:56,399
in order to grow the same kind of

2152
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:58,079
cannabis I mean uh one of the

2153
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:00,439
interesting things is that when I first

2154
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:03,359
started going to Amsterdam in the 90s

2155
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:06,299
almost all indoor technology is like

2156
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,219
trickle-down technology from their

2157
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:11,219
professional greenhouses that they have

2158
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:14,819
in Holland and in Belgium and in Germany

2159
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:16,319
because their climate sucks right so you

2160
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:18,119
know they grow vegetables like they'll

2161
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:21,719
have like a hundred thousand lights of

2162
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:24,000
cucumbers and tomatoes right and almost

2163
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:26,039
all of our indoor technology that we

2164
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,420
have that we use to grow cannabis all

2165
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:32,039
descends from that happening you know

2166
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:34,260
um where Australia

2167
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:36,719
or America is the same way they're both

2168
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:38,880
big enough that you can probably grow

2169
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,560
various crops where the climate just

2170
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,960
suits it

2171
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,780
right

2172
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,819
um and you know and and you know some

2173
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:50,099
some places indoor is the only viable

2174
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:51,599
thing because the climate sucks some

2175
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,219
places you can grow maybe in a

2176
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,620
greenhouse but you'd have to have huge

2177
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:57,539
dehumidifiers and lights and all kinds

2178
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:59,760
of climate control because you're

2179
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:01,738
fighting the weather isn't isn't as

2180
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,659
ideal as you want

2181
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:05,279
yeah it's so interesting you mentioned

2182
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:06,599
that because that's literally all I've

2183
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:09,599
been thinking about in regards to

2184
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:12,060
Thailand it's like it's so humid and hot

2185
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,400
over there you I I don't even know if

2186
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:16,340
you could produce high quality outdoor

2187
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:20,639
crops I think you'd have to do it indoor

2188
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:23,460
and like yeah I is it I I have questions

2189
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:25,140
about whether the logical answer for

2190
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:28,198
them will just be to try to import it

2191
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:31,079
because like it's just so costly to try

2192
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:34,439
to overcome this just strangling

2193
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:36,779
humidity part of the reason I think that

2194
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:39,178
uh part of the reason when you see some

2195
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:41,698
of those like Thai sativas and they end

2196
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:43,619
up being like wispy calyxes that are

2197
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:45,059
just like you know a Tremors Nightmare

2198
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:46,559
and most people would just want to

2199
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:48,960
eliminate because of what modern

2200
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,580
cannabis is supposed to look like but

2201
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,739
it's probably with that level of

2202
01:23:50,579 --> 01:23:56,158
humidity that's the kind of buds you

2203
01:23:52,738 --> 01:23:59,879
need to grow to not have it all rot

2204
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:01,920
yeah right and like the effect is like I

2205
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,779
also like the um I can't remember who

2206
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,520
said it but someone was like you know

2207
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:07,380
life at the equator it's sort of a

2208
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,239
little easier because it's warm than

2209
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:12,359
like up north and so it's interesting

2210
01:24:09,238 --> 01:24:15,899
how equatorial plants tend to be more

2211
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:18,658
like sativa and fun and uplifting and as

2212
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:20,339
you get North or South you get these

2213
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:22,139
more Indica varieties that are sort of a

2214
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:24,480
bit more medicinal and maybe it's

2215
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,800
because Life's a bit harder in those

2216
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:27,419
environments I've always been interested

2217
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,579
in like sort of what you're talking

2218
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:31,739
about like the environment as well as

2219
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:34,679
like how that may be affected the type

2220
01:24:31,738 --> 01:24:36,059
of high that was selected over thousands

2221
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:39,840
of years

2222
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:41,280
that that's a huge subject too and I I

2223
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,279
think that

2224
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:46,319
um one of the reasons is that uh you

2225
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,319
know a lot of those sativas were bred

2226
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:51,238
for smoking the flower

2227
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:54,000
where all those indicas were bred for

2228
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:56,459
harvesting the hash the trichomes they

2229
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,219
were they were resin farmers and so

2230
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:01,140
Americans and Australia others you know

2231
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:03,179
it's it's basically you know when we

2232
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:04,800
started getting those indicas that we

2233
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:07,619
started blending them with what we had

2234
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:10,199
and smoking them

2235
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:13,979
um you know there uh there's a there's a

2236
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:15,839
funny story uh that uh uh Kamara tells

2237
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:16,859
about you know one of Sam's stories or

2238
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,239
whatever

2239
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:20,279
um about trying to get seeds in

2240
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:23,279
Afghanistan and he wanted flour to get

2241
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:25,380
the seeds and the warlord or whatever

2242
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:28,800
looked at him and was literally like you

2243
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:30,239
know women and slaves smoke flower men

2244
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:34,440
smoke hashish

2245
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:36,839
right uh and so yeah you know like uh

2246
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:40,319
the they're they they didn't breed for

2247
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,400
smoking flour yeah you know yeah uh we

2248
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,859
did

2249
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:46,198
you know so it's it's an interesting

2250
01:25:43,859 --> 01:25:49,319
divide the parts of the world that breed

2251
01:25:46,198 --> 01:25:52,259
for resin and only smoke hashish and the

2252
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:54,539
parts of the world that breed for flower

2253
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:58,500
very different very different selection

2254
01:25:54,539 --> 01:26:00,539
pressure in my opinion hugely can I um

2255
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:02,460
actually take this somewhere a little

2256
01:26:00,539 --> 01:26:04,198
unexpected because these thoughts here I

2257
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:06,480
need my mind I want to ask you

2258
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:08,579
specifically not so dog what's your

2259
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,939
thoughts on Mendo breath because it's

2260
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:15,059
such a hugely popular strain and I think

2261
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:17,759
largely speaking the popularity comes

2262
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:20,699
from the Mendo perps that's utilized in

2263
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,039
it and I'd be interested to know like do

2264
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:24,839
you look at Australian like that knowing

2265
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:26,158
it's got Mendo perps in it and that if

2266
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,500
you actually look at the Mendo flower

2267
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:30,238
now there's a good few characteristics

2268
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,679
that are actually you could say oh

2269
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:32,879
that's actually from the Mendo perps

2270
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:35,579
like the smell and the flavor

2271
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,199
specifically I um I'd be interested to

2272
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:39,000
hear like do you ever do you get

2273
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:40,259
invested do you like sort of track it or

2274
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
are you just like it's it's not really

2275
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:46,260
my thing anymore

2276
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:49,500
I mean I uh you know there's

2277
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:51,960
I'm all I'm I'm like you know super

2278
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:54,060
interested in genetics and what passes

2279
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:56,880
down and what think and what things

2280
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:58,679
breed for right uh and one of the

2281
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,420
interesting things is because you know

2282
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:03,719
I'll be I'll be totally honest I don't

2283
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:06,719
think Mendo perps by itself is like an

2284
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:09,119
elite complete strain like it's THC

2285
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,859
content and it's high it's like people

2286
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:13,198
that don't smoke weed a lot really

2287
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:15,479
really really like it but if you smoke

2288
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,579
heavy Indica all day long you try to go

2289
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:20,939
from like you know uh pure kush or

2290
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:23,219
something to a a Mendo mom uh it's

2291
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:25,259
lighter yeah um but it breeds really

2292
01:27:23,219 --> 01:27:28,380
well and it adds color and it adds all

2293
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:30,840
these unique flavors and I will say that

2294
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:33,239
anytime I ever smell anything that I

2295
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,880
think oh that smells like Mendo perps

2296
01:27:33,238 --> 01:27:36,779
I turns out that it has Mendo perps in

2297
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,940
it

2298
01:27:36,779 --> 01:27:40,859
right and not to say not to say that

2299
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:43,379
Mendo perps has that unique and nothing

2300
01:27:40,859 --> 01:27:46,198
else does but there are things that are

2301
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:48,179
older that had smell profiles like

2302
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:50,759
people hunting for Super Skunk Aromas

2303
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:53,279
that have been lost right and are either

2304
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:55,320
rare or only found in one or two lines

2305
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:58,380
these days

2306
01:27:55,319 --> 01:28:00,658
um and so you know I think uh I think

2307
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:02,699
Mendo breath got popular because I think

2308
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:05,638
with IG

2309
01:28:02,698 --> 01:28:09,000
um IG made everything that was going to

2310
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:12,300
be popular it had to be photogenic it

2311
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,760
became very hard in the Instagram era to

2312
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,199
have ugly weed because you couldn't tell

2313
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:18,300
what it smelled like and you couldn't

2314
01:28:16,198 --> 01:28:20,638
tell what it what's its high was like

2315
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:23,340
but you could tell what it looked like

2316
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:26,159
and Mendo breath is very pretty

2317
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:28,199
it's thick it's juicy huh I remember

2318
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:30,238
when it came out a lot of the popularity

2319
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:32,759
for it was because of the looks and a

2320
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:34,319
lot of the looks for ogkb at the time I

2321
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,060
think the staying popularity and the

2322
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,979
reason people used it was because of the

2323
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:39,960
Mendo perps to be honest there was a lot

2324
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:42,000
of other OG KB offerings at the time

2325
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:44,819
like it was one of the later ones that

2326
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,219
that came out and one of the the last

2327
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:49,738
ones from the original era of the ogkb

2328
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:51,658
hybrids and it had some of the best

2329
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:53,698
pictures of it but I think it's staying

2330
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:55,979
power in lines was Mendo pervs because

2331
01:28:53,698 --> 01:28:57,960
of the the terp content stuff like that

2332
01:28:55,979 --> 01:29:00,419
that adds uniqueness to lines for sure

2333
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:03,179
that's a good idea

2334
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:05,399
heavy days one of the things about that

2335
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:07,800
that for like someone who likes to know

2336
01:29:05,399 --> 01:29:09,960
like lineage and history

2337
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:13,199
um is that a lot of breeders like to

2338
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:15,899
obscure what where they got the sauce

2339
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:18,059
that they got to make what they made and

2340
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:21,479
so people generally speaking are not

2341
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:24,000
super honest about origin stories it's

2342
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:25,439
it's more rare than you would like

2343
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,179
um because they want to be like oh I

2344
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:28,439
made this famous thing and it's all my

2345
01:29:27,179 --> 01:29:30,179
my gig

2346
01:29:28,439 --> 01:29:31,738
they don't want to be like oh I took a

2347
01:29:30,179 --> 01:29:33,420
piece from here and a piece from there

2348
01:29:31,738 --> 01:29:35,879
and a piece from there and it blended it

2349
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,440
together and Bam I got lucky there it is

2350
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,600
right yeah and maybe they don't even

2351
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:41,399
like the person that the that one of the

2352
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:44,880
we the strains came from so they don't

2353
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:47,939
want to credit that person yeah yeah

2354
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,440
um and uh you know and so

2355
01:29:47,939 --> 01:29:52,138
um but you know good weed is good weed

2356
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:54,000
and so I do think that um Mendo perps

2357
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:56,880
isn't a lot more things than people give

2358
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,579
it credit for uh it's a shame that

2359
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,739
philos and others were unable to do what

2360
01:29:59,579 --> 01:30:05,039
they promised which is reveal family

2361
01:30:01,738 --> 01:30:06,359
lineages and ancestry genetically like

2362
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:07,619
that

2363
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:11,759
um but

2364
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:14,819
it is uh it is in a lot of things uh and

2365
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:16,920
it Blends well with a lot of things and

2366
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:20,460
um it adds color and a lot of Terps

2367
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:22,679
we're about to crack the F1 derb

2368
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:25,859
um whole whole thing around that right

2369
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:27,779
now and I I'm I'm putting my odds on

2370
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:29,339
Mendo purpose being an F1 derp I haven't

2371
01:30:27,779 --> 01:30:30,719
really told him that but I'm putting my

2372
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,760
money on it

2373
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:34,800
there's there's there's been an aspect

2374
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,719
of uh people ask me sometimes on the

2375
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,239
lives to talk about the cookie story and

2376
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:42,480
I kind of held off because there's such

2377
01:30:39,238 --> 01:30:44,218
a there's such a juggernaut of money and

2378
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,839
they have these various intentions about

2379
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:49,079
being the biggest cannabis thing in

2380
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,840
America obviously so poking around at

2381
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:53,519
their story you know like they don't

2382
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,279
really care about the truth as much as

2383
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:58,440
they care about the pr of developing

2384
01:30:56,279 --> 01:31:01,800
their brand they have like a massive

2385
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:03,299
brand right and so

2386
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:05,579
um you know things that add to that

2387
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:08,820
brand are positive things that take away

2388
01:31:05,579 --> 01:31:11,939
or or whatever maybe not so much so the

2389
01:31:08,819 --> 01:31:13,039
cookie story is a hard one to tell yeah

2390
01:31:11,939 --> 01:31:16,559
um

2391
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:19,800
you know uh you know money gets involved

2392
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:22,139
in things uh and you know who created

2393
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:24,000
what who's responsible for what

2394
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:26,159
right yeah

2395
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,880
um when you interview him make him break

2396
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:28,879
it down for you

2397
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:33,059
we'll do that we'll do that I have to

2398
01:31:31,079 --> 01:31:36,539
admit the reason why I was curious about

2399
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:39,420
the the Mendo purse question was because

2400
01:31:36,539 --> 01:31:41,340
um it's it's exactly what you guys said

2401
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:44,219
um I like a lot of the work I'm doing

2402
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:46,800
now relates to this very special jelly

2403
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:49,439
breath clone I found and largely

2404
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:52,199
speaking it's just a very Mendo breath

2405
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:54,000
dominant clone and so I've always been

2406
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:56,579
very interested in asking you about that

2407
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,198
because I like through trying this jelly

2408
01:31:56,579 --> 01:32:00,600
breath I'm like man this stuff's amazing

2409
01:31:58,198 --> 01:32:02,039
but I can tell a lot of it's coming from

2410
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,560
the Mendo breath and I can tell a lot of

2411
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:06,000
that's coming from the Mendo perps

2412
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,560
um yeah it's interesting that's that's

2413
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,719
cool to hear the backstory and I

2414
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,940
definitely think that the Mendo breath

2415
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:13,079
performed the best out of the OG KBS

2416
01:32:11,939 --> 01:32:15,419
because a lot of people are going to put

2417
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:16,679
up an argument say Dosey does better I

2418
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:18,480
just don't think Dosey does better

2419
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:21,179
especially considering jelly breath is a

2420
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:23,519
cross of Mendo breath and do-sido

2421
01:32:21,179 --> 01:32:25,560
um I'm very grateful it came out leaning

2422
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:28,620
towards the Mendo breath side the

2423
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:30,539
particular cut that I kept and um you

2424
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:33,000
know the other stuff like Grandpa's

2425
01:32:30,539 --> 01:32:34,500
breath from um dungeon bolts like he's a

2426
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
cool guy it's a cool strain I just don't

2427
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:38,698
think it's quite in that same category

2428
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,619
as Dosey dough or Mendo breath but yeah

2429
01:32:38,698 --> 01:32:43,619
it's it's beautiful stuff man and and

2430
01:32:40,619 --> 01:32:46,079
like I've done a BX on it and I see more

2431
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:47,639
of those sort of Mendo Finos coming out

2432
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:49,979
where I think they're a little less

2433
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:53,520
cookies looking a little more magenta

2434
01:32:49,979 --> 01:32:55,439
and um a bit more cerebral high it's

2435
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,699
really enjoyable yeah how much of the

2436
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:59,039
train wrecks leaking through in that

2437
01:32:56,698 --> 01:33:01,559
from the crystal locomotive that's what

2438
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:04,079
I always wondered and I have to imagine

2439
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,840
that the majority of the Mendo breath

2440
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:09,238
flavor you get is just from the Mendo

2441
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,639
perks because it doesn't strike me to

2442
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:13,979
train wreck at all I've never tried it

2443
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:16,800
the the Mendo I think the I think the

2444
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:18,658
train wreck gives the structure and some

2445
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,900
of the density and some of the crystal

2446
01:33:18,658 --> 01:33:23,819
content invisible Frost

2447
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:26,158
um and I think the color and the perps

2448
01:33:23,819 --> 01:33:28,679
and the and the Terps and the flavor

2449
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:30,420
profiles get dominated by the Mendo

2450
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:32,699
here's one for you

2451
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:35,940
um the original line that was said to be

2452
01:33:32,698 --> 01:33:37,799
used in the Mendo breath was supposedly

2453
01:33:35,939 --> 01:33:39,899
key place that he created it but

2454
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,420
somewhere in my seat I have the original

2455
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:46,138
pack from JoJo of Mendo perps Crystal

2456
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:48,960
Locum so it did exist prior to key play

2457
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:50,520
playing with it that did exist and if I

2458
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,760
have it that means a lot of people that

2459
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:55,380
knew JoJo had it wow so it does still

2460
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,179
exist the original mother stock does

2461
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,980
still exist and is out there of that

2462
01:33:57,179 --> 01:34:01,139
leading back to the Mendo perch Crystal

2463
01:33:58,979 --> 01:34:04,019
locomotive pre-blackberry pie or

2464
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:06,359
whatever the age called it for key play

2465
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:08,040
wow that's rad that's super cool man

2466
01:34:06,359 --> 01:34:10,619
would you ever want to pop him or are

2467
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:12,600
you just like nah I

2468
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:15,238
the last time I tried popping some of

2469
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,699
Jojo stuff was um a friend of ours

2470
01:34:15,238 --> 01:34:19,500
working man gave me some um pure Crystal

2471
01:34:17,698 --> 01:34:21,960
locomotive that he had and I was like

2472
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,880
yeah I'm gonna pop these right now and

2473
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,260
then I like right after popping them

2474
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,760
it's just screwed everything up and I

2475
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,840
was like she's never gonna pop these

2476
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:30,300
things because every time I do something

2477
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,920
screws up but yeah if you're ever if you

2478
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:33,300
ever want to run through them I know you

2479
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,760
like that line I'll send you out some of

2480
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:38,039
that stuff to try

2481
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:40,380
oh you're too kind you're too kind maybe

2482
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:41,939
I could spend a second or two just

2483
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:43,319
talking about

2484
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:45,439
um some of the stuff I'm doing but also

2485
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:47,579
some of the stuff in Australia

2486
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:49,319
go for it yes

2487
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:51,600
yeah like something I'm trying to do is

2488
01:34:49,319 --> 01:34:54,479
sort of help grow the scene and whether

2489
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,460
that be like um you know trying to

2490
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,198
Mentor some up-and-coming people just

2491
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:00,719
you know help avoid make the mistakes

2492
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:02,399
and pitfalls I did or just more

2493
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,079
importantly trying to help put Australia

2494
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:06,359
on the map a little bit and just

2495
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,939
highlight the thing that I think is the

2496
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:10,559
real selling point for Australia is that

2497
01:35:08,939 --> 01:35:12,119
and and you could say this about many

2498
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,940
countries

2499
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:16,679
um we don't have any USA clone only's in

2500
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:19,079
Australia no one has successfully

2501
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:20,880
brought them over and these days I

2502
01:35:19,079 --> 01:35:22,800
actively tell people don't do it we

2503
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,060
don't want the markets the whole blatant

2504
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,639
virus like you don't want to be the dude

2505
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:29,460
who brought that to Australia exactly so

2506
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:32,279
what I say is that the selling point is

2507
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:35,279
that there's a little bit less of that

2508
01:35:32,279 --> 01:35:37,859
same sameness about the offerings

2509
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:40,380
because everyone has to hunt seeds find

2510
01:35:37,859 --> 01:35:42,359
killer mums and I'm now at the point

2511
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:44,279
where I am confident that there are a

2512
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:46,559
few cuttings in Australia that could

2513
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:49,139
stand up to some of the cuts in the

2514
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:51,179
states sure of course you know there are

2515
01:35:49,139 --> 01:35:53,279
some cuts that you know the chems the

2516
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:54,960
TKS like it you know I'm not talking

2517
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:56,819
about that that's the next level right

2518
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,980
but like a lot of the stuff that's

2519
01:35:56,819 --> 01:36:00,359
commonly passed around is clone only is

2520
01:35:58,979 --> 01:36:02,759
like we've got stuff that stands up to

2521
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:04,259
that and the cool part is it's from

2522
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:07,679
people you know like you know there's a

2523
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:10,500
there's a Bodhi cutting that can easy so

2524
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:12,719
that's chem 91 cross to the 88g13 hash

2525
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:15,479
plant there's a beautiful cutting of

2526
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:17,819
that that goes around Australia it won

2527
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:20,819
uh one of the smaller cannabis cups one

2528
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:23,399
year so really beautiful stuff I think

2529
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:26,579
it tends to tap a bit more into the hash

2530
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:31,079
plant components yeah

2531
01:36:26,579 --> 01:36:32,939
yeah yeah it dominates yeah

2532
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:35,519
so also you know what's what's good

2533
01:36:32,939 --> 01:36:39,000
about that though is that the chem 91

2534
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:41,580
and I've talked about this uh before but

2535
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,439
um out of anything you know uh my uh our

2536
01:36:41,579 --> 01:36:44,939
buddy CSI is one of the most prolific

2537
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:47,279
breeders I know

2538
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:50,158
and he said there's nothing in his

2539
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:53,399
collection that passes potency as

2540
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:56,658
consistently as the chem 91 cut which

2541
01:36:53,399 --> 01:36:56,658
chem 91 was in that one

2542
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:59,940
do you know which one was in the Kim

2543
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,060
kisi

2544
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:04,019
uh is the 91 the real one because I

2545
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:06,120
remember there was two different

2546
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:07,080
releases at the cam 91 G13 hash plant

2547
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:09,119
and that's why I was asking I can't

2548
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:11,219
remember which one was named witch that

2549
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:13,260
one had one had the Joe brand cut that

2550
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:16,139
was a diesel and one had the skunk VA

2551
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:18,480
the skunk yeah yeah so I mean I just so

2552
01:37:16,139 --> 01:37:21,179
you know if it adds potency and the G13

2553
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:23,279
hash plan is pretty and Frosty and dense

2554
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:24,539
and more modern looking you know in a

2555
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:26,460
way then

2556
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:27,359
um you know chem 91 is some like ancient

2557
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:30,179
looking

2558
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:32,639
ugly Afghan weed that's [ __ ] ugly I

2559
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:34,079
don't care it's legitimately ugly you

2560
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:36,239
know I mean I think it's beautiful but

2561
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:37,800
like you know it's kind of ugly compared

2562
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:38,779
to Modern weed

2563
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:43,380
um

2564
01:37:38,779 --> 01:37:45,059
leaves during stuff like yeah grows it

2565
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,739
beautiful I have no complaints about the

2566
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,300
way it's going he grows it beautiful but

2567
01:37:46,738 --> 01:37:50,819
I could never get it to perform like he

2568
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:53,100
does at all I just couldn't I mean

2569
01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:55,259
Staten Island he used to joke about like

2570
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:57,840
you know some some of the best runs that

2571
01:37:55,260 --> 01:38:00,960
we had with it every fan Leaf would do

2572
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,639
that and die before Harvest

2573
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,020
and the bud the bud would still be

2574
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,819
beautiful but it would like you would

2575
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:08,179
just be like oh my God for the last two

2576
01:38:05,819 --> 01:38:12,359
weeks of Bloom it's dying it's done yeah

2577
01:38:08,179 --> 01:38:14,520
it's eating itself oh no you know but

2578
01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:16,319
then it would come out fire so it's

2579
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:19,800
funny you mentioned that because I think

2580
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:22,679
most people I know say oh if you want

2581
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:25,079
like a real Benchmark for the chem 91

2582
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:27,719
like try some from skunk VA but I think

2583
01:38:25,079 --> 01:38:30,119
in his mind he would say those early

2584
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:32,100
Staten Island guy harvests were probably

2585
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:33,479
The Benchmark for him in a sense you

2586
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:35,300
know what I mean so it's interesting you

2587
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:38,039
mentioned that

2588
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:40,980
what's funny to me about even though the

2589
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:42,840
chems aren't uh they weren't named that

2590
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:44,279
because they were they were grown chem

2591
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,760
it

2592
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:50,399
um they really do uh respond well like

2593
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,020
my uh Statin used to joke he's like it

2594
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:53,579
really likes GH

2595
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:55,679
you know it really likes General

2596
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:57,359
Hydroponics three-part you know you can

2597
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,980
try all this organic this and that and

2598
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:00,539
everything else and it comes out pretty

2599
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:02,519
nice and then you grow it in three part

2600
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:03,840
and you're like oh my God it's out of

2601
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,280
the park

2602
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,520
um and you know what's funny about that

2603
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:11,279
is he was organic for so long the reason

2604
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,800
why we all started calling it dog was

2605
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:16,979
because he wouldn't call it chem because

2606
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:19,920
he didn't grow chem wheat he didn't grow

2607
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:22,019
candy weed he grew organic in dirt weed

2608
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,539
so he couldn't call his organic weed

2609
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:27,480
chem so he called it you know he called

2610
01:39:24,539 --> 01:39:29,880
it dog chem dog you know and that's and

2611
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:32,039
it's stuck in our little crew in Skunk

2612
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:34,020
VA and I see Collective and me and

2613
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:37,260
Staten Island I mean forever until the

2614
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:39,540
until really the forums it was just dog

2615
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:41,400
someone gave Joe brand according to Joe

2616
01:39:39,539 --> 01:39:42,779
brand his story is that someone gave him

2617
01:39:41,399 --> 01:39:44,339
[ __ ] because they didn't want to give

2618
01:39:42,779 --> 01:39:46,019
him the real [ __ ] and he started passing

2619
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:47,400
it and didn't know that's he from his

2620
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:49,500
point of view that's how it was and it

2621
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:50,759
sounds like from talking to some of the

2622
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:53,039
other guys that maybe it was more

2623
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,900
intentional because Joe Brown's a little

2624
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,698
harder to deal with for most people I

2625
01:39:54,899 --> 01:39:58,799
like the guy he's a great guy no no

2626
01:39:56,698 --> 01:40:01,138
offense from my angle but like they they

2627
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:04,139
had some troubles you know yeah yeah

2628
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:07,380
yeah I mean some of that stuff people

2629
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:08,940
want history and uh knowing a decent

2630
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,560
amount of those people pretty well I can

2631
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:13,259
say that like what's a lot of what's

2632
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:15,420
been publicly told is true but then

2633
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:17,159
there's some interplay between various

2634
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:18,480
friends and falling in and out of

2635
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:20,759
friendships and different things that

2636
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:23,819
happen to different times and some of

2637
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:26,760
that has been I think withheld

2638
01:40:23,819 --> 01:40:29,340
um you know but uh you know and people

2639
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:31,079
miss people mislabeling Cuts people

2640
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:32,880
going through some bad times in their

2641
01:40:31,079 --> 01:40:35,760
life maybe and partying a little too

2642
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,480
hard and letting Cuts get out that you

2643
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,000
know

2644
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:39,959
um and so it never got lost in the crew

2645
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,300
itself

2646
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:44,880
but there's different individuals at

2647
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:47,039
different times that you know

2648
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,840
um may or may not have intentionally or

2649
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:51,300
not passed out things that ended up

2650
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:53,219
being quote unquote fakes that's how we

2651
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:55,199
ended up with seven candies is what he's

2652
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:56,279
trying to say oh no I'm not going to put

2653
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:58,198
that in his mouth but that's what I'm

2654
01:40:56,279 --> 01:41:01,139
saying

2655
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:03,238
yeah no I mean it you know a job you

2656
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:04,920
know it's it's Joe Brands a big partier

2657
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:06,839
you know

2658
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,399
um there was some chaos and and I see

2659
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:10,380
collective's Life at that point in time

2660
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,859
and like that's where my that's where my

2661
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:16,260
not so dog even came from was

2662
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:18,119
um him selling a a bunch of dog to

2663
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:19,739
Staten Island and he couldn't believe

2664
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:21,420
what it looked like and I was like ah

2665
01:41:19,738 --> 01:41:23,459
it's not so dog

2666
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:25,560
um and so it's been it's been lost a few

2667
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:27,300
it's been lost a few times amongst it

2668
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,400
but no but no no none of the four of us

2669
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:31,560
ever all lost it at once yeah let's put

2670
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:32,939
it that way you know so it's been

2671
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:35,820
refurbished

2672
01:41:32,939 --> 01:41:38,279
yeah yeah and and you know and honestly

2673
01:41:35,819 --> 01:41:41,519
too it's like it took we all had it for

2674
01:41:38,279 --> 01:41:44,279
so long before anyone even cared yeah

2675
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:46,260
to you know to be to be clear about it

2676
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:47,939
too it's like before the forums and the

2677
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,380
internet and all that like it wasn't

2678
01:41:47,939 --> 01:41:51,000
famous

2679
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:52,980
you know you know it just kind of

2680
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,139
touches back on the on the the tale of

2681
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:56,879
like you know there are some people who

2682
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:58,920
intentionally obscure stuff there are

2683
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,300
some people who you know whatever but

2684
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:02,579
there are also some people who generally

2685
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:05,360
are trying to get it right that just

2686
01:42:02,579 --> 01:42:08,460
can't for whatever reason because of

2687
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:10,019
past Stories being muddled and that's

2688
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:11,760
just that and that's where it's left and

2689
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:13,739
you can only correct what you can at the

2690
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,020
end you know but there there are people

2691
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:17,939
that are genuinely you know try to get

2692
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:19,560
it right and nail it and then something

2693
01:42:17,939 --> 01:42:21,479
comes out where it's like oh my God and

2694
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,400
and it's how they take responsibility

2695
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:25,198
for it and how they act with it like you

2696
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:26,698
know at the Kim 91 thing a lot of us had

2697
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:28,319
different chem 91 cuts at the time and

2698
01:42:26,698 --> 01:42:29,579
none of us knew we were all passing them

2699
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:31,799
to each other and we all thought it was

2700
01:42:29,579 --> 01:42:33,658
the same thing you know it's different I

2701
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:36,060
mean it can be hard like you want to be

2702
01:42:33,658 --> 01:42:37,738
historically accurate right sure but

2703
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:39,840
then you also because we come from a

2704
01:42:37,738 --> 01:42:42,178
clan design society and like not

2705
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:45,000
everyone you know it wants to show their

2706
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:47,880
face or be Associated or have their real

2707
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,079
name know known with it and so in some

2708
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,639
cases

2709
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:53,399
um you you know you're protecting

2710
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:55,319
someone's wishes you know for the larger

2711
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:58,019
point of their life or in another case

2712
01:42:55,319 --> 01:43:00,118
you might be glossing over some things

2713
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:02,760
that aren't absolutely critical to the

2714
01:43:00,118 --> 01:43:04,679
history because it might paint them in a

2715
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,960
bad light or be personally embarrassing

2716
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:08,520
or not the greatest you know not the

2717
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,198
greatest time in their life when they

2718
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,520
were struggling with something or

2719
01:43:10,198 --> 01:43:14,519
whatever and so you don't want to just

2720
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:16,500
put out gnarly details for the public to

2721
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,060
consume that might like hurt someone's

2722
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:20,340
feelings or something like that so

2723
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:22,380
you're trying to stay as accurate to the

2724
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:25,199
story and as and history as you can

2725
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:27,739
without it necessarily being a grimy

2726
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:27,738
tell-all

2727
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:33,900
let's talk about what you're what you're

2728
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:36,179
working on now like what where what's

2729
01:43:33,899 --> 01:43:39,359
brought you to now what interests you

2730
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:41,760
now genetically yeah great question I'd

2731
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:42,500
love to delve into that so

2732
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,300
um

2733
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:47,100
historically I was really and I mean

2734
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:49,320
even still now but I'll quickly cover

2735
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,300
the backstory on it but historically I

2736
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:54,059
was working with this strain that I

2737
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:58,560
called raspberry Mama it's essentially a

2738
01:43:54,060 --> 01:44:02,340
phantom Kush F2 which is uh an offering

2739
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:05,639
from Ken's GDP okay and it was a cross

2740
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:08,400
of Pink Champagne to Ken's cush Ken's

2741
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:09,659
cush is essentially OG cross to sour I

2742
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:12,539
don't know how they got a mail out of

2743
01:44:09,658 --> 01:44:15,658
that but somehow they did manager they

2744
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:18,479
managed and um so yeah so Crossing that

2745
01:44:15,658 --> 01:44:21,839
OG sour thing to the pink champagne and

2746
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:23,579
then from that I bred it to the F2 and

2747
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,319
tried to just steer it a hundred percent

2748
01:44:23,579 --> 01:44:27,779
to the Pink Champagne because when I

2749
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:29,158
smelled that term I was like man this is

2750
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:30,179
real interesting what was the Pink

2751
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:32,698
Champagne

2752
01:44:30,179 --> 01:44:35,279
Pink Champagne is an unknown clone from

2753
01:44:32,698 --> 01:44:37,379
the NorCal area it came out largely

2754
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:40,380
around the time of About Cherry Pie

2755
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:42,179
probably because cherry pie came out at

2756
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:44,400
the same time it stole the Limelight

2757
01:44:42,179 --> 01:44:46,980
yeah it's very it's a very similar plant

2758
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:49,679
in the sense that it's a very sort of

2759
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:51,658
different Turpin profile like cherry pie

2760
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:53,460
in my mind is is quite a unique smell

2761
01:44:51,658 --> 01:44:56,579
there wasn't too much at that time that

2762
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:58,319
smelt like it and it's got for me Pink

2763
01:44:56,579 --> 01:45:00,479
Champagne obviously has this sort of

2764
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:04,198
champagne component to it so like this

2765
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:05,638
sweet fizzy effervescent quality but

2766
01:45:04,198 --> 01:45:07,439
there's but there's also like this

2767
01:45:05,639 --> 01:45:10,980
really nice

2768
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:14,219
um feminine perfume aspect to it nice so

2769
01:45:10,979 --> 01:45:15,899
and and I think to me cherry pie is I'll

2770
01:45:14,219 --> 01:45:18,779
describe it similar right like there's

2771
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:21,299
like this perfumey component and um

2772
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:23,519
anyway so I'm working with that and a

2773
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:25,440
few people from like um the Bay Area

2774
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,820
remember it and they're like oh yeah I

2775
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:28,919
remember you know Pink Champagne that

2776
01:45:26,819 --> 01:45:31,859
was cool anyway so I'm working with that

2777
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:34,139
it's an F2 and I'm doing my thing

2778
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:35,939
making seeds at that time I wasn't

2779
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:37,560
really putting out much I was still just

2780
01:45:35,939 --> 01:45:40,500
you know doing my own thing figuring out

2781
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:42,719
the ropes and I eventually reversed it

2782
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:45,840
made some Femmes gave those out and they

2783
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:48,899
did okay but then I had to move and I

2784
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:51,420
lost the plan I I didn't have it the two

2785
01:45:48,899 --> 01:45:53,279
guys who I had backing it up they both

2786
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:54,380
lost it thinking someone else had it

2787
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:58,618
yeah yeah

2788
01:45:54,380 --> 01:46:00,480
cannabis stuff right and um and so that

2789
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:02,279
was what then stimulated me to move on

2790
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:04,439
and start looking at the jelly breath

2791
01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:07,319
stuff I mentioned however

2792
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:09,178
about a year ago a good buddy of mine

2793
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:11,698
and another breeder in Australia his

2794
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:13,980
name is feral genetics he's a cool dude

2795
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:16,678
he works with like land race Thai and

2796
01:46:13,979 --> 01:46:19,259
Crosses it to like uh elephant stomper

2797
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:21,239
and stuff like that like cool stuff and

2798
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:22,619
um he hit me up and he's like bro you

2799
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:26,158
probably don't remember but you gave me

2800
01:46:22,618 --> 01:46:27,359
a pack of the s1s you made and um I

2801
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:28,679
hunted through them and I found

2802
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:31,979
something that I think you should take a

2803
01:46:28,679 --> 01:46:34,079
look at and so I went to his house and

2804
01:46:31,979 --> 01:46:36,479
um it was like the original the the

2805
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:38,819
plant I thought I had lost but it was

2806
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:40,859
actually better because the original it

2807
01:46:38,819 --> 01:46:43,198
would just stay green it wouldn't budge

2808
01:46:40,859 --> 01:46:45,019
but this one went purple so I was like

2809
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:47,879
yeah this is like this is even better

2810
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:50,040
and so I've been working with that more

2811
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:51,779
recently because it's come back and I

2812
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:53,939
guess what's interesting is from a

2813
01:46:51,779 --> 01:46:56,158
genetics point of view it's like an F2

2814
01:46:53,939 --> 01:46:58,259
S1 so that's a bit that's a bit

2815
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:00,960
interesting in itself sure

2816
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:03,600
um and then I recently did some

2817
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:08,639
feminized crosses with that and so that

2818
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:09,840
then made the F2 S2 yeah so again from a

2819
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:11,940
genetics point of view a little bit

2820
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,319
different to what you might see I think

2821
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:14,579
it's I think it's very interesting for

2822
01:47:13,319 --> 01:47:16,019
especially like speeding up

2823
01:47:14,579 --> 01:47:18,300
stabilization

2824
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:21,060
yeah well what was interesting was the

2825
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:22,920
majority of the original s1s did not

2826
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,600
come out like the mum so I'm like all

2827
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:26,760
right the mum is a recessive feed

2828
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:28,920
exactly most plants aren't coming out

2829
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,139
like that so when this one was the same

2830
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:33,980
I'm like oh [ __ ] that means both

2831
01:47:31,139 --> 01:47:37,380
recessives have lined up in this one

2832
01:47:33,979 --> 01:47:38,819
yeah and it can only possibly pass on

2833
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:40,618
the recessive trait which means

2834
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:42,420
theoretically most of The Offspring

2835
01:47:40,618 --> 01:47:45,179
should come out with these sort of

2836
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:46,679
traits and not be like like the s1s

2837
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:48,840
exactly so yes I've definitely been

2838
01:47:46,679 --> 01:47:51,118
interested by that and then at the same

2839
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,819
time I'm also working

2840
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:56,939
um the the JB clone into a seed line and

2841
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:58,859
what I did was I initially made so I got

2842
01:47:56,939 --> 01:48:00,359
this jelly breath clone and and you just

2843
01:47:58,859 --> 01:48:02,579
may as well think about it as a cookies

2844
01:48:00,359 --> 01:48:03,658
thing right it's just easy yeah it's

2845
01:48:02,579 --> 01:48:05,340
cookies

2846
01:48:03,658 --> 01:48:08,939
um so I crossed that to this strain I

2847
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:10,380
got from duke which was chem D his chemd

2848
01:48:08,939 --> 01:48:12,238
I know there's discussion around that

2849
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:15,118
but I'll just quickly move on

2850
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:19,039
um here's chemd crossed the Local H and

2851
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:22,259
the Local H is is sour diesel cross to

2852
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:23,639
diesel slash cuttlefish hash plants so

2853
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,739
this I remember a cuttlefish I remember

2854
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:27,239
that one I made s1s of it a long time

2855
01:48:25,738 --> 01:48:28,259
ago oh actually it was a Black Russian

2856
01:48:27,238 --> 01:48:29,819
cuttlefish

2857
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:32,039
that's cool man because like no one

2858
01:48:29,819 --> 01:48:33,559
really worked with it right no it's uh

2859
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:37,219
sunny and me

2860
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:41,580
yeah so yeah so I crossed this chemd

2861
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:44,039
Sour Diesel sort of hybridy plant to the

2862
01:48:41,579 --> 01:48:45,600
the cookies and I ended up like there

2863
01:48:44,039 --> 01:48:47,399
was clear like I'm not going to take

2864
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,920
credit for it it was clearly just

2865
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:52,198
something about those two strains which

2866
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,760
just really clicked yeah like it's it's

2867
01:48:52,198 --> 01:48:56,099
not it's not me I'm not taking credit

2868
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:59,520
these two lines were just meant to cross

2869
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:02,100
together because I did a 40 female Fino

2870
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,560
hunt of these seeds and I found like

2871
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:05,820
eight Keepers I was so surprised and I

2872
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,039
was like man I've got to whittle these

2873
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:09,779
down to just like two or something yeah

2874
01:49:08,039 --> 01:49:11,158
and for the life of me I ended up just

2875
01:49:09,779 --> 01:49:13,259
sort of being like you know what these

2876
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:15,899
these plants are different and they

2877
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:18,360
really do stand on their own feet so

2878
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:20,519
that's been really cool recently to be

2879
01:49:18,359 --> 01:49:23,339
really trying actively to disseminate

2880
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:25,080
those clones out into Australia yeah and

2881
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,760
a lot of people come back to me and say

2882
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:28,198
dude this is the first thing I grow

2883
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:29,940
where I feel like it's on par with

2884
01:49:28,198 --> 01:49:31,618
California and stuff in terms of like

2885
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:33,299
just it's just the genetics it's not

2886
01:49:31,618 --> 01:49:35,099
like me it's like just that's how it

2887
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,900
happens sometimes where like that zipper

2888
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:38,760
lines up perfectly and everything just

2889
01:49:36,899 --> 01:49:42,420
matches it's just how it works it's

2890
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:44,820
great yeah totally so I used that strain

2891
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:46,739
which I call dog jelly

2892
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:49,259
um and I cross that and I use that as

2893
01:49:46,738 --> 01:49:51,000
the initial mail stock to then start

2894
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:54,840
doing the back cross onto the jelly

2895
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:57,000
breath so I then did the bx1 and that

2896
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:59,039
was great it came out very potent it

2897
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,658
fixed up a number of the issues that I

2898
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:02,158
had with my jelly breath clone which was

2899
01:50:00,658 --> 01:50:05,399
like all Cookie strains it's a little

2900
01:50:02,158 --> 01:50:07,679
less yielding than you'd like and um a

2901
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:09,359
little more prone to mold than you might

2902
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:12,060
like because you know those little golf

2903
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:15,599
ball dense nugs anyway that dense is

2904
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:19,679
insane yeah so it fixed up that and um

2905
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:21,600
as a result I'm now just about finished

2906
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,420
I don't know if you can see it that's my

2907
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:26,039
little tent there I uh I have a bunch of

2908
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:29,158
seeded plants in there it's just the

2909
01:50:26,039 --> 01:50:32,399
little tent for seeded pollinations and

2910
01:50:29,158 --> 01:50:33,779
um yeah I got the bx2s being they're in

2911
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:35,939
the oven you know the plants are seated

2912
01:50:33,779 --> 01:50:37,920
they're developing so that's sort of

2913
01:50:35,939 --> 01:50:39,899
largely what I'm doing at the moment and

2914
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:42,000
I think it's interesting because it's a

2915
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:43,618
pretty stable seed line as far as like a

2916
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,479
high quality cookies sort of offering

2917
01:50:43,618 --> 01:50:48,599
because in the past when I had bought

2918
01:50:45,479 --> 01:50:51,419
cookies hybrids admittedly probably from

2919
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:52,980
some less than reputable breeders I just

2920
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:55,380
they're all all over the place you know

2921
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:57,118
I could never get like a cookies type

2922
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:59,340
plan until I had this jelly breath

2923
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:01,859
really so that's sort of what I'm doing

2924
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:03,060
at the moment but the next cycle I do

2925
01:51:01,859 --> 01:51:05,579
because I'm about to head over to the

2926
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:07,260
states come hang out with y'all yeah and

2927
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:09,899
um when I get back I want to do a big

2928
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:13,320
sativa hunt that's where my pumpkin lies

2929
01:51:09,899 --> 01:51:15,118
so Keen to do some sativa work and um

2930
01:51:13,319 --> 01:51:18,539
one of the strains I'm going to be

2931
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:20,880
chucking in there not super sativa but

2932
01:51:18,539 --> 01:51:24,719
um I've got a pack of

2933
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:26,760
Matt riots foreplay oh wow oh wow dude

2934
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:29,520
that so not many people got those that

2935
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:32,280
was the um the the Fairfax four-way cut

2936
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,500
by the elite guys that is a special

2937
01:51:32,279 --> 01:51:35,819
[ __ ] clone dude like I only got to

2938
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,859
see it expressed really well once

2939
01:51:35,819 --> 01:51:39,719
because it it definitely had some kind

2940
01:51:37,859 --> 01:51:41,819
of something but

2941
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:43,439
um we never saw it past any progeny and

2942
01:51:41,819 --> 01:51:45,599
those things that was a skunky plant

2943
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:48,479
dude uh hempilling those guys are right

2944
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:51,060
that is a very special plant that's cool

2945
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:53,819
Yeah man so I'm excited to do that when

2946
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:55,920
I get back get some um some fun stuff in

2947
01:51:53,819 --> 01:51:58,019
the um in the ring but but other than

2948
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:00,359
that I Australian scenes doing really

2949
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:03,420
well we're growing there's a number of

2950
01:52:00,359 --> 01:52:05,759
cool breeders popping their heads up

2951
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:07,440
um I I wouldn't want to do any Miss

2952
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,820
justice but like some of them that jump

2953
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:10,319
to mind immediately are like you know

2954
01:52:08,819 --> 01:52:12,599
we've already mentioned Wally duck who's

2955
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:15,059
like you know a bit of a an older legend

2956
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:16,860
of the same but there's some new cool

2957
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:18,539
upcoming guys I'd say check out like my

2958
01:52:16,859 --> 01:52:21,000
buddy Farrell who I mentioned earlier

2959
01:52:18,539 --> 01:52:23,039
who does like that land race Thai versus

2960
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,719
modern stuff like a cool sort of clash

2961
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:26,100
of the worlds

2962
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:29,520
um another guy who sees I've got

2963
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:31,980
recently uh stinky Jones he's done some

2964
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:33,420
cool work another guy bootleg and then

2965
01:52:31,979 --> 01:52:35,158
another guy

2966
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:37,679
um finally who I'd give a shout out to

2967
01:52:35,158 --> 01:52:39,899
is local bird seed gotta love that name

2968
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:41,520
I love that name

2969
01:52:39,899 --> 01:52:43,319
but yeah so there are some cool

2970
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:44,820
Australian dudes if you're interested in

2971
01:52:43,319 --> 01:52:46,319
just sort of seeing what's going on in

2972
01:52:44,819 --> 01:52:49,139
Australia I highly recommend you check

2973
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:52,019
some of those guys out oh another guy uh

2974
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:53,279
called uh easty's treats

2975
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:54,960
um again I don't want to miss anyone out

2976
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:56,819
I'm sorry if I do it yeah it's hard

2977
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,920
because like you don't miss anyone and

2978
01:52:56,819 --> 01:53:00,899
but yeah no I think it's awesome get

2979
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:02,880
some names out there if you can

2980
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:05,579
but yeah there's cool stuff going down

2981
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:07,199
in Australia and um I think yeah largely

2982
01:53:05,579 --> 01:53:09,238
speaking you'll see me working the

2983
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:10,979
raspberry and the jelly breath stuff but

2984
01:53:09,238 --> 01:53:13,559
the one cool little thing I can tell you

2985
01:53:10,979 --> 01:53:15,419
guys about is where my buddy Farrell

2986
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:17,580
messaged me and said hey you know I got

2987
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:18,719
this S1 you've got to come see it he

2988
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:20,819
also said

2989
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:23,520
what do you think the chances are that

2990
01:53:20,819 --> 01:53:26,939
you had pollen contamination and I said

2991
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:29,280
I I don't think so the tent was on its

2992
01:53:26,939 --> 01:53:33,000
own you know blah blah and he said I

2993
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:35,158
found a male in the s1s and I was like

2994
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,779
okay I've heard of this but like

2995
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:38,819
probably more likely pollen

2996
01:53:36,779 --> 01:53:40,800
contamination than because I think Sam

2997
01:53:38,819 --> 01:53:43,019
said you get like three and a thousand

2998
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,340
or something like it depends on how the

2999
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,159
genetics line up but yeah it's it's

3000
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,199
usually very small yeah so in the back

3001
01:53:47,158 --> 01:53:51,000
of my mind I'm like it could be that but

3002
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:54,178
it could probably more likely pollen

3003
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:57,000
contamination anyway so I've got this

3004
01:53:54,179 --> 01:53:58,440
male raspberry mama and so we thought

3005
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,679
the first thing to do is try to flower

3006
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:05,158
it like let's just see and um this thing

3007
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:06,779
like you you can't make it flour unless

3008
01:54:05,158 --> 01:54:09,479
you fully put it into flour like I put

3009
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:11,279
it in the tiniest pot I could I made it

3010
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:14,099
root bound I put it under 24 hours of

3011
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:16,500
light I tried my last try to stress

3012
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:18,360
induce flour yeah it would not budge

3013
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,219
it's the only plan I have that like

3014
01:54:18,359 --> 01:54:22,439
basically won't even show you it's a

3015
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:23,760
male in veg yeah yeah that's a good

3016
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:25,439
thing for a male because males usually

3017
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,400
just flour at the first sign of root

3018
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:29,158
restriction

3019
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:33,059
I mean to me

3020
01:54:29,158 --> 01:54:36,719
um you know you guys there are males

3021
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:40,020
that appear in in reversals

3022
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:42,179
um the way to really know is like if you

3023
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:43,739
used any pollen from that mail on

3024
01:54:42,179 --> 01:54:47,039
anything

3025
01:54:43,738 --> 01:54:49,379
um and you grew up the seeds uh if it

3026
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:51,899
was a regular if it was regular pollen

3027
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:55,920
then you'd get anywhere from 20 to 80

3028
01:54:51,899 --> 01:54:58,019
percent male female ratio and if it's

3029
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:00,420
you know feminized then you'd only get

3030
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:02,159
female seeds or it wouldn't even take I

3031
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:04,199
mean it might not even be vulnerable I'm

3032
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:06,000
not 100 sure that's really accurate

3033
01:55:04,198 --> 01:55:09,539
because we don't understand the whole

3034
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,920
sexual chromosome nature like the uh I

3035
01:55:09,539 --> 01:55:12,960
don't even remember the proper term I'm

3036
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:13,980
gonna make myself sound stupid but we

3037
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,100
don't understand

3038
01:55:13,979 --> 01:55:19,500
um the whole the whole nature of not

3039
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:21,840
just the sex chromosomes but the what is

3040
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:24,000
it autosomes that that aren't related to

3041
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:26,400
sex chromosomes a lot of those are

3042
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,979
something is having an effect on the sex

3043
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:32,279
chromosomes aside from just the natural

3044
01:55:28,979 --> 01:55:33,959
genetics X chromosomes so I'm not sure

3045
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:35,759
if that really plays out that way I

3046
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:38,698
think what we found out most is that

3047
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:41,699
when there are males and feminized stock

3048
01:55:38,698 --> 01:55:44,279
they tend to be males or females only

3049
01:55:41,698 --> 01:55:47,339
expressing male for whatever reason

3050
01:55:44,279 --> 01:55:49,979
but wow yeah I hadn't I hadn't actually

3051
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:52,619
thought about that I thought yeah that's

3052
01:55:49,979 --> 01:55:55,319
great so so they should test female when

3053
01:55:52,618 --> 01:55:57,599
you test yeah so what my plan initially

3054
01:55:55,319 --> 01:55:59,880
is I'm thinking well I've done the

3055
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:02,039
reversal with like the The Proven female

3056
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:03,779
that we really like so I was like why

3057
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:06,420
don't I just try to make the regular

3058
01:56:03,779 --> 01:56:09,420
versions of those Femme crosses and and

3059
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:11,819
if this thing is in fact you know a male

3060
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:14,100
or a female show like I should get some

3061
01:56:11,819 --> 01:56:15,420
similarities between those two seeds

3062
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:17,880
right see the parents in there right

3063
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:22,679
yeah or I thought alternatively I could

3064
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:24,359
try to do F2 S2 F2

3065
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:26,639
so that would be yeah it'd be

3066
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:28,799
interesting so yeah so just crossed that

3067
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,600
mail to keep the thing now and just see

3068
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,279
what it so yeah it's going to be

3069
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:33,539
interesting to dive down this rabbit

3070
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:36,359
hole because it starts to get a bit

3071
01:56:33,539 --> 01:56:37,800
confusing with the um the lineage but it

3072
01:56:36,359 --> 01:56:40,198
should be interesting and I'm sort of

3073
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:41,760
keen to see where it goes you know DJ

3074
01:56:40,198 --> 01:56:45,299
Short's the king of playing with weird

3075
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:47,100
lineages like Crossing making F1 like

3076
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:48,719
technically what would be f1s within the

3077
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:50,699
same line each gender successive

3078
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:52,920
generation without ever like breeding

3079
01:56:50,698 --> 01:56:54,779
for this specific path or that specific

3080
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:56,520
but it's interesting I think it's

3081
01:56:54,779 --> 01:56:58,698
fascinating and it made some of like my

3082
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:01,260
favorite stuff regardless if it was like

3083
01:56:58,698 --> 01:57:05,099
considered uh

3084
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:07,380
technical or wrecked it ended up making

3085
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:09,420
some really fascinating stuff that I

3086
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:11,219
have no end inside of ever stopping

3087
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:14,158
working with

3088
01:57:11,219 --> 01:57:15,599
yeah yeah DJ's stuff is is killer and

3089
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:18,420
he's he's definitely done more wild

3090
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:20,340
stuff than any of us which is cool yeah

3091
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:21,899
um so what like if people wanted to get

3092
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:23,699
the Australian guy stuff where would

3093
01:57:21,899 --> 01:57:25,799
they go like online where is there a

3094
01:57:23,698 --> 01:57:26,879
place they can get this stuff yeah good

3095
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:29,639
question

3096
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:32,699
um probably about half of those guys I

3097
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:36,060
mentioned uh I stocked it maybe like

3098
01:57:32,698 --> 01:57:38,339
Little Australian seed banks so that

3099
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:39,960
might be one Avenue to go down my my

3100
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:42,000
work is stocked at a seed bank in

3101
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:43,980
Australia called top shelf seed bank I

3102
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,779
know that feral is also stopped there

3103
01:57:43,979 --> 01:57:47,759
and some of those other guys might pop

3104
01:57:45,779 --> 01:57:48,599
up on there but I would always encourage

3105
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,239
you

3106
01:57:48,599 --> 01:57:53,279
um if you were interested drop drop the

3107
01:57:51,238 --> 01:57:54,539
guy directly a message Australia you

3108
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:56,460
know these these guys aren't big

3109
01:57:54,539 --> 01:57:58,319
breeders they're going to be very stoked

3110
01:57:56,460 --> 01:57:59,579
that you're interested in maybe learning

3111
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:01,679
a little bit about what they're doing

3112
01:57:59,579 --> 01:58:03,658
and um I think they would be very

3113
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:05,520
receptive to anyone who dropped him a

3114
01:58:03,658 --> 01:58:08,339
line and said hey I'm in the states and

3115
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:10,199
uh maybe I could try some of your seeds

3116
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:12,179
um yeah I think they would be receptive

3117
01:58:10,198 --> 01:58:13,799
to that so by all means listen to the

3118
01:58:12,179 --> 01:58:15,300
names I mentioned

3119
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:17,880
um and and just type them into Instagram

3120
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:19,440
or or just like go to my

3121
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:21,960
um Instagram and look at who I follow

3122
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:23,819
and they'll they'll be in there and um

3123
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:26,279
yeah drop them a line for sure because

3124
01:58:23,819 --> 01:58:28,198
as I mentioned earlier if nothing else

3125
01:58:26,279 --> 01:58:30,359
you probably have a little bit of a

3126
01:58:28,198 --> 01:58:31,979
better chance of finding something that

3127
01:58:30,359 --> 01:58:34,618
just feels a little bit different

3128
01:58:31,979 --> 01:58:36,479
because we just don't have access to all

3129
01:58:34,618 --> 01:58:40,139
of those clones and so things inherently

3130
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:42,779
have to be a little different and um

3131
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:45,480
I love it I love I loved it that you

3132
01:58:42,779 --> 01:58:47,340
that like I've I've pretty much thought

3133
01:58:45,479 --> 01:58:49,198
about just dropping every single clone

3134
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:50,639
from here on out and only working with

3135
01:58:49,198 --> 01:58:51,598
what I've made out of seed from here on

3136
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,460
out

3137
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:55,500
um I've lost a lot of that love for

3138
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:57,118
finding other people's Keepers or

3139
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:59,340
messing with other things people other

3140
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:01,439
people call Keepers and really really

3141
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:03,480
just looking at what's out there in seed

3142
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:05,399
and just trying to enjoy that some more

3143
01:59:03,479 --> 01:59:06,718
because as Americans we it's really easy

3144
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:08,339
to get trapped in the Clone on the game

3145
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,618
and constantly chasing that next clone

3146
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:12,360
only and that and when you don't have

3147
01:59:10,618 --> 01:59:16,559
when you when you have a constant access

3148
01:59:12,359 --> 01:59:18,479
to stuff like that it it's it's easy to

3149
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,039
fall into it permanently and I've kind

3150
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:22,500
of tried to push myself out of that when

3151
01:59:20,039 --> 01:59:24,779
I when I lost my whole collection

3152
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:27,359
um I I was bummed man that was that was

3153
01:59:24,779 --> 01:59:28,738
a long time of collecting and it and it

3154
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:30,598
pushed me into uncomfortable zone of

3155
01:59:28,738 --> 01:59:32,339
having to pop seeds and it made me find

3156
01:59:30,599 --> 01:59:34,199
that love and all that again so I kind

3157
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:36,420
of Envy a little bit some of that out

3158
01:59:34,198 --> 01:59:38,819
there in Australia that that they they

3159
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:40,880
still have that love for C at night I'm

3160
01:59:38,819 --> 01:59:44,880
glad I get to find that again you know

3161
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:46,260
I think it goes in phases you know uh to

3162
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:48,118
what heavy days was talking about

3163
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:50,099
earlier when people were like breeding

3164
01:59:48,118 --> 01:59:51,960
for what they like

3165
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:54,060
um I think it's we've had a massive

3166
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:56,698
explosion of American breeding going on

3167
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:59,880
but a lot of it has been profit-based

3168
01:59:56,698 --> 02:00:04,138
and so it's been crossing a lot of the

3169
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:07,500
same 30 to 60 Cuts in innumerable ways

3170
02:00:04,139 --> 02:00:09,000
right and you know if you don't care to

3171
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:10,319
sell seed and you're just doing it for

3172
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,060
yourself and your friends you can

3173
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:14,399
literally pick any weird thing you want

3174
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:17,699
and go in any direction you want you're

3175
02:00:14,399 --> 02:00:19,618
not limited by anything in that regard a

3176
02:00:17,698 --> 02:00:22,919
lot of times people are like I want this

3177
02:00:19,618 --> 02:00:24,899
drop to sell well therefore I'm going to

3178
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:27,118
use things that have name recognition

3179
02:00:24,899 --> 02:00:29,819
and I'm going to walk down this path

3180
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:31,979
that's been walked before you know yeah

3181
02:00:29,819 --> 02:00:33,539
um but if you don't care about that then

3182
02:00:31,979 --> 02:00:34,799
the world is your oyster and there's a

3183
02:00:33,539 --> 02:00:37,500
lot of weird [ __ ] out there that you

3184
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:39,539
there's a lot of directions you can go

3185
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:42,238
um if you know and sometimes you know

3186
02:00:39,539 --> 02:00:45,000
maybe you change the game who knows you

3187
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:46,678
know uh it it it uh you know things

3188
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,658
aren't new and you know it's like it's

3189
02:00:46,679 --> 02:00:51,920
just like new genres of music right it's

3190
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:53,638
not Popular until it is

3191
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:56,219
right

3192
02:00:53,639 --> 02:00:57,779
and hugely and and I can hugely relate

3193
02:00:56,219 --> 02:01:01,139
to everything you just said because if

3194
02:00:57,779 --> 02:01:03,300
if someone said to me like right now

3195
02:01:01,139 --> 02:01:04,980
do you think you could base a whole

3196
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:07,440
breeding program off something you found

3197
02:01:04,979 --> 02:01:09,658
in a pack of Kenneth seeds I'd say [ __ ]

3198
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:11,158
no yeah you know what I mean so it was

3199
02:01:09,658 --> 02:01:12,839
the fact that I wasn't thinking about

3200
02:01:11,158 --> 02:01:14,039
that which allowed me to try something

3201
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,840
that I just thought this is a bit weird

3202
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:17,519
and different and then all of a sudden

3203
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:19,319
you find something really cool in there

3204
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,360
and I I try to encourage people to do

3205
02:01:19,319 --> 02:01:23,340
that I'm like grow what interests you

3206
02:01:21,359 --> 02:01:25,618
because you never know what'll jump out

3207
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:27,480
and it could be as you just alluded to

3208
02:01:25,618 --> 02:01:30,118
the start of something which goes on to

3209
02:01:27,479 --> 02:01:32,759
be changes the whole scene

3210
02:01:30,118 --> 02:01:34,198
I mean in the worst case scenario if you

3211
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:35,820
do a bunch of breeding and doesn't make

3212
02:01:34,198 --> 02:01:38,158
any money and a lot of people don't like

3213
02:01:35,819 --> 02:01:40,500
it as long as you can fall back on I

3214
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:42,658
like it yeah right

3215
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:44,960
you know I like it yeah I like it all

3216
02:01:42,658 --> 02:01:47,939
that matters

3217
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,439
right it's so valuable to just have said

3218
02:01:47,939 --> 02:01:51,658
you know I went through the process of

3219
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:54,539
selecting it making the seeds testing

3220
02:01:51,658 --> 02:01:56,399
them and then having the foresight to

3221
02:01:54,539 --> 02:01:58,380
say you know what maybe this is a dead

3222
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:00,299
end but at least I got experience out of

3223
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:02,460
it you know what I mean it's interesting

3224
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:05,219
and being able to say the greetings a

3225
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:06,899
dead end is a valuable tool too that is

3226
02:02:05,219 --> 02:02:08,460
a valuable tool I mean everybody should

3227
02:02:06,899 --> 02:02:11,158
do everybody should realize that most

3228
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:12,420
breeding is failure yeah but I don't

3229
02:02:11,158 --> 02:02:13,679
think that's a comment I don't think

3230
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:14,699
that's common sense to most people

3231
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:15,960
though

3232
02:02:14,698 --> 02:02:18,079
um at least into seed making because

3233
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:22,020
seed making failure isn't making money

3234
02:02:18,079 --> 02:02:24,118
and most of it's about making money so

3235
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:25,800
if they're seeds you can sell them as

3236
02:02:24,118 --> 02:02:27,920
long as you can Market them so it's not

3237
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:30,119
I mean never any sense as you think

3238
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,739
Neville used to have this joke right

3239
02:02:30,118 --> 02:02:35,759
that everything he did with the haze

3240
02:02:31,738 --> 02:02:37,198
past F1 he made it worse yeah yeah you

3241
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:39,900
know he was never able to make it better

3242
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:41,939
like the nl5 hazes and the first crosses

3243
02:02:39,899 --> 02:02:43,439
that they made and did those were all

3244
02:02:41,939 --> 02:02:45,719
better than all the later stuff in his

3245
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:48,059
opinion even though he tried really hard

3246
02:02:45,719 --> 02:02:50,279
you know so sometimes and there's luck

3247
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:52,020
in it you know you could find you could

3248
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:53,819
not find it in a ton of seeds or you

3249
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:56,900
could find it in the first 10 or 15 you

3250
02:02:53,819 --> 02:02:56,899
pop yeah

3251
02:02:57,979 --> 02:03:03,238
hugely hugely and it's um it's

3252
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:06,480
interesting you say that because I I try

3253
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:08,939
to encourage people to also not

3254
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:11,759
um buy into any paradigms about having

3255
02:03:08,939 --> 02:03:13,379
to pop any certain number of seeds like

3256
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:16,020
of course the more you pop the more you

3257
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:17,639
likely but I talk to people who

3258
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:19,320
don't pop seeds because they're like

3259
02:03:17,639 --> 02:03:21,599
well I can't pop 40. so what's the point

3260
02:03:19,319 --> 02:03:24,299
exactly yeah and I'd just say most of my

3261
02:03:21,599 --> 02:03:25,800
favorite like my the jelly breath I I

3262
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:28,320
reference right I try to I try to make

3263
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:30,119
this clear that jelly breath I I you

3264
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:31,738
know you could say it's biased but I

3265
02:03:30,118 --> 02:03:34,679
genuinely believe it's the best cutting

3266
02:03:31,738 --> 02:03:36,919
in Australia and I will be fully up

3267
02:03:34,679 --> 02:03:40,679
front in saying that I got those as

3268
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:43,500
three feminized freebie seeds that's

3269
02:03:40,679 --> 02:03:45,359
cool you know what I mean it's like the

3270
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:47,158
the best [ __ ] can come from who knows

3271
02:03:45,359 --> 02:03:48,960
where and it could be one or two yeah

3272
02:03:47,158 --> 02:03:50,098
the Mendo perps right that was like two

3273
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:53,760
seeds right

3274
02:03:50,099 --> 02:03:55,500
two yeah yeah literally two and uh one

3275
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:57,300
of them was a male so it's the lowest

3276
02:03:55,500 --> 02:04:00,060
possible Fino hunt you could ever have

3277
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:02,340
you know when is that girl one of the

3278
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:03,960
best blueberries I had found in all of

3279
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:05,880
the years of searching for blueberry was

3280
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:08,579
a freaking freebie from dynafin

3281
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:10,319
blueberry hash plant like of all the odd

3282
02:04:08,579 --> 02:04:11,579
things out there that you think you you

3283
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:13,679
know it had some of the best blueberry

3284
02:04:11,579 --> 02:04:16,079
smells up until you know the Bonnet

3285
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:18,239
during that run so yeah it can come from

3286
02:04:16,079 --> 02:04:19,679
anywhere it's so crazy you just

3287
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:21,539
mentioned that because one of the

3288
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:25,079
earliest strains I grew that was

3289
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:27,300
impressive was a dynafem strain we call

3290
02:04:25,079 --> 02:04:28,979
it was called Blue strawberry I think

3291
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:31,079
whatever the blue component like maybe

3292
02:04:28,979 --> 02:04:32,698
the blueberry was the pollen donor part

3293
02:04:31,079 --> 02:04:34,319
in this one as well because I

3294
02:04:32,698 --> 02:04:36,118
specifically remembered oh blue

3295
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:38,158
strawberries world of seeds

3296
02:04:36,118 --> 02:04:40,319
uh it mustn't have been blue strawberry

3297
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:42,299
then it was definitely dynafin but maybe

3298
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:45,118
they did maybe they made a couple of

3299
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:47,159
hybrids with them pollen but yeah but I

3300
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:49,198
also remembered like looking back I'm

3301
02:04:47,158 --> 02:04:51,420
like man how did dinosaur produce that

3302
02:04:49,198 --> 02:04:52,979
like it was pretty good so the Spanish

3303
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:55,020
breeders what I've learned like knowing

3304
02:04:52,979 --> 02:04:57,539
some of them they're [ __ ] good like

3305
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:59,820
that like my buddy um

3306
02:04:57,539 --> 02:05:01,139
Ernesto from from Buddha seeds he was

3307
02:04:59,819 --> 02:05:03,000
one of the first doing making a lot of

3308
02:05:01,139 --> 02:05:05,159
seeds for a greenhouse and Nirvana doing

3309
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,899
the big massive productions for these

3310
02:05:05,158 --> 02:05:08,519
major Dutch companies but in the

3311
02:05:06,899 --> 02:05:10,920
meantime he was also doing Auto flower

3312
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:13,800
breeding and moving Pakistani to trolley

3313
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:15,960
into an Autoflower Forum into like a

3314
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:18,000
reliably true breeding autoflowering

3315
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:19,439
magenta plant and he did it and I got to

3316
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,960
watch him you know go through this

3317
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:25,138
process and they have some serious good

3318
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:27,840
breeders over there and and I think it's

3319
02:05:25,139 --> 02:05:30,480
very easy to dismiss it because what

3320
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:33,060
they sell isn't necessarily what ends up

3321
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:34,379
in the packages of greenhouse meaning if

3322
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:35,760
they're selling in Neville's Haze to

3323
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:37,380
Greenhouse it doesn't mean Greenhouse is

3324
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:38,340
going to stop get his Neville's Haze it

3325
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:39,239
just means that they bought it and

3326
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:41,159
they're going to put it in one of the

3327
02:05:39,238 --> 02:05:43,979
most likely one of those sativa packages

3328
02:05:41,158 --> 02:05:46,618
that best that best fits it you know

3329
02:05:43,979 --> 02:05:48,118
that's how it goes so when people know

3330
02:05:46,618 --> 02:05:49,618
that they make this stuff they might not

3331
02:05:48,118 --> 02:05:51,118
understand that it's being

3332
02:05:49,618 --> 02:05:53,339
misrepresented what's being made but

3333
02:05:51,118 --> 02:05:55,139
they have some fascinating or fantastic

3334
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:57,480
breeders out there fantastic breeders

3335
02:05:55,139 --> 02:06:01,440
and the Spanish that are heavily under

3336
02:05:57,479 --> 02:06:04,259
for what they for sure

3337
02:06:01,439 --> 02:06:07,079
yeah man I I it's interesting how like

3338
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:09,480
the real heads in the Spanish scene are

3339
02:06:07,079 --> 02:06:11,939
not particularly well known in the USA

3340
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:14,759
scene and I think like not at all yeah

3341
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:18,719
and and some of the Clones like um

3342
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:21,840
what's that that one um the queen mother

3343
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:23,760
oh yeah yeah Reina Madre yeah yeah yeah

3344
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,860
like like there's a whole bunch of

3345
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:28,260
clones that are just absolutely prolific

3346
02:06:25,859 --> 02:06:29,880
over there and people who are like in

3347
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:31,560
both USA they're like oh yeah that's a

3348
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:33,300
good clone it's it's not just like the

3349
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:35,039
Spanish thing is good but it's not yeah

3350
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:36,779
and and I think there's another one

3351
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:38,399
called Lily

3352
02:06:36,779 --> 02:06:40,079
I'm not familiar with that one but yeah

3353
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:42,839
okay yeah I think it's from that same

3354
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:45,420
crew it uses that zamo slash Queen

3355
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:47,340
Mother stuff anyway yeah um yeah really

3356
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:48,840
interesting stuff for sure it'd be Keen

3357
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:51,539
to get in there and the more I hear

3358
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:54,719
about La Mano Negros work the more I'm

3359
02:06:51,539 --> 02:06:57,679
like damn I wish we had more clear info

3360
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:57,679
about his life

3361
02:06:59,779 --> 02:07:03,840
Umano real well he was a he was an

3362
02:07:02,219 --> 02:07:05,158
excellent breeder but he did inject a

3363
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:07,260
lot of Dutch [ __ ] into his stuff and

3364
02:07:05,158 --> 02:07:09,479
left that out and that's why it's so

3365
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:11,460
pretty because it is very dutified and

3366
02:07:09,479 --> 02:07:13,138
he did not keep that very clear he was a

3367
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:15,658
good Storyteller and he made some

3368
02:07:13,139 --> 02:07:17,579
amazing stuff but for a preservationist

3369
02:07:15,658 --> 02:07:19,138
you wouldn't I think a lot of the people

3370
02:07:17,579 --> 02:07:21,118
that were around him that liked him a

3371
02:07:19,139 --> 02:07:23,159
lot were were more saddened to find out

3372
02:07:21,118 --> 02:07:24,598
that it was very injected with Dutch

3373
02:07:23,158 --> 02:07:26,158
stuff and left out for someone who was

3374
02:07:24,599 --> 02:07:28,860
such a serious preservationist but he

3375
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:31,079
did make some amazing stuff for sure I

3376
02:07:28,859 --> 02:07:33,059
mean it it goes to to your previous

3377
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:35,698
point in which you were sort of happy

3378
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:37,380
that uh clones from America weren't

3379
02:07:35,698 --> 02:07:39,658
making their way to Australia because

3380
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:42,000
you were avoiding the whole viroid and

3381
02:07:39,658 --> 02:07:44,939
you know super mites and all the various

3382
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,439
uh things that we struggle with but to

3383
02:07:44,939 --> 02:07:49,079
the Spain Point

3384
02:07:46,439 --> 02:07:52,859
um you know International borders and

3385
02:07:49,079 --> 02:07:55,618
customs and oceans are a real barrier uh

3386
02:07:52,859 --> 02:07:58,198
no they're not genetics Spain Spain is

3387
02:07:55,618 --> 02:08:00,420
murder like Spain Amsterdam all of them

3388
02:07:58,198 --> 02:08:03,500
have been murdered by the hlb now all of

3389
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:03,500
them they've been taken out

3390
02:08:03,859 --> 02:08:07,559
there's no good barrier there that's all

3391
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:09,118
I've been hearing about lately is the

3392
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:11,520
Spanish but I just mentioned in a sense

3393
02:08:09,118 --> 02:08:13,979
I actually meant more in the sense of

3394
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:15,719
like you know in America like we don't

3395
02:08:13,979 --> 02:08:17,519
get very we don't it's not like you get

3396
02:08:15,719 --> 02:08:19,079
Spanish strength oh no no you're right

3397
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,880
it's not like you're getting you know

3398
02:08:19,079 --> 02:08:22,439
like like things that he was just

3399
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:26,279
talking about that might be very famous

3400
02:08:22,439 --> 02:08:28,379
in Spain and amazing Cuts you know um it

3401
02:08:26,279 --> 02:08:30,779
took you know there's a couple of the

3402
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:32,940
Neville's uh not Neville's Hayes but

3403
02:08:30,779 --> 02:08:35,219
like a couple of Neville's f1s that have

3404
02:08:32,939 --> 02:08:37,799
made their way to America now but it

3405
02:08:35,219 --> 02:08:40,500
took like 30 years

3406
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:43,320
and most of them aren't over here you

3407
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:46,198
know and so Australia Spain Europe

3408
02:08:43,319 --> 02:08:48,599
America even Canada which like America

3409
02:08:46,198 --> 02:08:51,059
and Canada share a border there's

3410
02:08:48,599 --> 02:08:53,940
there's that border and you know is a

3411
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:55,920
real barrier to free exchange of

3412
02:08:53,939 --> 02:08:57,960
genetics and there's really good things

3413
02:08:55,920 --> 02:09:01,319
in Canada that don't really exist in

3414
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:03,480
America and vice versa because of that

3415
02:09:01,319 --> 02:09:05,279
barrier I'm not so sure they don't make

3416
02:09:03,479 --> 02:09:06,539
it over here I'm not so sure that it's

3417
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:09,118
that they don't pick up because they're

3418
02:09:06,539 --> 02:09:10,319
not popular strains because we've had a

3419
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:12,059
lot of the the Dutch stuff even the

3420
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:13,618
quays was over here I had it but I was

3421
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:15,960
too stupid to keep it you know like

3422
02:09:13,618 --> 02:09:17,639
stuff makes it over but because it's not

3423
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:19,319
popular it doesn't necessarily spread to

3424
02:09:17,639 --> 02:09:21,060
a lot of those Spanish strains have

3425
02:09:19,319 --> 02:09:22,079
weird name like the critical Bilbo like

3426
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:23,760
over here that would sound like critical

3427
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:27,300
dildo like No One's Gonna grow critical

3428
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:29,460
dildo over here right so I mean some of

3429
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:30,179
it is an Aiming convention for sure

3430
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:32,279
um

3431
02:09:30,179 --> 02:09:33,899
but yeah it is it is kind of crazy that

3432
02:09:32,279 --> 02:09:35,340
there isn't more exchange between the

3433
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:36,839
countries even with tissue culture being

3434
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:38,760
more prevalent and stuff that we're not

3435
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:40,199
seeing more of an exchange I don't know

3436
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:43,039
I don't know what that is other than

3437
02:09:40,198 --> 02:09:43,039
naming conventions

3438
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:48,300
and you know what that Segways nicely

3439
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:51,118
into like something I wanted to ask you

3440
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:52,800
guys which is that there's I mean not

3441
02:09:51,118 --> 02:09:55,259
not just now but in recent years there's

3442
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:57,420
been quite a focal discussion around

3443
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:58,860
um the nomenclature or cannabis and like

3444
02:09:57,420 --> 02:10:00,899
how we really need to get with the times

3445
02:09:58,859 --> 02:10:02,399
but there's a part of me that thinks

3446
02:10:00,899 --> 02:10:04,979
that it may never actually change

3447
02:10:02,399 --> 02:10:07,500
because it's just so widely disseminated

3448
02:10:04,979 --> 02:10:08,579
the current language I'd love to hear

3449
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:10,198
you guys thoughts like do you think

3450
02:10:08,579 --> 02:10:12,000
we'll ever have a global reset or do you

3451
02:10:10,198 --> 02:10:13,618
think it'll just continue on and the

3452
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,118
squeaky wheel will keep letting us know

3453
02:10:13,618 --> 02:10:16,399
we're doing it wrong and that sort of

3454
02:10:15,118 --> 02:10:20,399
vibe

3455
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:22,679
I it could change over time I mean I do

3456
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:26,638
think that you know like for instance

3457
02:10:22,679 --> 02:10:28,679
like how in cannabis we use BX uh and

3458
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:32,400
it's not ever used outside of cannabis

3459
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:34,199
it's always BC back cross right

3460
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:36,059
um but I don't know even though it might

3461
02:10:34,198 --> 02:10:37,559
like scientists and stuff might look at

3462
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:40,080
it and laugh at us

3463
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:42,739
we're still conv we're still using that

3464
02:10:40,079 --> 02:10:45,479
word BX to convey the right information

3465
02:10:42,738 --> 02:10:49,019
like people understand what the word

3466
02:10:45,479 --> 02:10:52,019
means you know and so some of that is

3467
02:10:49,020 --> 02:10:54,599
you know I mean I guess like you know uh

3468
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:58,560
you know they they misnamed and you know

3469
02:10:54,599 --> 02:11:00,779
Indica should be afghanica and uh and

3470
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:03,539
you know sativa should be Indica because

3471
02:11:00,779 --> 02:11:05,460
it comes from India and sativa should

3472
02:11:03,539 --> 02:11:07,198
really be rude you know ruderalis should

3473
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:10,260
really you know all that I don't think

3474
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:13,439
that'll ever catch on no I think it's I

3475
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:16,739
think sativa Indica is too ingrained in

3476
02:11:13,439 --> 02:11:18,658
in the in in our subculture

3477
02:11:16,738 --> 02:11:21,118
um and I don't think it'll I don't think

3478
02:11:18,658 --> 02:11:23,399
that'll shift even people that are anal

3479
02:11:21,118 --> 02:11:25,439
about it like me still use Indica sativa

3480
02:11:23,399 --> 02:11:26,759
so I I think you know and then there's

3481
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:29,460
also this thing where you look at some

3482
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:32,400
you look at some stupid seat seed bank

3483
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:36,539
or whatever and it's like oh this is 72

3484
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:38,939
indica and 18 sativa and you're like all

3485
02:11:36,539 --> 02:11:41,760
that's made up yeah I have no idea you

3486
02:11:38,939 --> 02:11:43,919
know like whatsoever so like it it is it

3487
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:46,139
is misleading in a sense because I I

3488
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:48,118
definitely think percentages they mostly

3489
02:11:46,139 --> 02:11:51,539
just pull out of their ass

3490
02:11:48,118 --> 02:11:52,738
for sure yeah hugely hugely and I

3491
02:11:51,539 --> 02:11:54,899
definitely have noticed a lot of

3492
02:11:52,738 --> 02:11:58,198
breeders these days just list everything

3493
02:11:54,899 --> 02:12:01,259
as 60 40 Indica dominant that's a way

3494
02:11:58,198 --> 02:12:03,178
man and you know the confusion the

3495
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:05,280
confusion around phenotype versus

3496
02:12:03,179 --> 02:12:07,260
genotype

3497
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:09,840
um you know some of that kind of kind of

3498
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:11,760
stuff is you know that probably should

3499
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,099
change over time

3500
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:16,139
um you know but I think we're pretty

3501
02:12:14,099 --> 02:12:18,300
well established it we got it right

3502
02:12:16,139 --> 02:12:19,739
um on the last episode I did with uh the

3503
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:22,320
PHD lady I was like hey you know what

3504
02:12:19,738 --> 02:12:23,519
like I want to know am I am I using this

3505
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:25,198
word correctly because I'm not a

3506
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:26,699
scientist I'm not a botanist by trade

3507
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:29,359
you know like phenotype like as I

3508
02:12:26,698 --> 02:12:32,579
learned it genotype are the genes behind

3509
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:34,979
the expressible traits right what you're

3510
02:12:32,579 --> 02:12:36,960
visually seeing are the phenotype the

3511
02:12:34,979 --> 02:12:38,698
visual traits that are expressed this is

3512
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:40,980
the phenotype the genotype are the genes

3513
02:12:38,698 --> 02:12:42,779
behind it you're not you know so I think

3514
02:12:40,979 --> 02:12:45,118
we're using it correctly according to

3515
02:12:42,779 --> 02:12:48,719
her anyways I hope so folks I hate being

3516
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:51,658
wrong but yeah I mean I guess my general

3517
02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:53,340
point is that like we uh but you know

3518
02:12:51,658 --> 02:12:55,500
that that's what cannabis does right

3519
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:57,599
like we take we take these like real

3520
02:12:55,500 --> 02:13:00,060
world terms and then we like

3521
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:02,639
create our own use with them and it's

3522
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:04,440
like what made you know legalization so

3523
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:06,599
hard in some ways is like in Colorado

3524
02:13:04,439 --> 02:13:08,519
when it first went legal they went in

3525
02:13:06,599 --> 02:13:10,679
and took all these suggestive children

3526
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:14,159
names and candy names and trademark

3527
02:13:10,679 --> 02:13:16,560
names off the cookies as cookies because

3528
02:13:14,158 --> 02:13:18,598
the Girl Scouts sued them yeah yeah

3529
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:20,579
right

3530
02:13:18,599 --> 02:13:23,159
um you know and and so we had all this

3531
02:13:20,578 --> 02:13:25,679
Counter Culture tongue-in-cheek funny

3532
02:13:23,158 --> 02:13:28,319
names that played off things that people

3533
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:29,940
knew I don't see any reason why that's

3534
02:13:28,319 --> 02:13:32,219
not going to continue to some degree in

3535
02:13:29,939 --> 02:13:34,019
science I mean we're a pretty subversive

3536
02:13:32,219 --> 02:13:35,578
group

3537
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:39,260
um and our opinion is you should bend

3538
02:13:35,578 --> 02:13:39,259
towards us yeah yeah

3539
02:13:43,158 --> 02:13:47,098
I think it like I I totally agree with

3540
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:49,199
what you're saying and I think it speaks

3541
02:13:47,099 --> 02:13:51,380
to the point of that

3542
02:13:49,198 --> 02:13:53,460
um the purpose of language is not

3543
02:13:51,380 --> 02:13:56,340
necessarily to be a hundred percent

3544
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:58,139
technically correct but to facilitate an

3545
02:13:56,340 --> 02:14:00,719
exchange of ideas where we both know

3546
02:13:58,139 --> 02:14:01,920
we're talking about the same thing and

3547
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:04,380
that's what you're alluding to it's like

3548
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:06,179
we say sativa because we both know that

3549
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:08,880
we are thinking of the same thing when

3550
02:14:06,179 --> 02:14:11,578
we say sativa and I think that's almost

3551
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:13,319
in a sense the manifestation of language

3552
02:14:11,578 --> 02:14:15,299
evolving in front of your eyes it's like

3553
02:14:13,319 --> 02:14:16,679
maybe it's not technically correct but

3554
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:18,420
we know what we're saying to each other

3555
02:14:16,679 --> 02:14:21,658
and that's almost more important to

3556
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:23,460
facilitate ideas being exchanged but you

3557
02:14:21,658 --> 02:14:25,500
know I almost wondered with the the

3558
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:27,658
continuation of the sativa Indica thing

3559
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:29,340
though if it really takes away from the

3560
02:14:27,658 --> 02:14:30,839
effect of the high because I think

3561
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:32,880
that's where it genuinely confuses

3562
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:35,460
people when they go into collectives and

3563
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:37,800
they say I would like a sativa because I

3564
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:39,599
know because this the I'm Jim Belushi

3565
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:40,860
show it told me that sativas give me

3566
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:43,020
energy and I need to go work in the

3567
02:14:40,859 --> 02:14:45,118
garden and that's where you run into to

3568
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:46,739
the problems because just because maybe

3569
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:47,698
it is a narrow leaf type plant doesn't

3570
02:14:46,738 --> 02:14:50,039
necessarily mean it's going to have a

3571
02:14:47,698 --> 02:14:51,719
specific type high so maybe maybe that's

3572
02:14:50,039 --> 02:14:54,238
where the education needs to be not in a

3573
02:14:51,719 --> 02:14:57,658
new whole new terminology but in in

3574
02:14:54,238 --> 02:14:59,279
explaining High types and that's because

3575
02:14:57,658 --> 02:15:00,779
sativa Indica traits don't necessarily

3576
02:14:59,279 --> 02:15:03,300
mean high-type

3577
02:15:00,779 --> 02:15:05,460
I don't necessarily know if that is

3578
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:07,940
gonna be it because I think now that

3579
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:10,859
consumerism and legality is involved

3580
02:15:07,939 --> 02:15:13,799
what you see like in in food and stuff

3581
02:15:10,859 --> 02:15:15,000
like that is people will use like the

3582
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,980
word natural

3583
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,340
like if things don't have a specific

3584
02:15:16,979 --> 02:15:23,279
legal meaning but they convey an idea or

3585
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:25,739
an image then marketers are going to use

3586
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:28,738
them to their advantage sure yeah right

3587
02:15:25,738 --> 02:15:31,559
so you can't say for instance in America

3588
02:15:28,738 --> 02:15:33,359
this is a hundred percent organic unless

3589
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:35,159
it's actually 100 organic because

3590
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:38,219
there's like a federal Rule and you have

3591
02:15:35,158 --> 02:15:40,679
to but you can say it's all natural yeah

3592
02:15:38,219 --> 02:15:41,939
right and so I think that's the naming

3593
02:15:40,679 --> 02:15:44,399
thing that's going to go on unless

3594
02:15:41,939 --> 02:15:46,198
there's some rule against it people are

3595
02:15:44,399 --> 02:15:48,920
going to call [ __ ] whatever they think

3596
02:15:46,198 --> 02:15:48,919
makes them money

3597
02:15:51,618 --> 02:15:56,519
it's why I like to some degree it's why

3598
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:59,639
almost all these strains are candy and

3599
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:04,219
dessert names now yeah right nobody

3600
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:07,078
would name a strain in 2022 the dog [ __ ]

3601
02:16:04,219 --> 02:16:09,539
they would very unlikely name it you

3602
02:16:07,078 --> 02:16:12,359
know Candy Apple something right yeah or

3603
02:16:09,539 --> 02:16:13,920
strawberry or strawberry switch you know

3604
02:16:12,359 --> 02:16:16,679
whatever yeah they would they would

3605
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:18,899
evoke some image it wouldn't be cat piss

3606
02:16:16,679 --> 02:16:21,359
it wouldn't be dog [ __ ] it wouldn't be

3607
02:16:18,899 --> 02:16:24,000
it you know so

3608
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:25,859
um you know it uh indicate sativa that's

3609
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,840
as long as these as long as these

3610
02:16:25,859 --> 02:16:29,219
perceptions persist about what the

3611
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:31,440
effect is going to be

3612
02:16:29,219 --> 02:16:33,840
some of these companies they would name

3613
02:16:31,439 --> 02:16:34,978
you know they would names weed strains

3614
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:39,239
emotion

3615
02:16:34,978 --> 02:16:41,099
yeah you know like relaxation calm you

3616
02:16:39,239 --> 02:16:43,799
know I think you just gave everyone more

3617
02:16:41,099 --> 02:16:45,540
ideas God damn it but you know that's

3618
02:16:43,799 --> 02:16:47,159
that's what happens right like that's

3619
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:48,780
what it's there's there's a capitalism

3620
02:16:47,159 --> 02:16:50,879
part of it

3621
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:53,519
um and we us weed nerds can argue about

3622
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:54,898
it sure you know and then Berner is

3623
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:57,500
going to be out there being like you

3624
02:16:54,898 --> 02:17:01,439
don't want to smoke some relaxation

3625
02:16:57,500 --> 02:17:02,638
yeah all right because you know it's

3626
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:04,200
what sells

3627
02:17:02,638 --> 02:17:07,259
that is

3628
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:09,179
that's interesting can I actually make a

3629
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:10,439
really random comment I think you guys

3630
02:17:09,179 --> 02:17:12,780
will be interested in talking about it

3631
02:17:10,439 --> 02:17:14,639
but I wanted to push myself to express

3632
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:17,099
at least one personal opinion that I've

3633
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:19,079
never expressed before as I was thinking

3634
02:17:17,099 --> 02:17:20,639
about a whole diplomatic thing before

3635
02:17:19,079 --> 02:17:22,519
the show and I was like yeah I shouldn't

3636
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:25,500
be Diplomat I should say something

3637
02:17:22,519 --> 02:17:26,880
anyway it ties into what you were just

3638
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:28,439
saying like about like what we can say

3639
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:31,398
and what we can't say and sort of

3640
02:17:28,439 --> 02:17:34,739
Industry versus standard but basically

3641
02:17:31,398 --> 02:17:35,939
in Australia like I I work in um like

3642
02:17:34,739 --> 02:17:37,439
generally speaking the healthcare

3643
02:17:35,939 --> 02:17:39,420
profession and I used to work in

3644
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:41,040
Pharmacy and I experienced it there and

3645
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:43,260
I experienced it now where I currently

3646
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:46,559
work and what I would really love to do

3647
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:49,859
is encourage people to be what I would

3648
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:52,920
call academically honest about cannabis

3649
02:17:49,859 --> 02:17:54,599
and its effect on people because I speak

3650
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:57,058
to a lot of people in the healthcare

3651
02:17:54,599 --> 02:17:58,920
industry who are not particularly

3652
02:17:57,058 --> 02:18:01,558
interested in hearing about the benefits

3653
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:04,978
of cannabis because for a long time

3654
02:18:01,558 --> 02:18:07,558
they've heard people quote incorrect

3655
02:18:04,978 --> 02:18:09,358
things like Mantra and like the real

3656
02:18:07,558 --> 02:18:11,579
specific one that I sort of have a bit

3657
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:14,460
of a pet peeve with is that cannabis

3658
02:18:11,579 --> 02:18:16,079
doesn't kill people yeah yeah the thing

3659
02:18:14,459 --> 02:18:18,539
that I would say is

3660
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:21,420
first of all I I have a family member

3661
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:23,820
who has um bipolar and when he has

3662
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:26,819
cannabis he goes Manic and becomes very

3663
02:18:23,819 --> 02:18:28,319
unwell sure and so I think we need to be

3664
02:18:26,819 --> 02:18:30,659
honest with ourselves and acknowledge

3665
02:18:28,319 --> 02:18:34,978
that cannabis actually maybe isn't for

3666
02:18:30,659 --> 02:18:37,558
everyone and that's okay because I think

3667
02:18:34,978 --> 02:18:39,239
that the people I speak to they take

3668
02:18:37,558 --> 02:18:41,099
issue that they're told you know it's

3669
02:18:39,239 --> 02:18:43,079
better than anything it doesn't kill

3670
02:18:41,099 --> 02:18:45,478
anyone blah blah blah and I think

3671
02:18:43,079 --> 02:18:47,819
there's stronger arguments we could use

3672
02:18:45,478 --> 02:18:51,000
it's it's not dishonest to say cannabis

3673
02:18:47,819 --> 02:18:53,519
causes less damage both health-wise and

3674
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,260
societally than any other drug that's a

3675
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:58,559
very strong argument and it's a hundred

3676
02:18:55,260 --> 02:19:01,319
percent correct however my my buddy is a

3677
02:18:58,558 --> 02:19:04,079
doctor and he has literally seen people

3678
02:19:01,319 --> 02:19:05,398
die from getting high and walking in

3679
02:19:04,079 --> 02:19:07,739
front of a car accidentally and getting

3680
02:19:05,398 --> 02:19:09,898
hit by a shirt he's seen people who

3681
02:19:07,739 --> 02:19:12,539
present who have only smoked green their

3682
02:19:09,898 --> 02:19:14,819
whole life and they have emphysema sure

3683
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:17,040
and so you have to be honest with

3684
02:19:14,819 --> 02:19:19,019
yourselves that like there are

3685
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:20,939
trade-offs I still think it's the best

3686
02:19:19,019 --> 02:19:23,460
choice by far don't get me wrong I'm I'm

3687
02:19:20,939 --> 02:19:24,898
sitting here heavy smoker myself but I

3688
02:19:23,459 --> 02:19:27,779
just think that we just need to be a

3689
02:19:24,898 --> 02:19:30,420
little more mindful about whether we're

3690
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:33,300
like a bit whether the claims we're

3691
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:35,099
making are 100 genuine and as I said I

3692
02:19:33,299 --> 02:19:36,840
think they're a really strong arguments

3693
02:19:35,099 --> 02:19:39,120
to make that are true saying it's you

3694
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:40,558
know it's less harmful yeah really but I

3695
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:43,859
think that we just need to get out of

3696
02:19:40,558 --> 02:19:46,679
this space of like it causes zero harm

3697
02:19:43,859 --> 02:19:49,920
because the reality is any smoke in your

3698
02:19:46,679 --> 02:19:52,379
lungs long term will cause damage it's

3699
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:53,520
just that simple yeah and um I think a

3700
02:19:52,379 --> 02:19:56,699
lot of people think well it's better

3701
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:58,319
than tobacco and I'd say 100 150 better

3702
02:19:56,700 --> 02:20:00,960
than tobacco but that's not the

3703
02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:02,760
conversation the conversation is that a

3704
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:04,679
lot of people say cannabis has zero

3705
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:06,359
negative effects and I just think yeah

3706
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:07,920
it would be cool if we could all be a

3707
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:10,620
little more honest with ourselves about

3708
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:12,719
like it's not perfect but it's far

3709
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:15,540
better than the other things no question

3710
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:18,139
but um that's my little edgy point that

3711
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:21,240
I wanted to get out there because I do

3712
02:20:18,139 --> 02:20:23,699
unfortunately see the negative impact of

3713
02:20:21,239 --> 02:20:26,280
those statements that you get these old

3714
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:28,320
school you know doctors who are like

3715
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:30,300
well I don't really listen to what the

3716
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:32,520
community says because they they say it

3717
02:20:30,299 --> 02:20:35,879
doesn't cause harm and I can tell you

3718
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:37,920
clearly yeah yeah and so I did want to

3719
02:20:35,879 --> 02:20:40,978
get that out there that we can still do

3720
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:42,898
a great job advocating for cannabis and

3721
02:20:40,978 --> 02:20:44,519
promoting how it's better than some of

3722
02:20:42,898 --> 02:20:48,119
the other alternative recreational

3723
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:49,680
sources of relaxation however I just

3724
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:51,359
think we have to be a little more honest

3725
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:53,639
and recognize that it does have some

3726
02:20:51,359 --> 02:20:55,859
health effects it's not necessarily for

3727
02:20:53,639 --> 02:20:59,279
everyone but it is far better than

3728
02:20:55,859 --> 02:21:00,780
alcohol or tobacco or any of the harder

3729
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:03,479
ones you know and I just think being

3730
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:06,180
mindful of the language we use will

3731
02:21:03,478 --> 02:21:07,858
probably help that longer term to get

3732
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:10,079
some of the more professional white

3733
02:21:07,859 --> 02:21:13,079
collared people to listen to us because

3734
02:21:10,079 --> 02:21:14,639
the reality is we know for a fact that

3735
02:21:13,079 --> 02:21:17,340
the underground Community was ahead of

3736
02:21:14,639 --> 02:21:20,519
the medical community there the way CBD

3737
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:22,079
has helped people clearly shows that the

3738
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:24,359
medical community was wrong they were

3739
02:21:22,079 --> 02:21:27,120
like not no benefit and then like for

3740
02:21:24,359 --> 02:21:29,818
epilepsy Clear Proof undeniable it's

3741
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:32,040
beneficial so I think we want to try to

3742
02:21:29,818 --> 02:21:34,199
maintain that moral High ground and not

3743
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:36,840
seed it by making these sort of

3744
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:38,819
Ambiguously incorrect statements and say

3745
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:40,200
look there's value we've got we've got

3746
02:21:38,818 --> 02:21:42,299
proof of it

3747
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:46,740
um but you know there are pros and cons

3748
02:21:42,299 --> 02:21:49,920
like anything sure I I I I love that

3749
02:21:46,739 --> 02:21:52,079
I think it's probably a reaction at

3750
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:55,439
least in America but probably elsewhere

3751
02:21:52,079 --> 02:21:57,959
too to where it was so demonized by

3752
02:21:55,439 --> 02:22:00,180
society and the government that you felt

3753
02:21:57,959 --> 02:22:01,259
that like talking about it in a nuanced

3754
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:04,079
way

3755
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:06,478
any anything you admitted would be used

3756
02:22:04,079 --> 02:22:08,398
as a club to beat you over keeping it

3757
02:22:06,478 --> 02:22:10,858
right where they wanted it to be which

3758
02:22:08,398 --> 02:22:12,420
was totally illegal and as dangerous and

3759
02:22:10,859 --> 02:22:14,520
in America it's schedule one so it's

3760
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:16,520
right up there with you know

3761
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:19,380
um you know the worst drugs

3762
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:22,800
methamphetamine it's not even it's worse

3763
02:22:19,379 --> 02:22:25,019
than Coke they use cocaine in uh in nose

3764
02:22:22,799 --> 02:22:28,019
surgeries so cocaine is actually

3765
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:31,979
scheduled two in in America because it

3766
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:34,200
has legitimate medical uses right uh and

3767
02:22:31,978 --> 02:22:36,719
uh not that I'm advocating for that but

3768
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:39,420
by any means but I mean you know there

3769
02:22:36,719 --> 02:22:40,978
there's an aspect there where

3770
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:42,299
um it hasn't really been properly

3771
02:22:40,978 --> 02:22:44,459
studied

3772
02:22:42,299 --> 02:22:46,379
for a long time

3773
02:22:44,459 --> 02:22:48,419
um and you know when they did study it

3774
02:22:46,379 --> 02:22:50,519
they were looking for harm

3775
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:53,818
right and so I think we're kind of in

3776
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:55,979
the infancy of balancing out cannabis uh

3777
02:22:53,818 --> 02:22:57,539
one thing you didn't mention you know I

3778
02:22:55,978 --> 02:22:59,459
actually don't think that like you know

3779
02:22:57,540 --> 02:23:01,800
Canada I don't think cannabis has ever

3780
02:22:59,459 --> 02:23:03,478
killed anyone although I do think that

3781
02:23:01,799 --> 02:23:05,699
you're probably right cannabis has has

3782
02:23:03,478 --> 02:23:07,799
made people do stupid things and they

3783
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:10,439
died while high that's probably true

3784
02:23:07,799 --> 02:23:12,719
right um but I have one of my really

3785
02:23:10,439 --> 02:23:14,639
close friends has cannabis hyperemesis

3786
02:23:12,719 --> 02:23:17,579
syndrome right where he gets the

3787
02:23:14,639 --> 02:23:19,260
vomiting and he's had to quit cannabis

3788
02:23:17,579 --> 02:23:21,539
um and it's it's pretty rare you know

3789
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:23,159
but it does exist and everyone thinks

3790
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:25,800
it's name or this or that or whatever

3791
02:23:23,159 --> 02:23:27,539
but he grows his own

3792
02:23:25,799 --> 02:23:29,699
um and he had to give it up and you know

3793
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:31,319
it's kind of like shellfish is amazing

3794
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:33,600
for most people but some people die

3795
02:23:31,318 --> 02:23:35,760
peanut butter is amazing for most people

3796
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:37,559
but some people no not not so much you

3797
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:39,780
know people have allergies people have

3798
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:41,398
different physical makeups and different

3799
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:43,920
genes

3800
02:23:41,398 --> 02:23:45,299
um that react to certain things and so I

3801
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:46,620
agree with you I think it's mostly

3802
02:23:45,299 --> 02:23:48,959
beneficial

3803
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:51,060
but there's it's rare in in the world

3804
02:23:48,959 --> 02:23:54,059
that everything is a perfect good or a

3805
02:23:51,059 --> 02:23:55,859
perfect bad yeah I mean a person

3806
02:23:54,059 --> 02:23:57,420
anything carcinogenic is going to kill

3807
02:23:55,859 --> 02:23:59,159
someone I mean if you smoke it it's

3808
02:23:57,420 --> 02:24:01,020
going to kill you not necessarily it

3809
02:23:59,159 --> 02:24:03,600
being cannabis being the the thing

3810
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:05,340
killing you but the carcinogenic factor

3811
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:08,340
from smoking cannabis is probably what's

3812
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:12,059
really pepper is supposed to be slightly

3813
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:14,280
uh carcinogenic but I'm not sure yeah

3814
02:24:12,059 --> 02:24:16,859
but I'm not sure it says carcinogenic is

3815
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:18,780
burning up uh you know flour or

3816
02:24:16,859 --> 02:24:21,359
something like that but the one thing

3817
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:23,760
I'll say about that is that I don't know

3818
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:27,180
about the carcinogenic aspect of weed

3819
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:29,040
simply because we know that tens of

3820
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:31,800
millions of Americans have smoked it

3821
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:35,160
every day and plenty of other countries

3822
02:24:31,799 --> 02:24:38,279
right and in America we lose like half a

3823
02:24:35,159 --> 02:24:40,739
million people a year to Tobacco illness

3824
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:43,620
and they haven't been able to pin cancer

3825
02:24:40,739 --> 02:24:45,000
on cannabis despite trying extremely

3826
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:47,220
hard

3827
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,780
um and so I think that one is still up

3828
02:24:47,219 --> 02:24:50,760
for debate

3829
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:53,520
um I agree it has a lot of tar I agree

3830
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:56,340
it has a lot of carcinogens uh in it

3831
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,020
yeah

3832
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:59,939
but you know you would think that if

3833
02:24:58,020 --> 02:25:02,760
tens of millions of Americans have

3834
02:24:59,939 --> 02:25:05,818
smoked it daily for years that you would

3835
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:06,800
have a lot of them would get sick and

3836
02:25:05,818 --> 02:25:10,019
die

3837
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:11,639
and we haven't seen that yet so I think

3838
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:13,560
it remains to be seen

3839
02:25:11,639 --> 02:25:15,180
because it isn't necessarily a proven

3840
02:25:13,559 --> 02:25:18,180
correlation doesn't mean it hasn't been

3841
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:20,220
seen oh I agree you know and I also

3842
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:22,559
think I'll throw this out there to to go

3843
02:25:20,219 --> 02:25:26,879
on to heavy dazes Point

3844
02:25:22,559 --> 02:25:29,100
um I think that smoking flour itself out

3845
02:25:26,879 --> 02:25:31,139
of the traditional ways in bongs or

3846
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:33,840
bowls or joints or whatever has been

3847
02:25:31,139 --> 02:25:35,519
well studied for a long time

3848
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,939
um and I think that it's generally

3849
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:41,880
pretty safe I don't know if all of the

3850
02:25:38,939 --> 02:25:44,040
modern dab and extracts and all these

3851
02:25:41,879 --> 02:25:46,019
other Goos that people are smoking all

3852
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:48,720
the time I don't know if those are going

3853
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:51,180
to end up being as safe

3854
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:54,000
um and I think that you know people are

3855
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:57,420
saying oh it's cannabis so it's all safe

3856
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:59,939
right but we also haven't had years and

3857
02:25:57,420 --> 02:26:02,040
years and years of people using it yet

3858
02:25:59,939 --> 02:26:04,680
to see what the effects might be later

3859
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:06,720
on I think this is a great example three

3860
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:09,300
different eras right here of of the

3861
02:26:06,719 --> 02:26:12,299
modern era the mid-era and the old era

3862
02:26:09,299 --> 02:26:14,159
of life I mean different pushbacks to

3863
02:26:12,299 --> 02:26:16,379
use a perfect example I remember when

3864
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:18,059
all my I'm not that into hash but I

3865
02:26:16,379 --> 02:26:21,239
remember when a lot of my friends would

3866
02:26:18,059 --> 02:26:24,420
smoke their Dabs out of glowing Cherry

3867
02:26:21,239 --> 02:26:27,719
bangers yeah we now know if you're

3868
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:30,059
smoking hash at 800 and 900 Degrees it's

3869
02:26:27,719 --> 02:26:32,699
creating cyanide it's creating various

3870
02:26:30,059 --> 02:26:34,500
carcinogens it's really unhealthy and no

3871
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:38,780
one does that anymore because that [ __ ]

3872
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:38,780
is [ __ ] yeah but yes

3873
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:44,880
but everyone I knew back then was like

3874
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:47,399
heating a torch until that thing was

3875
02:26:44,879 --> 02:26:49,259
glowing red and then dropping goo in it

3876
02:26:47,398 --> 02:26:50,639
and taking big hits and coughing until

3877
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:52,760
they couldn't breathe

3878
02:26:50,639 --> 02:26:56,099
it's probably not the best

3879
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:57,420
yeah no look I'm so I'm so stoked you

3880
02:26:56,100 --> 02:26:58,920
guys brought those points up because I

3881
02:26:57,420 --> 02:27:01,379
think I could probably add a few little

3882
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:03,600
tidbits of info so in terms of when

3883
02:27:01,379 --> 02:27:06,000
you're smoking green plant matter like

3884
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:08,939
there's no tobacco in there they've

3885
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:11,520
actually shown that across the board

3886
02:27:08,939 --> 02:27:13,559
most plant matter when you combust it it

3887
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:16,319
turns into this molecule called four

3888
02:27:13,559 --> 02:27:19,260
four bypyridine which is basically a

3889
02:27:16,318 --> 02:27:21,719
relatively benign molecule and this is

3890
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:24,059
why cannabis doesn't appear to increase

3891
02:27:21,719 --> 02:27:26,879
your rate of cancer per se because the

3892
02:27:24,059 --> 02:27:29,519
molecules it turns into is pretty benign

3893
02:27:26,879 --> 02:27:32,039
um what's interesting is when you smoke

3894
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:34,500
cannabis as you mentioned it produces

3895
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:36,479
more tar than the equivalent volume of

3896
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:38,398
tobacco so that one gram of cannabis

3897
02:27:36,478 --> 02:27:40,739
actually makes more tar the difference

3898
02:27:38,398 --> 02:27:42,239
is is that when you smoke cannabis in

3899
02:27:40,739 --> 02:27:44,818
your throat you have this thing called

3900
02:27:42,239 --> 02:27:46,859
the mucousillery elevator it's basically

3901
02:27:44,818 --> 02:27:49,559
like the little hairs that brush the

3902
02:27:46,859 --> 02:27:51,840
dust up out of your lungs and stops your

3903
02:27:49,559 --> 02:27:53,100
lungs from getting filled with Gunk and

3904
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:56,280
what happens is when you swim my

3905
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:58,800
cannabis that become those hairs they

3906
02:27:56,280 --> 02:28:01,079
become paralyzed but after a few hours

3907
02:27:58,799 --> 02:28:03,179
they start back up and you can clear

3908
02:28:01,079 --> 02:28:05,459
that tar out so it's not actually a big

3909
02:28:03,180 --> 02:28:07,500
deal even though people do like to point

3910
02:28:05,459 --> 02:28:09,358
out that cannabis produces more tar your

3911
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:10,978
body can get rid of it it sweeps it up

3912
02:28:09,359 --> 02:28:13,020
you don't recognize it goes down your

3913
02:28:10,978 --> 02:28:14,639
esophagus and you just swallow it and it

3914
02:28:13,020 --> 02:28:16,800
comes out the other end what's

3915
02:28:14,639 --> 02:28:19,500
interesting though is with tobacco it

3916
02:28:16,799 --> 02:28:21,898
actually kills those hairs and the hairs

3917
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:23,520
take at least two weeks to grow back so

3918
02:28:21,898 --> 02:28:26,039
as a result unless you abstain from

3919
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:27,899
smoking tobacco for two weeks that tar

3920
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:29,939
will accumulate in your lungs and even

3921
02:28:27,898 --> 02:28:31,920
though it's less than cannabis your body

3922
02:28:29,939 --> 02:28:33,659
can't get rid of it so that's an

3923
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:35,340
interesting sort of thing to keep in

3924
02:28:33,659 --> 02:28:36,898
your stash because people love to [ __ ]

3925
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:38,340
on cannabis and say there's more tar and

3926
02:28:36,898 --> 02:28:41,279
it's like yeah a bit sort of not

3927
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:42,359
actually an issue interestingly when we

3928
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:45,600
look at

3929
02:28:42,359 --> 02:28:47,159
the carcinogen aspect of cannabis that

3930
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:49,439
you're right there's no proven

3931
02:28:47,159 --> 02:28:51,898
carcinogen like it's it's not going to

3932
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:54,420
give you lung cancer per se but what is

3933
02:28:51,898 --> 02:28:56,340
interesting is that when you inhale any

3934
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:59,280
smoke it essentially causes the

3935
02:28:56,340 --> 02:29:01,739
breakdown of the alveoli which long term

3936
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:04,319
is what we would call emphysema and

3937
02:29:01,739 --> 02:29:06,600
emphysema long term will turn into

3938
02:29:04,318 --> 02:29:08,159
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

3939
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:10,920
COPD

3940
02:29:08,159 --> 02:29:13,799
so the way I try to explain it to people

3941
02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:16,379
is you might think of um being exposed

3942
02:29:13,799 --> 02:29:18,959
to Asbestos and you and you could say

3943
02:29:16,379 --> 02:29:21,420
well it's not actually the asbestos that

3944
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:23,699
kills you asbestos causes mesothelioma

3945
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:25,978
and it is the mesothelioma that kills

3946
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:28,079
you and so I actually view it the same

3947
02:29:25,978 --> 02:29:31,079
way with cannabis cannabis doesn't kill

3948
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:33,719
you but it causes COPD and COPD will

3949
02:29:31,079 --> 02:29:35,939
kill you so I think it's just about like

3950
02:29:33,719 --> 02:29:38,099
sort of keeping it in perspective sort

3951
02:29:35,939 --> 02:29:39,720
of because a lot of people yeah it's

3952
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:42,540
it's hard to understand that it can kill

3953
02:29:39,719 --> 02:29:44,938
you but I because I myself used to say

3954
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:46,979
well I've never met anyone who smoked

3955
02:29:44,939 --> 02:29:48,720
pure green their whole life so it's sort

3956
02:29:46,978 --> 02:29:51,478
of hard to know because most people have

3957
02:29:48,719 --> 02:29:52,978
smoked a decent amount of tobacco so

3958
02:29:51,478 --> 02:29:55,559
it's just like it's just muddled and

3959
02:29:52,978 --> 02:29:58,619
it's like well how do you know by the

3960
02:29:55,559 --> 02:30:00,659
correlation thing because yeah yeah but

3961
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:02,520
but I have bumped into a few British

3962
02:30:00,659 --> 02:30:04,559
guys who reckon they've just smoked

3963
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:07,260
green their whole life and and they do

3964
02:30:04,559 --> 02:30:10,260
have emphysema so so it is interesting

3965
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:12,780
but but like I guess on this point I

3966
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:15,180
I've cut my usage back so that I tend to

3967
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:16,800
just consume in the evening and I think

3968
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:18,479
this has actually been really beneficial

3969
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:21,358
for just my own personal health maybe

3970
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:23,459
this is a very specific thing to me but

3971
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:25,920
but I feel like

3972
02:30:23,459 --> 02:30:28,559
um you know not having brekki bongs so

3973
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:30,478
to speak for me personally has been

3974
02:30:28,559 --> 02:30:32,340
quite beneficial and I feel like my

3975
02:30:30,478 --> 02:30:34,858
respiratory

3976
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:37,318
um capacity essentially has been better

3977
02:30:34,859 --> 02:30:40,020
for that and I would just encourage

3978
02:30:37,318 --> 02:30:41,879
people to to just be mindful of this in

3979
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:44,280
the long term because you know

3980
02:30:41,879 --> 02:30:46,858
unfortunately COPD is a bit of a rough

3981
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:48,899
one and um you know it would be better

3982
02:30:46,859 --> 02:30:50,818
to avoid it if possible but it is

3983
02:30:48,898 --> 02:30:52,199
interesting yeah the 4-4 by pyridine

3984
02:30:50,818 --> 02:30:54,119
thing I'd encourage people to look into

3985
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:56,700
it it's pretty benign

3986
02:30:54,120 --> 02:30:58,140
um and and yeah overall clearly smoking

3987
02:30:56,700 --> 02:31:00,060
weed is way better than tobacco right

3988
02:30:58,139 --> 02:31:02,760
like there's just no question about it

3989
02:31:00,059 --> 02:31:06,478
is it the Nicki or tobacco that's

3990
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:09,420
causing the um the stuff in your lungs

3991
02:31:06,478 --> 02:31:11,699
to freeze we don't know yet probably

3992
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:14,398
because it has it's Vapes are so young

3993
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:17,520
nicotine and tobacco are always mixed in

3994
02:31:14,398 --> 02:31:19,318
the same thing right yeah I mean yes I

3995
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:21,359
saw this big study and I can't say what

3996
02:31:19,318 --> 02:31:22,680
it is right now I apologize but I did

3997
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:26,220
see this thing where it was like they

3998
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:29,939
studied a huge amount of non-smokers

3999
02:31:26,219 --> 02:31:32,579
weed smokers only weed and tobacco and

4000
02:31:29,939 --> 02:31:37,020
just tobacco and the highest rate of

4001
02:31:32,579 --> 02:31:39,659
lung cancer was tobacco followed by weed

4002
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:43,439
and tobacco but then strangely the

4003
02:31:39,659 --> 02:31:45,959
control group the normal lung cancer was

4004
02:31:43,439 --> 02:31:47,818
third and the people that had the least

4005
02:31:45,959 --> 02:31:50,099
amount of lung cancer were the people

4006
02:31:47,818 --> 02:31:53,459
that smoked cannabis only

4007
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:55,079
yeah um but as heavy days says you know

4008
02:31:53,459 --> 02:31:56,818
just because it protects you from one

4009
02:31:55,079 --> 02:31:59,398
thing doesn't mean it doesn't increase

4010
02:31:56,818 --> 02:32:01,318
your risk for something else to come

4011
02:31:59,398 --> 02:32:03,840
along and harm you

4012
02:32:01,318 --> 02:32:06,059
um you know uh and so a lot of times we

4013
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:08,219
oversimplify things by being like see it

4014
02:32:06,059 --> 02:32:10,439
prevents this so it's all good I've seen

4015
02:32:08,219 --> 02:32:12,898
that it causes this so it's so it's all

4016
02:32:10,439 --> 02:32:16,020
bad I've seen that with CBD in the USA

4017
02:32:12,898 --> 02:32:18,420
it's it's a literal snake oil show here

4018
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:20,520
with CBD literally it is being sold in

4019
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:22,859
every gas station now like in at least

4020
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:26,399
in my area every gas station carries

4021
02:32:22,859 --> 02:32:28,079
some sort of CBD Contraption or uh CBD

4022
02:32:26,398 --> 02:32:30,779
flower even they sell everywhere you

4023
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:33,359
know and it's being sold like if you

4024
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:35,220
talk to like you know my chicks parents

4025
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:38,040
or whoever they really have this idea

4026
02:32:35,219 --> 02:32:40,978
that CBD cures everything every last

4027
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:43,080
thing there's this weird thing that we

4028
02:32:40,978 --> 02:32:44,579
won't know for probably decades but like

4029
02:32:43,079 --> 02:32:46,200
since you're in the in the medical

4030
02:32:44,579 --> 02:32:48,420
profession maybe some you know people

4031
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:50,040
are going to push it along but you know

4032
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:52,139
these guys in Israel we legitimate

4033
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:54,180
definitely have a cannabinoid system

4034
02:32:52,139 --> 02:32:58,199
right

4035
02:32:54,180 --> 02:33:00,479
um in our body and CBD and THC interacts

4036
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:03,300
with that cannabinoid system and it's

4037
02:33:00,478 --> 02:33:04,679
pretty unstudied and we don't exactly

4038
02:33:03,299 --> 02:33:07,438
know

4039
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:09,659
um what how you know what it affects you

4040
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:11,159
know it's it's one of the body systems

4041
02:33:09,659 --> 02:33:13,260
that I think is the most poorly

4042
02:33:11,159 --> 02:33:16,318
understood because they only discovered

4043
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:18,059
it in the late 80s early 90s and they

4044
02:33:16,318 --> 02:33:20,398
don't know how cannabis and CBD

4045
02:33:18,059 --> 02:33:22,079
interacts with your you know your

4046
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:24,059
cannabinoid system or even what your

4047
02:33:22,079 --> 02:33:27,059
cannabinoid system totally does in

4048
02:33:24,059 --> 02:33:30,779
relationship to the rest of your body

4049
02:33:27,059 --> 02:33:32,279
um so I think people uh forget that you

4050
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:34,260
know we know a lot

4051
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:36,720
but that you know we only figured out

4052
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:38,939
what bacteria was like 130 years ago or

4053
02:33:36,719 --> 02:33:42,000
something and we still have a vast

4054
02:33:38,939 --> 02:33:43,739
amount of of things to learn and we're

4055
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:46,379
going to be surprised

4056
02:33:43,739 --> 02:33:48,000
you know yeah when I was when I was a

4057
02:33:46,379 --> 02:33:49,858
kid heavy days

4058
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:53,299
um they they told everyone that that

4059
02:33:49,859 --> 02:33:55,800
margarine was clearly Superior to butter

4060
02:33:53,299 --> 02:33:59,398
now they have a much different opinion

4061
02:33:55,799 --> 02:34:01,679
of trans fatty acids you know

4062
02:33:59,398 --> 02:34:03,898
um you know people have things change

4063
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:07,020
new evidence comes in and it changes

4064
02:34:03,898 --> 02:34:08,760
people's perspectives so you know I

4065
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:10,880
don't know where it's gonna lead but I

4066
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:14,159
do think it's be it's being studied now

4067
02:34:10,879 --> 02:34:16,559
more than in any time in our history so

4068
02:34:14,159 --> 02:34:19,379
I would imagine over the next 20 or 30

4069
02:34:16,559 --> 02:34:21,719
years will probably be a golden era of

4070
02:34:19,379 --> 02:34:23,539
discovering how cannabis interacts with

4071
02:34:21,719 --> 02:34:26,699
human beings

4072
02:34:23,540 --> 02:34:29,399
yeah hugely hugely and I I totally agree

4073
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:32,220
with you I am 100 on the fence and

4074
02:34:29,398 --> 02:34:33,840
almost anticipating the worst with these

4075
02:34:32,219 --> 02:34:36,299
long-term bait studies coming out

4076
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:38,398
because I I agree we totally do not it

4077
02:34:36,299 --> 02:34:40,920
like I'll be honest I switched from

4078
02:34:38,398 --> 02:34:43,139
bongs to Vapes like a bit over two years

4079
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:46,079
ago thinking I was you know doing it for

4080
02:34:43,139 --> 02:34:48,420
my health and as time goes by I'm like

4081
02:34:46,079 --> 02:34:49,680
man am I about to like get cancer and

4082
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:51,239
they find out like oh it turns out

4083
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:53,340
vaping's like Wayward like you know what

4084
02:34:51,239 --> 02:34:55,439
I mean like something really concerning

4085
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:57,719
but just to add one little extra little

4086
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:58,979
study Tibet in there they they did a

4087
02:34:57,719 --> 02:35:02,279
different study where they tried to

4088
02:34:58,978 --> 02:35:04,019
assess the lung function of um just pure

4089
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:05,819
cannabis smokers and what they basically

4090
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:08,220
found was if you look at lung function

4091
02:35:05,818 --> 02:35:10,920
we tend to use these two measures one's

4092
02:35:08,219 --> 02:35:12,599
called fev1 which stands for how quickly

4093
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:15,659
can you push all the air out of your

4094
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:17,520
lungs so forced expiratory volume and we

4095
02:35:15,659 --> 02:35:19,020
tend to look at it over one second so

4096
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:21,300
how much can you push out in one second

4097
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:23,159
and then the other one is how much can

4098
02:35:21,299 --> 02:35:25,619
you hold in total which is your Force by

4099
02:35:23,159 --> 02:35:27,959
model capacity basically what they found

4100
02:35:25,620 --> 02:35:29,760
was is that the people who had like

4101
02:35:27,959 --> 02:35:32,219
older and had smoked cannabis their

4102
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:35,100
whole lives they had slightly smaller

4103
02:35:32,219 --> 02:35:37,379
overall capacity which meant like there

4104
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:40,079
was some degree of emphysema there but

4105
02:35:37,379 --> 02:35:41,279
they actually had a better fev-1 which

4106
02:35:40,079 --> 02:35:43,020
is sort of the more one you're

4107
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:45,180
interested in actually because what they

4108
02:35:43,020 --> 02:35:48,060
basically found was a lifetime of

4109
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:51,780
ripping bongs actually strengthens your

4110
02:35:48,059 --> 02:35:53,639
lungs that's [ __ ] hilarious I'm not

4111
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:55,859
even kidding and like they were

4112
02:35:53,639 --> 02:35:58,139
basically like they found a lifetime of

4113
02:35:55,859 --> 02:35:59,700
ripping cones gave you the same benefits

4114
02:35:58,139 --> 02:36:01,559
as someone who was like a diver their

4115
02:35:59,700 --> 02:36:04,260
whole life who worked at holding their

4116
02:36:01,559 --> 02:36:06,600
breath and like there's real benefits

4117
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:07,978
associated with it and they basically

4118
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:10,260
were like yeah like a little bit less

4119
02:36:07,978 --> 02:36:12,959
total volume but like your use of the

4120
02:36:10,260 --> 02:36:13,978
space is superior to someone who hasn't

4121
02:36:12,959 --> 02:36:15,959
smoked

4122
02:36:13,978 --> 02:36:18,599
that's might be my favorite part of the

4123
02:36:15,959 --> 02:36:21,179
whole interview uh that I've been I've

4124
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:23,720
been training my whole life just

4125
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:23,720
dedicated

4126
02:36:23,959 --> 02:36:29,039
I I smoke you know bongs or what that's

4127
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:31,020
my primary delivery system

4128
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:33,359
it's the one I find the most convenient

4129
02:36:31,020 --> 02:36:35,960
mm-hmm yeah I like to see the shape the

4130
02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:38,818
shapes of his bunks are very phallic

4131
02:36:35,959 --> 02:36:40,438
they tend to be that way they do they

4132
02:36:38,818 --> 02:36:43,978
tend to be phallic you know they tend to

4133
02:36:40,439 --> 02:36:46,340
be a tube with a bass you know so so it

4134
02:36:43,978 --> 02:36:48,299
ergonomically fits in the mouth yeah

4135
02:36:46,340 --> 02:36:50,159
ergonomics it just slides right in

4136
02:36:48,299 --> 02:36:52,619
you'll see it you'll see it when you

4137
02:36:50,159 --> 02:36:55,079
come when coming you have to know heavy

4138
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:58,620
days that once every episode

4139
02:36:55,079 --> 02:37:00,359
Matt tries to get me to Break by

4140
02:36:58,620 --> 02:37:03,060
throwing out usually some kind of

4141
02:37:00,359 --> 02:37:05,939
phallic reference and tries to get me to

4142
02:37:03,059 --> 02:37:07,680
crack better throw me off my train of

4143
02:37:05,939 --> 02:37:09,180
thought so he was running out of time

4144
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:10,340
and he probably realized he needed to

4145
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:13,859
get it in

4146
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:15,978
I love that I I'm trying to be cognizant

4147
02:37:13,859 --> 02:37:19,979
of the time

4148
02:37:15,978 --> 02:37:21,478
we could do I always remembered um when

4149
02:37:19,978 --> 02:37:23,039
I interviewed Bodhi he did something

4150
02:37:21,478 --> 02:37:24,959
very different and he was like I would

4151
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:26,939
love to give people some um book

4152
02:37:24,959 --> 02:37:28,438
recommendations is there any chance I

4153
02:37:26,939 --> 02:37:30,659
might be able to do that do that let's

4154
02:37:28,439 --> 02:37:32,040
do it yes please cool cool so I've

4155
02:37:30,659 --> 02:37:33,840
always thought if I could recommend a

4156
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:35,819
few books to people like not necessarily

4157
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:37,559
cannabis specific but just no just

4158
02:37:35,818 --> 02:37:39,180
things that are good reads

4159
02:37:37,559 --> 02:37:41,939
um so I think one of the most

4160
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:43,318
influential books in my life

4161
02:37:41,939 --> 02:37:45,780
um is definitely one called the body

4162
02:37:43,318 --> 02:37:49,199
keeps the score by Bessel vanderkolk

4163
02:37:45,780 --> 02:37:51,300
it's a book largely speaking about

4164
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:53,399
um people who have trauma and how you

4165
02:37:51,299 --> 02:37:54,719
can help them overcome that and I think

4166
02:37:53,398 --> 02:37:56,039
that it's very interesting because it

4167
02:37:54,719 --> 02:37:57,599
speaks to about how a lot of

4168
02:37:56,040 --> 02:37:59,520
psychological problems manifest

4169
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:01,859
physically you hear people talking about

4170
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:03,359
tents in the shoulders and anyway it was

4171
02:38:01,859 --> 02:38:05,460
a seminal literature when it came out

4172
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:07,079
the body keeps the score Bessel Van Der

4173
02:38:05,459 --> 02:38:10,079

4179
02:38:19,978 --> 02:38:25,318
consider that one I've recently really

4180
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:28,560
gotten into rum dust and I like walking

4181
02:38:25,318 --> 02:38:30,299
each other home and becoming nobody me

4182
02:38:28,559 --> 02:38:32,398
and Bodie have had some really nice

4183
02:38:30,299 --> 02:38:35,219
chats about those books so I think you

4184
02:38:32,398 --> 02:38:37,739
advise those if you like that

4185
02:38:35,219 --> 02:38:40,139
um Oliver Sacks the man who mistook his

4186
02:38:37,739 --> 02:38:42,478
wife for a heart and Awakenings are two

4187
02:38:40,139 --> 02:38:44,519
very interesting books if you like

4188
02:38:42,478 --> 02:38:45,959
um neurology and how things can go wrong

4189
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:48,300
I do have that one now I was trying to

4190
02:38:45,959 --> 02:38:52,500
remember what that was yeah yeah

4191
02:38:48,299 --> 02:38:54,719
um and then uh the extreme ownership and

4192
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:57,659
the dichotomy of leadership by Jocko

4193
02:38:54,719 --> 02:38:59,459
willing are both very good books if you

4194
02:38:57,659 --> 02:39:01,500
like that sort of accountability style

4195
02:38:59,459 --> 02:39:05,219
of things which I'm I'm pretty into

4196
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:07,379
myself yeah and then finally uh my two

4197
02:39:05,219 --> 02:39:09,299
final ones not gonna hurt me by David

4198
02:39:07,379 --> 02:39:11,519
Goggins is possibly my favorite book

4199
02:39:09,299 --> 02:39:12,478
ever so check that out but likewise if

4200
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:14,579
you want to learn a little bit about

4201
02:39:12,478 --> 02:39:16,679
Australian history I strongly recommend

4202
02:39:14,579 --> 02:39:19,920
you to check out a book called Dark emu

4203
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:21,780
by Brooke Bruce Pasco I I doubt anyone

4204
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:25,139
listening has heard of it it's a book

4205
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:26,819
that largely speaking when people came

4206
02:39:25,139 --> 02:39:28,978
and colonized Australia they very much

4207
02:39:26,818 --> 02:39:30,719
whitewashed the Aboriginal history and

4208
02:39:28,978 --> 02:39:33,420
said that they were very primitive

4209
02:39:30,719 --> 02:39:36,420
people and violent and blah blah blah

4210
02:39:33,420 --> 02:39:38,520
and this book really outlines how in

4211
02:39:36,420 --> 02:39:40,500
many aspects of their society they were

4212
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:42,479
far more advanced than us and so I'd

4213
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:44,700
highly recommend check out dark emu by

4214
02:39:42,478 --> 02:39:46,079
Bruce Pascoe it's amazing how that

4215
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:47,819
happened to the Native American culture

4216
02:39:46,079 --> 02:39:49,859
here over there just to any native

4217
02:39:47,818 --> 02:39:52,219
culture there were you know terrorized

4218
02:39:49,859 --> 02:39:55,079
by European

4219
02:39:52,219 --> 02:39:57,659
I generally think as far as humans go to

4220
02:39:55,079 --> 02:39:59,659
be fair uh any group that comes in

4221
02:39:57,659 --> 02:40:02,398
that's that's uh more technical

4222
02:39:59,659 --> 02:40:03,959
technologically advanced especially with

4223
02:40:02,398 --> 02:40:06,119
weapons

4224
02:40:03,959 --> 02:40:07,799
um that tends to be bad for the local

4225
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:10,200
population

4226
02:40:07,799 --> 02:40:11,879
um you know uh the uh the Mongols

4227
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:13,380
weren't European but you sure probably

4228
02:40:11,879 --> 02:40:14,938
didn't want them showing up to your city

4229
02:40:13,379 --> 02:40:17,279
you know

4230
02:40:14,939 --> 02:40:19,620
um and you know Europeans we get we get

4231
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:21,120
a we get a wrap because we colonized

4232
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:23,460
everywhere and it's a lot more recent

4233
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:25,260
and it's very well documented

4234
02:40:23,459 --> 02:40:28,438
um but it's certainly it's a human

4235
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:29,760
failing unfortunately where uh lots of

4236
02:40:28,439 --> 02:40:30,960
cultures I mean they used the first

4237
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:32,760
thing they used to do when they took

4238
02:40:30,959 --> 02:40:35,938
over a culture was burn the libraries

4239
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:38,040
and burn the knowledge you know um and

4240
02:40:35,939 --> 02:40:39,180
so you know there's uh there's aspects

4241
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:42,420
to that

4242
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:43,979
you know uh that uh that suck but it's

4243
02:40:42,420 --> 02:40:46,978
part of the human experience I think

4244
02:40:43,978 --> 02:40:46,978
recommendations

4245
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:51,780
I'm gonna throw out some book

4246
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:54,300
recommendations uh do it uh that some of

4247
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:55,079
the I'll start with some like some uh I

4248
02:40:54,299 --> 02:40:57,539
don't know necessarily they're not

4249
02:40:55,079 --> 02:41:00,180
weed-based necessarily but they they

4250
02:40:57,540 --> 02:41:03,200
they maybe inform your experience uh one

4251
02:41:00,180 --> 02:41:06,359
of them is called uh the NAT the the

4252
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:07,620
natural mind right and it's a book by

4253
02:41:06,359 --> 02:41:11,220
Andrew Weil

4254
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:13,920
and it's kind of a a study on why people

4255
02:41:11,219 --> 02:41:15,299
like to change their headspace why

4256
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:18,059
people like Altered States Of

4257
02:41:15,299 --> 02:41:19,559
Consciousness how normal it is for

4258
02:41:18,059 --> 02:41:21,420
people to want to alter their

4259
02:41:19,559 --> 02:41:24,359
Consciousness and how many different

4260
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:26,760
creative things come out of them putting

4261
02:41:24,359 --> 02:41:28,439
yourself in a different perspective

4262
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:29,939
um and I'll just I'll move on but one of

4263
02:41:28,439 --> 02:41:32,280
the coolest things he says usually the

4264
02:41:29,939 --> 02:41:34,020
first time that people get high is these

4265
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:36,180
like little kids spinning around in

4266
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:38,100
circles until they get so dizzy they

4267
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:41,100
can't stand up and they fall over

4268
02:41:38,100 --> 02:41:43,439
and that's usually the first change in

4269
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:45,420
Consciousness that people actually

4270
02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:47,100
experience and it's almost Universal

4271
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:48,960
right

4272
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:50,520
um so he got really famous for like

4273
02:41:48,959 --> 02:41:52,199
writing a bunch of self-help books and

4274
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:54,120
stuff like that but

4275
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:57,120
um that book came out in the 70s when he

4276
02:41:54,120 --> 02:41:59,399
was still a researcher uh you know and

4277
02:41:57,120 --> 02:42:02,399
and it's really interesting take on why

4278
02:41:59,398 --> 02:42:06,779
our mind likes having a change in

4279
02:42:02,398 --> 02:42:08,639
Consciousness right uh two would be uh

4280
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:10,319
another book by Andrew Weil called from

4281
02:42:08,639 --> 02:42:12,539
Chocolate to Morphine

4282
02:42:10,318 --> 02:42:15,420
and it is a book it's probably a little

4283
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:17,640
dated now but it is basically every drug

4284
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:20,100
that affects humans

4285
02:42:17,639 --> 02:42:21,840
um and the most up-to-date knowledge

4286
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:24,120
good and bad on what it does to you

4287
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:26,340
without all the governmental politics

4288
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:28,140
just like he's a you know Harvard

4289
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:30,239
trained physician so he just looked at

4290
02:42:28,139 --> 02:42:34,139
it like well what is the medical say

4291
02:42:30,239 --> 02:42:36,659
about caffeine or chocolate or heroin or

4292
02:42:34,139 --> 02:42:38,818
marijuana or you know whatever it might

4293
02:42:36,659 --> 02:42:40,559
be and so if people want to read about

4294
02:42:38,818 --> 02:42:42,180
what things do to you without a bunch of

4295
02:42:40,559 --> 02:42:43,199
[ __ ] like we were discussing with

4296
02:42:42,180 --> 02:42:44,639
weed

4297
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:46,920
um it's you know it's a little older now

4298
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:49,559
but it's probably a pretty good start

4299
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:50,818
uh getting on to the metaphysics side of

4300
02:42:49,559 --> 02:42:52,318
things like he was mentioning with ram

4301
02:42:50,818 --> 02:42:54,119
Das

4302
02:42:52,318 --> 02:42:56,279
um there's a book by the Dalai Lama that

4303
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:58,079
really affected me uh that I read when I

4304
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:59,640
was locked up which was the art of

4305
02:42:58,079 --> 02:43:01,620
happiness

4306
02:42:59,639 --> 02:43:02,760
and I don't think many people think

4307
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:04,140
about

4308
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:06,540
um happiness

4309
02:43:04,139 --> 02:43:08,699
and what happiness means in their own

4310
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:10,439
lives right and what feeling good means

4311
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:12,240
people chase all these things that their

4312
02:43:10,439 --> 02:43:14,100
parents want or their society wants or

4313
02:43:12,239 --> 02:43:16,139
what they think they want and they don't

4314
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:19,040
think about like what kind of life or

4315
02:43:16,139 --> 02:43:21,840
what kind of mental state leads to

4316
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:24,420
calmness and peace and happiness and

4317
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,920
enjoying life right and so since we all

4318
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:27,719
only know that we get this one shot

4319
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:29,239
maybe maybe not maybe not you know we

4320
02:43:27,719 --> 02:43:32,699
might as well enjoy it while we're here

4321
02:43:29,239 --> 02:43:34,859
uh and the mind is a funny thing

4322
02:43:32,700 --> 02:43:37,140
um so books that help you explore your

4323
02:43:34,859 --> 02:43:39,300
mind and explore why your mind does what

4324
02:43:37,139 --> 02:43:40,799
it does is pretty cool

4325
02:43:39,299 --> 02:43:42,539
you know

4326
02:43:40,799 --> 02:43:44,519
um and then you know speaking to the

4327
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:45,899
aboriginey side of things there's a book

4328
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:47,579
by Howard Zinn that's kind of

4329
02:43:45,898 --> 02:43:50,039
controversial it's called a people's

4330
02:43:47,579 --> 02:43:52,620
History of the United States

4331
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:54,420
um but it was basically written about

4332
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:56,760
all the people you know mostly we write

4333
02:43:54,420 --> 02:43:58,379
about like powerful white people that

4334
02:43:56,760 --> 02:44:00,659
had all these big effects on the world

4335
02:43:58,379 --> 02:44:02,398
and they sort of take it from like a

4336
02:44:00,659 --> 02:44:04,079
native's perspective or a woman's

4337
02:44:02,398 --> 02:44:05,579
perspective or a black person's

4338
02:44:04,079 --> 02:44:07,859
perspective or an immigrant's

4339
02:44:05,579 --> 02:44:09,239
perspective like what was America like

4340
02:44:07,859 --> 02:44:10,859
for them

4341
02:44:09,239 --> 02:44:12,898
right

4342
02:44:10,859 --> 02:44:14,818
um and so just you know any book that

4343
02:44:12,898 --> 02:44:16,920
that gets you out of your comfort zone a

4344
02:44:14,818 --> 02:44:19,079
little bit or teaches you something

4345
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:21,780
um about the world uh books are how we

4346
02:44:19,079 --> 02:44:23,340
pass knowledge down and so I'm a big fan

4347
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:24,960
so it's super cool that you brought up

4348
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:26,520

4349
02:44:24,959 --> 02:44:28,379

4357
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:43,020
pretty interesting book

there's uh there's there's a lot of

4359
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:47,399
knowledge out there and it's good so we

4360
02:44:45,239 --> 02:44:50,219
actually ran this thing about 50 minutes

4361
02:44:47,398 --> 02:44:52,379
longer than we almost ever do so for

4362
02:44:50,219 --> 02:44:54,539
that you are probably our longest chat

4363
02:44:52,379 --> 02:44:56,519

4364
02:44:54,540 --> 02:44:59,040

4369
02:45:05,818 --> 02:45:09,719
um yeah like I guess just off the top of

4370
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:11,460
my head I would say like you know shout

4371
02:45:09,719 --> 02:45:12,779
out to anyone who's ever been on the

4372
02:45:11,459 --> 02:45:15,000
show

4373
02:45:12,780 --> 02:45:18,239
um and you know everyone who's been on

4374
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,978
the show has helped uh steer me in some

4375
02:45:18,239 --> 02:45:22,799
form or another and I'm very grateful

4376
02:45:19,978 --> 02:45:24,420
for that hopefully whether the steering

4377
02:45:22,799 --> 02:45:26,879
was positive or negative I've hopefully

4378
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:29,818
come out a bit better the other side

4379
02:45:26,879 --> 02:45:31,739
um and a huge shout out to everyone in

4380
02:45:29,818 --> 02:45:34,019
the Australian scene who's trying hard

4381
02:45:31,739 --> 02:45:36,359
to help promote it I know that things

4382
02:45:34,020 --> 02:45:38,220
are still very fledgling and it's easy

4383
02:45:36,359 --> 02:45:40,380
to look at the states and to feel like

4384
02:45:38,219 --> 02:45:41,579
we're so far behind but I genuinely

4385
02:45:40,379 --> 02:45:43,318
believe there's a lot of people in

4386
02:45:41,579 --> 02:45:45,299
Australia who are both passionate and

4387
02:45:43,318 --> 02:45:46,799
are really putting their mind to it to

4388
02:45:45,299 --> 02:45:49,318
try to progress things along and that's

4389
02:45:46,799 --> 02:45:50,938
cool and furthermore

4390
02:45:49,318 --> 02:45:52,920
um you know like a shout out to all the

4391
02:45:50,939 --> 02:45:54,479
people who you know we stand on the

4392
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:57,478
shoulder of giants you know to any

4393
02:45:54,478 --> 02:45:59,340
anyone who's ever given me any work that

4394
02:45:57,478 --> 02:46:01,978
I've used for everyone who's just been a

4395
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:03,780
part of the scene before me I certainly

4396
02:46:01,978 --> 02:46:05,279
couldn't be here without all of the

4397
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:08,520
knowledge from those who have walked the

4398
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:11,520
path before us and so I try to always be

4399
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:14,100
very grateful for that and um my my

4400
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:15,720
final little thing would be um if you're

4401
02:46:14,100 --> 02:46:18,600

4402

happy to have you dude I mean our

4412
02:46:36,719 --> 02:46:40,019
audiences are are pretty similar I think

4413
02:46:38,579 --> 02:46:42,420
I think it's people that are seeking

4414
02:46:40,020 --> 02:46:43,859
like some kind of path to history and

4415
02:46:42,420 --> 02:46:45,000
cannabis so there's no reason that we

4416
02:46:43,859 --> 02:46:47,640
shouldn't be working together and I'm

4417
