for right I got one I got one to start

80
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:19,199
us off Matt um because I asked you the

81
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:24,199
same question a while ago uh Freeze

82
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,199
Blade wanted to know about the OG Bonnet

83
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,598
crosses oh gee but what about

84
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,158
him I think wanted to know what they

85
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,158
were and maybe what your general

86
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,120
feelings were about some of them okay

87
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,639
you know hey hold on you gave me the

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
king Louis one tell me about that one

89
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,479
okay so that was the the Lou cut that

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,319
resen had that he kept all those years

91
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,079
and uh I mean it's just like typical

92
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,560
what I would consider OG Kush Southern

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,200
California OG Kush as we knew it in

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,158
Southern California I think that Louis

95
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:57,199
is a good representation of that um I

96
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,039
think like the same cut got ped as sfv

97
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,518
as Larry as Tahoe as all kind kinds of

98
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,798
stuff you know what I mean like just

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,319
depending on where you were at but this

100
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,959
is the Louie cut and uh yeah I mean when

101
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:13,598
I grow it it's really it's more of the

102
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,040
Soapy less sweet piny um soapy piny

103
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:20,959
territory or or furniture

104
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:23,120
polish um yeah furniture polish piny

105
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,639
Pine was that one like super golf ball

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
structure or did it stack really well no

107
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,879
no it's super golf ball for me

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,879
especially that but I think I think it

109
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,279
can be grown in certain like tables and

110
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,240
environments where you can get it to

111
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,918
stack hard you know kind of

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,680
like yeah I think you can I just never

113
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:42,639
grew it that way I was always growing in

114
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,918
um cocoa pots drain to waste on the

115
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,038
floor as big as possible you know yeah

116
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,439
but um let's see God there was a master

117
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,399
list I had the other day I don't

118
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,360
remember who asked me all the OG Bonnet

119
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,239

120
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,720
I didn't keep and you just wouldn't stop

121
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,720
for like 20 minutes I was like you like

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,520
five of them so I'm gonna I'm gonna see

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,479
if I can name them all right so we have

124
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,439
the SF Bonnet we have the Louis Bonnet

125
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,639
we have the earlene Bonnet which is the

126
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,600
fake Irene Blue Bonnet um the fake Irene

127
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,079
came from Cecil some kind of Bubba OG

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,759
hybrid um what else do we have in there

129
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,079
the Kush the 92 OG which a lot of people

130
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,759
confused for the same cup but they're

131
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:26,359
totally different growing um we had

132
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:29,879
loopus headband we had motor breath we

133
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,720
had or motor breath 15 specifically um

134
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,199
there's some more in there isn't

135
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,199
there there's like 12 and I'm only up to

136
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,399
seven I don't remember Sol did you say

137
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,000
Sol assassin oh triangle oh yeah no

138
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,719
triangle Sol assassin and there's some

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,839
more there's a few more in there and I

140
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,000
just can't remember them all off the top

141
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:52,159
of my head but yeah the main reason I

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,240
did it was because I had what's that the

143
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,199
resin yeah was the Kush um the main

144
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,600
reason I did all those was because I it

145
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,240
was one of the first times I had had

146
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,160
that many OG Cuts oh and the pure kush

147
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,240
too to make to make a canyon pure kush

148
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,759
and if you count the Bubbas which is the

149
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,400
katsu Shaw's Bubba and the pre98 which

150
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,639
Shaws in the pre98 I'm pretty sure the

151
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,799
same exact cut um Denali said nice Tri

152
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,519
thousand I'll remember

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,439
this we should used the URL Hider I know

154
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,478
see I messed up I messed we almost got

155
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,439
him to come into chat sneak him in

156
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,120
without him

157
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,240
knowing um but yeah like uh the reason I

158
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,439
did was because I had all the cuts at

159
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,960
the same time and I wanted to see how

160
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,918
each bred to the bonnet especially

161
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,839
because I was learning how the Bonnet

162
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,038
bread at the time um the main

163
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,439
differences are going to be like the

164
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:41,240
lumus headband that does take a more big

165
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,598
Cola almost uh sour like structure um oh

166
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,079
there was the did I do that yeah I did

167
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,478
the 56 day headband that was in there

168
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,240
too which is another OG Kush um the

169
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:53,560
triangle jel glue Bonet was also in

170
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,240
there um yeah like it was just too much

171
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,680
I did I did too many but a lot of them

172
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,759
very similar you're going to run into

173
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,759
similar expressions from all of them um

174
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,319
but yeah some some ogs are just very

175
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,800
different like the lumus headband the

176
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,240
triangle um I can't stress this enough a

177
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,240
lot of people get here triangle and hear

178
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,360
that it's a mom of OG they'll grow the

179
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,680
cut and get a hold of the cut and

180
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,360
they'll be like damn this is not what I

181
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,639
was expecting for OG because it's like

182
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,160
[ __ ]

183
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:25,199
it's for its for its time it's kind of

184
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,879
midy uh earthy compared to like the the

185
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,639
very turpy Kush cut right so a lot of

186
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,479
people are expecting that turpy Pine all

187
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,000
stuff when they get triangle and it's

188
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:36,439
just not that so the Triangle stuff will

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,959
definitely take in a different direction

190
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:43,240
than the Soapy pinea stuff it's more

191
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:46,638
earthy cushy it's it's hard to explain

192
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,519
but yeah it's it's it's not what you

193
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,759
think but yeah I don't know should I

194
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:55,038
cover more of that or

195
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,400
less we have so many questions let's

196
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:01,478
Okay we take a break um I I'm trying to

197
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,918
okay here's here's a breeding one how do

198
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,439
you decide which female to reverse when

199
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,519
making feminized seeds with two

200
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,519
different

201
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,279
females I don't make seeds with two

202
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,478
different females I don't make femin

203
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,359
seeds with two different females at the

204
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:15,000
same

205
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,759
time um no he he means like if you want

206
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,120
to do like a headband to an OG and

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,759
they're both clone only how do you

208
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,079
decide which one you want to feminize

209
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,960
onto the other and my answer in short

210
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,959
would be you try and reverse both of

211
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,959
them which whatever's better and if you

212
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,878
can get seed off of doing both of them

213
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,519
and compare you know it's always more

214
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,800
data more it's a similar question to

215
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,440
people asking like what do males pass

216
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,000
versus females and there isn't really

217
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,039
like

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,958
yeah people when they when they ask

219
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:44,879
about reversals they they have this

220
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:47,119
thing in their head where they think um

221
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,759
one if you reverse it it's going to be

222
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,480
the dominant partner in the in the

223
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,399
hybrid they have all kinds of and

224
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,360
there's just no set answer to any of

225
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,799
that it always depends and and if people

226
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
are giving you set answers then they're

227
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,319
just bullshitting you but like let's say

228
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,000
um let's say uh I'm going to do a

229
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,480
reversal I'm going to pollinate Let's uh

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,278
let's just say blueberry random

231
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,959
blueberry and I have two

232
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:16,559
different Bubba Cuts let's say katsu

233
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:18,958
Bubba and the pre98 shaw Bubba right um

234
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:22,199
katsu's Bubba is a little bit different

235
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,639
um it grows more asymmetrical type Bud

236
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,360
structures um it's much more purple

237
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:31,360
passing and I get a lot more coffee

238
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,800
earthy from the katsu then I do the

239
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,399
typical Bubba which I can pull soapy all

240
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:39,919
kinds of stuff from it cushy soapy stuff

241
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,759
um the reason I would choose one over

242
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,319
the other is one possibly reverses well

243
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,639
and drops life pollen and we have more

244
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,800
experience with it or I want the traits

245
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:53,679
more from the katsu Bubba

246
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,240
versus the pre98 and that's just knowing

247
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,039
your clones don't reverse any clones

248
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,159
that you don't know essentially like if

249
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,439
you don't know about the Clone in the

250
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,600
first place it's not going to do any

251
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,279
good to reverse it and hit it to

252
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,360
something unless you're just playing

253
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,278
which is fine but you're not breeding

254
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,560
because you don't even know what you're

255
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,879
doing you don't know what traits are

256
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,958
going to pass there's no predictive

257
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:13,200
measures there's no anything but playing

258
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,599
yeah I've actually had the pleasure of

259
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,480
doing both sides of it where like um

260
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,399
trying to remember the specific

261
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,278
example um it had to be something with

262
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
Skittles you know where I like cross

263
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:25,919
Skittles to something and then cross

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,320
that to reverse the other parent onto

265
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,519
the Skittles you know yeah and um they

266
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,959
are very different you know Skittles is

267
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,320
probably not the best example on that

268
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,958
front but like um I've seen it to where

269
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,680
you get like they're usually in the same

270
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,518
ballpark but um you I've liked one

271
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,159
better than the other before you know

272
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,799
and like or like one will have a higher

273
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,919
prevalence of Herms something like that

274
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,199
you know yeah the Bubba examples I was

275
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,039
just laughing to myself because I'm like

276
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,800
well Bubba dumps if you just spit on it

277
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,958
and like call it a bad girl you know

278
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,679
just spit on a little

279
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,638
bit that plan I've never had any trouble

280
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,479
with but I didn't know the like

281
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,120
expressional differences I've never like

282
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,079
had mine have always just been Bubba

283
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,720
when I've had them and so I didn't know

284
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,679
the the coffee side of things was more

285
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,639
leaning to the katsu I need to I need to

286
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,319
get me a cut of that katsu now yeah I

287
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,600
don't even know if anybody kept it I

288
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,480
really don't um yeah man I haven't seen

289
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:25,240
it around I just got 98 back but it was

290
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,399
kind of kind of me I don't know if I

291
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,159
passed it to anyone if anybody so I

292
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:33,559
passed all our ogs to bitter

293
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,439
I think he got some Bubbas um by someone

294
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,719
else I gave him to but I don't think the

295
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
catsu made it out nobody really wanted

296
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,519
it

297
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:46,159
yeah mostly because dude's a [ __ ]

298
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,360
dippy dooo whose name's attached to it I

299
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,958
think that's one of those things like

300
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,480
you don't want to coign someone who kind

301
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,319
of sucks but it isir yeah those those

302
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,759
really rich coffee Expressions though

303
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,760
were like some of my favorite old school

304
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,319
yeah it's nice it I just love Bubba

305
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,559
period I like the high I like everything

306
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,120
yeah whenever I grow pre98 I kind of get

307
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,799
more of like a fruity soapy thing and so

308
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,600
and I don't really get much color and I

309
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,399
like the color on that more purple cut

310
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,519
that was the one that would they would

311
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,000
both float around in Arcada when I was

312
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,720
living up there but the the pre98 and

313
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,919
the green more green Expressions was

314
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,240
more common

315
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,319
yeah yeah one from

316
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,839
good you can finish your thought mat

317
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,920
it's a just Kat is probably a hybrid of

318
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,959
Bubba it just with what and I doubt

319
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,198
katsu has any clue or orgon kid maybe

320
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:37,559
White Rhino if you would ask orgon kid

321
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:39,519
would probably be his first bet um but

322
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,759
it's just one of those things where like

323
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,839
if I were choosing to breed with one bub

324
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,360
over the other I would take that in

325
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,839
consideration too knowing it's a hybrid

326
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,440
and get a breed that there is potential

327
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,639
to breed away from Bubba you know I

328
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,000
wonder if that's what's in that one

329
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,639
dude's uh coffee line with a K have you

330
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,159
seen that oh ka yeah uh ka's coffee I

331
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,480
can't remember I think it's like a star

332
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,838
fight or something I can't remember

333
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,839
yeah

334
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,320
yeah um we had a question for Farmer Dan

335
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,000
from Buckshot from a bit ago it says

336
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,199
what cut of strawberry banana do you

337
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,159
have um it's just the Crockett cut just

338
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:18,198
the I'm not sure if it was their

339
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,480
original selected clone but they

340
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:23,039
recently got it back in Clone form I saw

341
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,879
it on their IG and uh it's like the

342
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,319
spitting image of the exact clone that I

343
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,039
recently received and so that at least

344
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,199
gives me some tiar of like well I mean

345
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,799
like if it's something that they're

346
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:34,439
going to end up working with it probably

347
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,479
at least has those hash and rosin

348
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,720
qualities that that line is kind of

349
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,600
known for and so that's the reason I

350
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,000
took it in it was from a uh God I

351
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,839
actually don't know where that came from

352
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,198
I think one of the one of the people I

353
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:52,240
work with came back from an event with

354
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:55,039
it um one for and by the way you too you

355
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,720
see the our comments uh the chat thing

356
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,799
right you can actually favorite comments

357
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
so if you see questions that you like

358
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,319
there's a star in the top right you can

359
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,759
tell that doesn't that doesn't like tag

360
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,040
them it just shows it for us it's just

361
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,800
for us yeah I just pulled up a little

362
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:12,679
Tech St but

363
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:17,399
so real quick ka's coffee is the Alien

364
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:19,319
OG alien Kush so it's two swerve lines

365
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,320
cross to each other are those swerve I

366
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,759
thought those were those were

367
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,480
odds well just depend it's the alien

368
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:30,360
Kush F2 so that would be swerve and alen

369
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,879
OG is gonna be uh

370
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,800
I mean In fairness OB and uh the

371
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,720
original alien who is not the alien

372
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,639
selling seeds right now are two

373
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,120
different people like and OBS was

374
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,600
responsible for the alien Tech and

375
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,720
bringing that to the table he never

376
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,320
really passed it but there were people

377
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,360
popping up pretending they had the alien

378
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,759
Tech yeah it I would I I would probably

379
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,039
say OBS has more to do with alien Tech

380
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,480
and I would avoid any swerve anything

381
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,639
when it comes to but I'd avoid swerve at

382
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,920
all

383
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,919
costle oh bro I've found I've found his

384
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,799
stuff more than I care to admit in the

385
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,399
the work that people in my position for

386
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,120
the same company were before me I like

387
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,839
look through the documentation I'm like

388
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,000
oh that's that's a swerve line I'm like

389
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,440
oh that's another [ __ ] artist I'm

390
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,639
like oh yeah it's great the good thing

391
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,480
about him though is you know that he

392
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,198
probably bought those seeds in bulk from

393
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,680
a hopefully respectable person and just

394
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,519
relabeled them so hopefully it was still

395
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,879
good regardless you know I had a dude

396
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,240
who um uh [ __ ] where I think it was in

397
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,360
LA who told me that he used to work for

398
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,639
him as a packager and he's like if we

399
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,039
ran out of something and it was selling

400
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,519
hot he's like we'd throw anything in

401
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:45,599
those vs oh yeah yeah like oh yeah that

402
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,278

ones none of them are G to be cute what

475
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,678
did I grow outd door this year a lot of

476
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,839
the creamy punch and ABC stuff what did

477
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,480
you see in those creamy punch

478
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:10,480
man uh dude because I don't know

479
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,640
anything about that cream cut I'm not

480
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,599
well it's different than the cream cut

481
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,280
the cream line that we had was the

482
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:20,759
Silver it was silver Pearl Blue Bonnet

483
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:22,639
oh okay and that it's essentially like

484
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,200
silver Pearl looking plants with

485
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,080
blueberry mixed with silver Pearl turps

486
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,640
it's it's one of my favorite out of all

487
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:30,599
of them uh the creamy punch is that

488
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,200
cross

489
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:37,480
to um Punchy bler which is the banana

490
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,360
punch Blue Bonnet so I thought I would

491
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,679
be seeing a lot of graped Sweet Tarts a

492
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:44,279
lot of um maybe some Berry poking

493
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,280
through but because purple punch is so

494
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,918
dominant I wasn't sure and the silver

495
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,200
Pearl also dominates heavily so really

496
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,038
wasn't sure which way it was going to go

497
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,640
but they all seem to be some version of

498
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,000
the silver Pearl with very grap Smarties

499
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,360
like just down the middle and they all

500
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,038
tend to be very resonance like the

501
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,158
silver Pearl um they do tend to be leafy

502
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:04,279
outdoor but I just haven't grown enough

503
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,600
indoor to know so I don't know man I

504
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,319
suck at outdoor so it's kind of hard to

505
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,759
judge on outdoor yeah it was just

506
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,798
something to run think I think hi hippie

507
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,759
was trying to bait you into talking

508
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:16,599

514
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,600
in the ground uh pots little tiny ones

515
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,158
like a [ __ ] dummy yeah to go in the

516
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,879
ground you'll like it'll be night and

517
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,760
day bro especially with how hot it is

518
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,320
there yeah dude it was stupid I was

519
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,119
trying to do outdoor indoor or indoor

520
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,879
outdoor um feeding with bottles and

521
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,479
PS gallons dude if you're on the coast

522
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,760
and in that fog band or like just

523
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,519
outside it that [ __ ] is like in some

524
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:52,319
ways the way to go you know what I mean

525
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,720
especially if you're feno hunting you

526
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,519
know and um but it's just when it's hot

527
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,679
like even like where I'm at because I'm

528
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,639
just like North but kind of the same

529
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,320
like banned away from the coast like

530
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,440
it's just so hard to get away with

531
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,759
anything smaller than like a 35 to 50

532
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,640
gallon pot

533
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,759
yeah um mango puff from Gage worth

534
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,159
running [ __ ] no those guys are [ __ ]

535
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:17,919
trash all of them they're always going

536
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,200
to be trash um bring back the Froot

537
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,360
Loops it wasn't called Froot Loops it

538
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,200
was called tricks and uh it was kind of

539
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,359
weird when when I was given those seeds

540
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,319
originally by motor Rebel the um

541
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:31,639
Colombian gold is KMD cross to Columbia

542
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,519
Gold and when motor Rebel gave me those

543
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:38,159
it was like 09 I want to say and I

544
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:41,519
didn't know who made him they came from

545
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,200
Moda um I was running them they were

546
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,278
really nice they were obviously half

547
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,759
Colombian gold half KMD um it was a

548
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,079
worked Colombian line so I'm guessing

549
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,400
the farmers's choice Colombian because

550
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,439
I've grown those and it was very similar

551
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,559
in turbs and flowering time uh most of

552
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,440
them were around 11 to 14 weeks which

553
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,960
was short for a Colombian so again that

554
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,519
brought me to a worked line um Loompa

555
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,919
later took credit for it so I was just

556
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,918
kind of assumed it was his but I I just

557
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,679
never know with him um yeah I I don't

558
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,159
know if any of those seeds still pop

559
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,320
anymore I don't know who's running it I

560
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,278
think Denali ran it for a long time too

561
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:22,480
he might still have one I I genuinely

562
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:22,480
don't know but yeah who

563
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,599
knows what else we

564
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:35,360
got I've starred a few right cool

565
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,278
perfect that helps I think Indo wanted

566
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:41,719
to know about the ABC stuff of course

567
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:44,319
you do um I you know it's only in the F1

568
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,839
right now so with ABC or it's I'm

569
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,079
actually growing subterfuge I hate

570
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,678
giving that guy any credit um he's an

571
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,720
[ __ ] but it is what it is it's it's a

572
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,400
subterfuge and I was growing that I

573
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,519
pollinated it with creamy punch but in

574
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,640
the f1s you're not going to see any ABC

575
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:00,038
type traits so there's nothing going to

576
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,240
be done with this first round I was

577
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:02,599
going to pass him up some people if they

578
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,759
wanted to run him just to see what it

579
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,038
looks like but there's not going to be

580
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,919
any of the ABC trait it'll probably be

581
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:10,558
like

582
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,440
trinoline creepy punch um I'm just

583
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,038
interesting I'm interested to take my

584
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:19,320
own shot at breeding away from those

585
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:19,319
those obvious trinoline only TPS from

586
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,159
ABC see um what can you tell me about

587
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,960
Afghani cure would it be a good choice

588
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,000
to work some CBD into a line yes but

589
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,519
it's only again it's only F1 CBD is a

590
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,038
breeding trait so it need to be taken

591
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:37,720
further tested uh lock in the CBD trait

592
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,000
um take it to F4 that's how you lock in

593
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,400
CBD but yeah it's it's a great place to

594
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,079
start I mean it's going to be skunky CBD

595
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,640
hard to beat that you

596
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,240
know uh someone asked this and I think

597
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,840
I've asked you this before as well Matt

598
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,400
someone asked whether or not you've done

599
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:59,720
urle

600
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:02,519
Bonnet I guess you no no I did uh

601
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,640
um urle treay dog Bonnet so it was the

602
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,480
poodle nuts aka dog Walts from high and

603
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,480
Lon that was the closest I got I

604
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,960
think see

605
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,880
here is the Durban Poison cut all over

606
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:23,720
Colorado and C the Sandy Weinstein cut I

607
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,480
doubt it nobody can link anything back

608
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,558
to Weinstein nobody can link anything

609
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,038
back to Weinstein I don't know anything

610
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:32,960
about that I just got a my first urban

611
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:35,879
cut and it's not like anything

612
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,240
anyone has described it to me as and I'm

613
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,120

621
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,640
sounds like Urban oh really yeah okay

guy that uh that asked if S1 seeds are

631
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,278
better than f1s yes that's the one I was

632

like I can post it on the the water

637
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,319
cooler like the general chat on the

638
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,038
Discord where it's a S1 hybrid side by

639
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:43,000
side with one of my like male female uh

640
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:45,278
f1s and the Vigor is between like it's

641
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,720
like it goes down a step so it's like an

642
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:50,798
F1 hybrid you got this nice beautiful

643
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,200
vigorous seedling the um feminized

644
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,558
hybrid it's the same thing but like 3/4

645
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,440
size and then you see the S1 of like an

646
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,759
OG specifically and it is the the dwfi

647
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,919
little [ __ ] of all time growing so slow

648
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,759
and like even though they were fully

649
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:10,679
developed seeds like terrible germ rate

650
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:14,319
um you know like 50% and so um yeah no

651
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:17,798
f1s of regular male females are the way

652
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,200
to go I would agree I like s1's like

653
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:20,519
anything it's just different tools for

654
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,319
different purposes if you want something

655
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:26,158
to breed more direct and and narrow then

656
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,960
yeah an S1 selection would be cool but

657
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,840
um yeah I mean just they're two

658
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,200
different things completely

659
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,759
different yeah I believe uh on like one

660
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,720
of Caleb's interviews he was just like

661
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,038
S1

662
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,000
suck as far as like their growing

663
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,519
capability and I'm just like yeah yeah I

664
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,119
agree man like they're kind of a pain to

665
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,639
work with sometimes but like the things

666
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:49,839
you can find in them you can't find

667

for you real quick there was one I saw

686
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:36,480
like really early that I wrote on my my

687
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,919
notepad was uh have you worked any CBD

688
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,000
lines and uh I have had the pleasure of

689
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:45,919
working a ton of CBD lines I was uh

690
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,319
involved and people trying to make a ton

691
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,960
of money on hemp seed and all that in

692
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,720
the early days and so I collected I

693
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,880
still have just like multi- pound

694
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,519
baggies of so much hemp and CBD stuff

695
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,360
and um I did a ton of stuff with Ringo's

696
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,798
gift which was an awesome cut if you

697
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,278
ever have the chance to get hybrids of

698
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:08,119
that um they're they're really good I

699
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,919
would kind of I'm trying to think who

700
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,798
the better sources of that would be

701
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,919
nowadays um but um I got to work a bunch

702
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,519
of that Willie G's Lebanese stuff and a

703
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,559
bunch of hybrids of that um that that

704
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,880
wasn't consistently High CBD but there

705
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:26,000
were some really cool plants in there

706
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,120
they're on my my Ig Caleb wants to know

707
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,640
about that one I think

708
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,639
which one the uh the last one you

709
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,559
talking the Lebanese oh the Willie G

710
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,080
yeah oh dude I have so much I have like

711
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:39,839
the pure direct because I I I did some

712
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,720
work with those guys and so like I have

713
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,398
so much of that if he ever wants any

714
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,240
like absolute [ __ ] tons I think he

715
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:50,239
actually bought a bunch yeah yeah they

716
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,319
they would range from like three to 7%

717
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,798
CBD and then an equal amount of THC in a

718
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,960
lot of instances there's a lot of one

719
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:59,599
toone stuff in there which is in my

720
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,440
opinion like more useful than like pure

721
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:06,079
CBD stuff absolutely in a lot of

722
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:09,000
instances for the end consumer um but

723
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,558
um dead on

724
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,798
Skittles yeah yeah even even this top

725
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,519
Bud right here that's all where is it

726
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,599
that one it's all ugly yeah a while back

727
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:21,359
we had a we had a chat about like

728
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,599
different LEDs on the the general chat

729
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,319
on the Discord and um I was talking

730
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,119
about some lighting trials with these

731
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:28,480
gavita they're like I can't ever

732
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,798
remember remember what the model number

733
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,399
is but it's the ones that look like yeah

734
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,879
it's like the plasma style ones where it

735
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,119
looks like a gavita like a standard HPS

736
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,000
fixture kind of or like the profile of

737
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:42,079
it and they're way up high and it's just

738
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,599
this little like you know 18inch by 10

739
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:47,240
inch little fixture up top but I I

740
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:50,359
recently saw some Skittles in week eight

741
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,759
um like a day ago day and a half ago um

742
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:56,119
and the expression of it was I've never

743
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:58,960
seen it before it was dark purple like

744
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:01,119
thoroughly thoroughly dark purple and it

745
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,159
the nose wasn't really there either and

746
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:06,839
so I was like ohuh man this is [ __ ]

747
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,278
really weird man um but I liked it still

748
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,879
it was still good it was just different

749
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,558
I thought that was an interesting little

750
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,559
tidbit Ed

764
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,919
get I'm seeing some interesting

765
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,120
questions here finally coming in yeah I

766
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:00,600
can't star them so you guys have to all

767
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,599
right right out yeah I can do

768
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:08,839
it there's one um just recently one an

769
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,200
auction of Mr Nice for G13

770
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:13,319
IBL genetically stabilized but

771
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,120
essentially an S1 what are your thoughts

772
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:19,319
on its authenticity and general opinion

773
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:21,319
the only G13 s1s that I know of that

774
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,678
made it over there were the ones that I

775
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:28,359
sent Neville of um the Airborne G that I

776
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,679
had made the the s1's of the Airborne

777
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,558
G13 s1s and he used those in projects

778
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,919
now I don't know if he ever gave any of

779
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,960
those to

780
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:42,519
Shanti but there weren't so many seeds

781
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,960
that there's like packs to sell um G13

782
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,159
died a long time

783
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,278
ago so I'm not sure how that would work

784
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,799
I I have a lot of respect for Shanti a

785
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:56,000
lot and um a lot of people still do

786
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:58,278
there has been some interesting stuff on

787
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,880
Instagram lately that doesn't quite

788
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,359
correlate with what we know in history

789
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,919
or previous claims and I just don't know

790
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,278
if that's like just being tired after

791
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,360
all these years getting asked a million

792
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,919
questions and then eventually

793
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:10,479
something's going to um not correlate

794
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:12,759
but then there's things like showing a

795
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,720
picture of Hy that is obsoletes chosen

796
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,278
male of something completely different

797
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,839
you know like saying hey this is the Hy

798
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:18,960
maale it's like oh wait no we're

799
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,359
familiar with that picture that was OBS

800
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,720
Soul's maale um things like that that do

801
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:27,918
confuse so while qualifying it with that

802
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,159
like I've used a lot of

803
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:34,320
um Mr nce stuff I've enjoyed it I didn't

804
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:36,799
really love any of the Afghan based

805
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,200
stuff but with that said one of the main

806
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:43,119
things I chase is the Afghan which is

807
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,519
Dutch Afghani so um yeah it's it's a

808
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,678
hard it's a hard one to answer because I

809
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,638
I just don't think he's as consistent as

810
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,919
he used to be but I don't know if that

811
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:56,000
as far as with his answers um I just

812
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,000
don't know how that represents what he's

813
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,960
selling

814
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,879
that's the nicest way I can say

815
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,679
that and someone asked uh is it worth

816
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,919
trying AG Seed Co or Scott Blakey which

817
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:11,320
is Shany Baba Mr Nice to bring in older

818
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,880
lying to today's hybrids I would Dodge

819
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:16,720
AG Seed Co I would

820
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,080
rather I'm gonna get myself in trouble

821
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,319
um yeah that guy's a a turn and a half I

822
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,480
think that's pretty evident I don't even

823
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,519
have to comment on that that dude but Mr

824
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,159
Nice I mean like I know people popping

825
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,919
mango hat for Mr Nice you know last week

826
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,120
so um I'd say that's just as good a

827
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,120
place to start as

828
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,839
any I keep pairing there was at least

829
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,798
two different lines expressions of

830
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,599
Durban yes there's the Mel Frank uh

831
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:48,720
Durban which is supposed to be more

832
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:50,359
anosy like black licorice smelling um

833
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,880
that's a common trade at past and then

834
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:53,359
there's the Durban clone that circulates

835
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,039
California Colorado and all that it's

836
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:59,079
very trinoline the tpin wi the the

837
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:01,599
tendine one seems to be the one that has

838
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,879
like spun the world you know or spun

839
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,278
California and what most people are are

840
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,599
familiar with as far as um Durban right

841
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:11,679
now and which is not related to the F1

842
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,679
dur by any stretch the

843
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:18,159
imagination hey Matt we had one on like

844
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:20,239
your most uh humidity resistant Bonnet

845
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,480
crosses yeah that's bubbleberry for sure

846
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:27,638
I'd say yeah for sure um the bubble gum

847
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,358
breeds true for uh humidity

848
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,358
like humidity resistance mold resistance

849
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,519
all that stuff and it's proven itself

850
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,000
outdoor to be pretty

851
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,358
awesome related question M but not

852
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,960
exactly the same strains that would work

853
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:43,799
near the

854
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,320
equator so Tropics uh equatorial

855
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,800
strains like that's where like if I live

856
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,919
by the equator that's where I would be

857
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,800
like I would be shopping over at quick

858
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,480
seeds Kwik seeds.com like uh the real

859
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,960
Seed Co I'd be running equatorial

860
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,280
strains because you cannot run those

861
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,159
anywhere else to get get their real um

862
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,240
Expressions so I would be taking

863
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:05,118
advantage of that grow grow what works

864
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,479
best for your area not what's hype and

865
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,480
if if there's anything that we've tried

866
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,240
to push across these episodes that's one

867
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,280
of those things like a lot of people are

868
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,959
growing based on what they've been told

869
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,760
is dank and the lines that they've you

870
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,559
know that certain braiders like oh this

871
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,280
is the line man this is the Clone only

872
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:24,759
this is the Dank one but a lot of times

873
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,400
those lines suck in other environments

874
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,680
like I think cookies mainly popular

875
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,280
because it's [ __ ] easy to grow and

876
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:31,838
everybody looks like a PR growing

877
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,280
cookies because you can throw nitrogen

878
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,719
at it all through flour feed it like a

879
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,079
tomato and it looks fine it'll smoke

880
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,039
like [ __ ] but it looks fine enough and

881
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,359
that's how all this shit's sold so I

882
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,880
don't know um yeah so he probably

883
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,119
shouldn't try to grow like bubbas in the

884
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,640
by the equator no no I I had this

885
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,800
discussion with someone tonight that was

886
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:51,078
doing the um Black Friday sale thing and

887
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,079
they had picked up some of the freebies

888
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,440
of the blue resin Kush and after they

889
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,560
grabbed it right before they paid

890
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,679
they're like hey this is going to work

891
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,599
great outdoors in New York and I was

892
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:01,838
like no no no no no no don't be running

893
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,519
cush outdoor in New York when it's all

894
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:05,559
you know in the humid in Upstate New

895
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,119
York where it's all humid and foggy and

896
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:09,358
or whatever it is it's it's humid as

897
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,200
[ __ ] um so I ended up sending him the

898
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,440
bubbleberry direction because of that

899
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,679
just because it it doesn't make any

900
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,880
sense to grow something that is likely

901
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,879
going to mold or get

902
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,559
buritis yes uh here's a good one any

903
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,000
information on the F1 derb that CSI used

904
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,799
pictures where he got anything I grabbed

905
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,880
quite a few crosses so I I sourced the

906
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,480
F1 derb that was that was my sourcing um

907
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,039
I had had the cut originally and uh it

908
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,880
none of the crosses really sold of it so

909
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,519
we tossed it but over the years I I

910
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,920
wanted to do more than just one run with

911
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,079
it and make seeds I wanted to check out

912
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,720
more what it was

913
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,599
about

914
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:51,559
um Frost boss to Stony to me is how the

915
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,359
F1 derb um made its way back Frost boss

916
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,239
was a part of the original cookie crew

917
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,039
Stony no longer with us rest in peace

918
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:01,000
and then to me um or I'm sorry stoning

919
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,480
to CSI sourced by me I wasn't growing at

920
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,159
the time and I was moving so I had to go

921
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,000
straight over to CSI um I have pictures

922
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,199
of it we can't show pictures on here

923
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,880
because YouTube Just screws us anytime

924
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:16,799
we show pictures of weed because they

925
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,760
suck um but there are pictures in our

926
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,160
our codec that you can find to the F1

927
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,800
derb and there's an entry about it in

928
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,799
there more info about it so go to our

929
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,880
codex. theere codex. the Breeders

930
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,720
syndicate.com and type in F1 derb and

931
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,760
it'll pop up you see pictures and info I

932
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,039
think video too maybe not video pictures

933
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,200
the link is in the description Link's in

934
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,039
the

935
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:41,239
description I don't know why I repeated

936
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,239
that they can hear you just

937
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:48,480
fine which hp13 did you get sent um

938
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,318
let's see show oh that's how you do that

939
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,480
which HP 13 did you get he sent me the Z

940
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,480
hp13 oh you asked someone else not me

941
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,079
never

942
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,159
mind people um the the the most common

943
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,440
question we get about hp13 is if it's

944
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:04,719
related to G13 and it is not related to

945
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,200
G13 it's not the same as G13 hash plant

946
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,799
from an it's an old Hawaiian cut and

947
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,000
essentially The Story Goes it's just a

948
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,440
selection of hash plant number 13 the

949
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,838
13th selection of hash plant C seeds

950
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,000
hash plant which is hash plant Northern

951
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,318
Lights one that's supposed to be what it

952
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,960
is and and maybe it is I think so

953
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,079
probably I have no reason to doubt that

954
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,838
um but people see G13 HP and

955
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,519
automatically assume that's the same

956
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:30,679
thing and it is not the same thing not

957
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:33,559
even close so granted they both have

958
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,879
hash plan in them but G13 makes hp13

959
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,039
very

960
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,400
different yeah you'd be surprised how

961
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,239
much in like big companies documentation

962
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,880
and stuff how much the original names

963
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,318
like hp13 like and those like little

964
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,680
short acronyms like that still like

965
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:52,440
persist at our place we have tons of

966
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,279
them so [ __ ] many of them and they're

967
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,000
like the names the the real names of

968
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,319
what we call like a lot of like cuts

969
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,639
that people would

970
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:04,519
know yeah um hp13 to was one that I

971
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:06,358
hunted for years and years and years and

972
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,880
because at during the time I don't talk

973
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:10,519
about this a lot I I mean maybe I do

974
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,720
some when I was one of the few people in

975
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,759
the United States making fem seeds what

976
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,000
happened was a lot of other quote

977
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,720
unquote breeders and clone Traders

978
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,199
locked me out of cuts because they were

979
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:24,480
scared I would make s1s of every single

980
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,838
cut which I wasn't doing but they were

981
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,559
very scared of that and they didn't want

982
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,960
to leave that potential there so hp13

983
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,599
was one of those cuts that I was locked

984
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,679
out of because they didn't want hp13 s1s

985
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:36,960
at the time going around so I tried for

986
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,440
years to get that cut and then

987
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,559
eventually we sourced it all that but it

988
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,119
was very hyped and it was one of those

989
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,759
cuts that once I got it I was like oh

990
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,760
this is what I was hunting that's weird

991
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,680
because I probably wouldn't have hunted

992
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,000
that you know I don't really like hatch

993
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:55,919
plant myself some

994
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,719
people someone said man is Willie Nelson

995
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,000
what

996
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:01,439
someone said reeferman is Willie Nelson

997
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,719
oh no he had a he had a string called

998
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,400
Willie Nelson um oh and it wasn't it

999
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,159
wasn't made by him it was made by C or

1000
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,000
scabby from White Buffalo seeds they're

1001
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,318
the ones who actually made it and and

1002
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,318
they were working for reeferman and sold

1003
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,199
it through him was a Vietnamese black

1004
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,000
something can't remember the other half

1005
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:20,279
but it was dank man um and most of the

1006
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,960
good stuff that came from reeferman was

1007
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,519
made by other people so that's just how

1008
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,760
it goes that's what I got in the um when

1009
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:31,400
you sent out old seeds with the ga3 yeah

1010
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,240
you sent me Willie Nelson f2s oh you're

1011
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,559
the one who got those that's pretty cool

1012
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:40,078
yeah I need to do that whole experiment

1013
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:44,078
I've just been busy as you guys know how

1014
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,079
dare you how dare you the

1015
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:48,358
weed send so many seeds out that he

1016
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,280
doesn't he doesn't remember who's landed

1017
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:52,598
with

1018
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,640
who I don't [ __ ]

1019
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,200
know I don't know if any cuts are

1020
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,440
circulate I haven't seen willly 13 Cuts

1021
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,439
but like or Willie uh Nelson but that's

1022
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,838
like a Canadian thing I'm sure if there

1023
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,079
are there's Cuts up there check Montreal

1024
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:11,239
and all those

1025
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:11,240
dudes what else did I have starred

1026
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,119
here describe the HP 13 I'm assuming

1027
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,039
they mean growth characteris and tur

1028
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,800
profile last time I saw it it was Apples

1029
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,318
and feet growth it grows like a short

1030
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,400
squat

1031
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:30,358
little cash plant I mean it's not

1032
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,680
I would I would ask CI better because

1033
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:34,480
the grow I smoked of it was not very

1034
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,039
good at all and I just smelled apples

1035
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,480
and feet and I was

1036
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:40,519
like I'm not a big fan of those apple

1037
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,199
Aromas

1038
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,960
honestly yeah I'm not I'm not into it it

1039
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,279
smelled like apples and feet I I just

1040
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,079
didn't like it and it so even the sweet

1041
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,280
ones like that come out of like the

1042
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,480
apples and bananas type [ __ ] like I'm

1043
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,280
just an Apple Fritter like all those

1044
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,039
I've grown once and I've just been like

1045
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,800
GH

1046
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,159
yeah I can see that what else we

1047
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,560
got oh there was this one that I put up

1048
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:04,920
uh running pberry and found a killer

1049
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,960
smelling male blueberry muffins can you

1050
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,318
talk about your work with blue bonnet

1051
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,800
male selection you used I've gone over

1052
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,599
it a lot I don't know do people want to

1053
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,800
hear that again did I go over that again

1054
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:21,800
do it all right so the blue bonnet mail

1055
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:23,519
was is basically a four your project I

1056
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,240
mean it's still kind of going so it's

1057
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,880
not even over but to get to the point

1058
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,959
point of where I was actually selling

1059
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,960
seeds it had been three years and I went

1060
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,318
through the process of running every

1061
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,159
single blue line I could get my hands on

1062
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,960
I wanted to see every expression of blue

1063
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:41,318
learn everything about it I could and

1064
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,880
also with the idea of finding a breeding

1065
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:46,599
male and female um to select with and

1066
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,720
that's why it was just that the blue

1067
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,240
bonnet like it already had a renowned

1068
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,679
reputation um of being an amazing Blue

1069
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:55,039
Line like when I released my original

1070
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,639
riberry stuff it was the line that was

1071
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,279
competing with mine and everybody would

1072
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,838
say oh you got blueberry I know lone

1073
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,079
star's got a good blueberry too and I'd

1074
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,239
like [ __ ] him my blueberry is better

1075
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,400
well eventually I ran out all that stock

1076
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,719
sold all that stock stopped working with

1077
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,800
blueberry and then wanted to work with

1078
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,358
it again and that's when I was able to

1079
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,760
Source all blue bonnet stock from bod he

1080
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:17,799
had some in his collection and sent it

1081
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,040
to me and the male the most specific

1082
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,880
thing I remember when going through all

1083
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,440
this stuff the male had the traits in

1084
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,119
blueberry that I look for when I want to

1085
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,599
look for a blue breeding mail um which I

1086
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,519
don't really care to share because it'll

1087
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:32,079
give JD and all those idiots a major leg

1088
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,159
up and they should already know um but

1089
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,039
the one trait that did stand out to me

1090
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,960
was that the it was praying Non-Stop and

1091
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,920
it's not just praying out of Health

1092
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,358
every single leaf I mean this is like a

1093
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,119
six foot male from the top to bottom fan

1094
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,358
Leaf was like at this this angle all of

1095
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,640
them from top to bottom so it almost

1096
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,318
looked like he was waving like raising

1097
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,199
his hands and [ __ ] and um I really

1098
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:54,639
wasn't sure even when I used him up

1099
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,679
until when he blew pollen that he was

1100
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:58,279
going to be who I wanted I was very

1101
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:00,358
very convinced I was going to have to do

1102
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,400
this round run through that it might not

1103
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:05,400
be it go back select another male do

1104
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,800
another round and I was happy to do that

1105
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,358
but the first instance right I felt like

1106
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I had gone the right direction was when

1107
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:13,558
the male was blowing his pollen

1108
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,280
everywhere when I finally went in shook

1109
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,000
him hit the fan and I had on a big like

1110
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,640
one of those uh gas masks where it

1111
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,079
covers your whole face in a shield it's

1112
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:23,118
got the big cans like one of those

1113
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:24,720
expensive ones I was wearing that CU I'm

1114
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,800
super allergic to pollen and this was

1115
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,558
all indoor and and through that mask and

1116
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,039
this mask like you're you can wear it

1117
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:34,280
like cleaning up feces and [ __ ] it's not

1118
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:36,800
the smell doesn't penetrate too much but

1119
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,119
I could smell heavy blueberry blueberry

1120
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,920
jam type smells just by smacking the Mel

1121
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,039
around and that's when I was like got

1122
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,240
this [ __ ] that's the one I knew

1123
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,960
it but even then you don't really know

1124
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:48,799
no because just because it expresses

1125
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,440
blue and Berry doesn't mean it's going

1126
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,839
to breed true for that trait right like

1127
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,079
it could just show up sometimes it could

1128
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:57,159
be the one in a thousand that showed

1129
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,200
this trait and when you read with it

1130
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:02,719
it's only going to show at 1500 you know

1131
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:04,519
um I got very lucky and that's that's

1132
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,118
pretty much the story of it I mean it's

1133
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:08,358
just the best blueberry breeder I've

1134
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:12,519
ever seen and I didn't have anything to

1135
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:14,119
do with creating it or making it or no I

1136
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:15,719
don't have any responsibility for why it

1137
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,119
was such a good line but it ended up

1138
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:20,078
being a great

1139
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,358
line Matt um I'm glad you told the story

1140
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,440
again because I was just thinking about

1141
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:26,799
you know if I run some of you a

1142
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,800
blueberry and cross and kind of have to

1143
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,800
like blind sort of blind select a male

1144
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,599
you know this this story kind of reminds

1145
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,599
me about like what I should be looking

1146
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,280
out for or thinking about it anyway well

1147
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,200
like if you're selecting towards

1148
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,319
blueberry the first trait that I look

1149
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,480
for I don't even mind because I mean

1150
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,279
it's just it is one of those things it's

1151
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,920
it's purple stripes stocks you don't

1152
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,960
want a full purple stock you want to see

1153
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,400
stripes in the stock and it not be and

1154
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,000
and you have to know how to feed because

1155
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,838
you can you can get this from all kinds

1156
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,318
of deficiencies you know it has to be

1157
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:01,838
genetic and it has to look a certain way

1158
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:03,838
and the purple stripe stocks they've

1159
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,599
just always been that Telltale for me to

1160
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,920
when I know okay that's a berry line

1161
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,920
that's a berry line and I also learned

1162
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,079
that going towards the more narrow Leaf

1163
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,200
Berry expressions like the the oldtime

1164
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:21,400
Moonshine the blue moonshine the

1165
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:24,358
baluna um blue satellite to a degree

1166
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,000
um uh rocket moonshine Rocket Fuel

1167
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:28,799
things like that more narrow Leaf the

1168
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,920
blueberry is in there but it's more

1169
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,400
recessive in there it's harder to get to

1170
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:39,079
and harder to breed true The Afghani in

1171
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:41,559
blueberry is what threw the blueberry

1172
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:44,079
originally I had been chasing blueberry

1173
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:45,800
sativa stuff to find the blueberry I

1174
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,519
noticed when I popped the blue bonnet it

1175
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,800
was all Afghani looking and I was really

1176
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,559
really thinking oh no I'm not going to

1177
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,240
find it in here except that I just went

1178
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,839
with my gut and realized oh my God I

1179
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,078
should have been chasing Afghani all

1180
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,440
long just I like I like uh more narrow

1181
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,359
leaf type Highs but in the end it had

1182
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,440
the high that I wanted regardless of the

1183
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:07,279
um taxonomy to

1184
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,280
leaves hopefully that helps

1185
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,079
some no I mean it it this whole little

1186
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,599
tangent has kind of reminded me of when

1187
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,680
I was looking through um like some of my

1188
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,519
private gelato work that I did a few

1189
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:23,199
years ago yeah and um like I think I've

1190
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,800
told you about it I did like an ICC Mac

1191
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:27,279
wedding cake and my idea was to call it

1192
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,160
endgame because I was never going to

1193
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,200
breed with this [ __ ] again and then I

1194
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:34,039
got the job that I currently

1195
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,318
have you know you know what I mean but

1196
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:37,639
what's funny is I actually recently

1197
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:40,519
popped those at work too and so because

1198
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:43,159
it's like it's a really nice um like

1199
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:45,480
gelato cookie base lines like that and

1200
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:47,558
uh anyway the the whole thing just

1201
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,480
reminded me of how I found that mail and

1202
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:52,599
so like a buddy had given me two packs

1203
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,559
it was like him and another dude uh that

1204
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:58,640
we were friends with up in the Triangle

1205
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:02,119
uh made the the Mac wedding cake and

1206
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:04,199
then um they my buddy crossed it to the

1207
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:06,039
ICC cut that I gave him and then he gave

1208
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:08,439
me two packs of that right and so I'm

1209
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:10,039
going through it and I find this most of

1210
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,800
the males just look like normal weed

1211
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:14,239
plants but I find this one thing that's

1212
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,359
just like this cousin it you know what I

1213
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,439
mean like super Noy just like the

1214
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:21,558
shortest inter node I've ever seen on

1215
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,679
like any male plant ever you know what I

1216
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,200
mean like on average less than one inch

1217
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,960
you know and it was just like

1218
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:29,519
draped with leaves and so we called it

1219
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,199
cousin it you know like from The Adams

1220
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:32,800
Family it's just like covered and it

1221
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,439
would droop all the time because it was

1222
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,160
in like a 10 gallon pot and I had to

1223
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,159
water it like three times a

1224
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:41,239
day yeah I bet it was just beastly you

1225
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:42,838
know what I mean and like I knew it's

1226
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:45,000
just one of those things you know is

1227
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:46,838
just like that's what I want you know

1228
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,480
what I mean and so far everything I've

1229
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:50,239
crossed it with has been like pretty

1230
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,358
[ __ ] amazing and I've been getting a

1231
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,000
lot of feedback from uh I got especially

1232
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:56,798
one the one that I crossed into my key

1233
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,199
lime work

1234
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:01,599
was just like this killer super stacked

1235
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:03,199
version of Key Lime you know and this

1236
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,519
dude down in Houston found it and I was

1237
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:08,519
just like holy [ __ ] that's amazing you

1238
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,519
know what I mean and uh and so like

1239
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,559
sometimes with males you just know and

1240
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:14,318
then other times you have to like like I

1241
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,040
wasn't very intimate with that line but

1242
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,679
just like it's that gut instinct of the

1243
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,239
breeder sometimes you got to roll with

1244
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,639
it you know and then other times you

1245
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:23,519
know you're line super super well and

1246
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:25,318
you're just like I know this exact trait

1247
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,039
to look for and there's like two sides

1248
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:30,440
of coin you

1249
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,920
know absolutely that's that's that's a

1250
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,838
part of like what we talk about just

1251
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,200
learning your your clones you know um

1252
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,719
you run them enough you'll get to see

1253
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:39,078
them Express differently in the same

1254
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:41,399
room you know if you run them with

1255
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:42,960
different mediums different nutrients

1256
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,880
feed it a little different and being

1257
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,440
able to see all those different

1258
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:49,119
Expressions giv you ideas for how it's

1259
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:52,318
going to breed later on yeah for

1260
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,119
sure just as a little admin note uh I'll

1261
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,838
just mentioned that Local's having some

1262
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,240
technical issues with with his

1263
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,199
microphone hopefully will be on with us

1264
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,078
soon he has Tes difficulties everywhere

1265
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:03,879
he

1266
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:06,798
goes does zobo hit way too hard tonight

1267
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,798
he can't figure out his

1268
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,159
headset is he trying to talk again he's

1269
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,440
like I can't even talk to back he is

1270
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,679
yeah we can't hear

1271
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,960
you um I do have one note for for

1272
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:20,919
everyone um so a lot of you know like I

1273
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,039
I have a buddy named Matt Elite used to

1274
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,760
own Elite cannabis with uh some of his

1275
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,880
other friends and he did some of the

1276
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,359
best kemri I've ever seen like as far as

1277
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,798
regular seed breeding I don't know that

1278
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:37,798
anybody's done better chem 91 chem dog

1279
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:40,159
breeding than him and uh I've it's taken

1280
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:41,719
me years to convince him but he's going

1281
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:45,358
to send in some seeds finally for the

1282
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:48,118
site um for the store so keep your eyes

1283
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,318
peeled I'm I don't heavily vouch for a

1284
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:54,200
lot of other people's stuff very often

1285
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:55,880
anymore um main reason Matt doesn't sell

1286
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:57,759
seeds because he hates seed drop and he

1287
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,160
would much rather not deal with it so I

1288
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,839
had to beg him to do it but yeah I'm

1289
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,920
pretty stoked on it I'm very stoked on

1290
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,519
it I've I've run a lot of the D5 work

1291
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,200
from other people and I just he knew the

1292
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:11,559
chem so well like I sourced a lot of my

1293
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,000
best cuts for that like um after after

1294
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,400
Mooney killed my whole collection Matt

1295
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,760
was one of the first people to lineup

1296
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,119
and be like hey dude what do you need

1302
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:30,078
Matt a huge dead of gratitude his

1303
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:31,838
sourcing of cuts has always been

1304
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,599
phenomenal I've never had anything be

1305
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:36,199
like I don't know if that's a right cut

1306
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,240
bro like he's always had it dead on so

1307
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:42,199
I'm stoked for it can you guys Hear Me

1308
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:45,519
Now by the way yes hey there you are

1309
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:48,480
hey welcome yeah I just had to take my

1310
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,719
headset off I think that's what it was

1311
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,199
you're not getting any background you're

1312
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:54,919
good word okay that's what I was worried

1313
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:56,598
about mainly dude Discord does it to me

1314
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,720
constantly when I'm trying to game with

1315
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:00,559
people and I just have to like reset

1316
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,000
everything and I'm just like this is so

1317
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,680
[ __ ] dumb like there's nothing to fix

1318
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,039
it's just like literally like taking it

1319
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:07,719
off the setting it was on and then

1320
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,119
putting it back onto the same exact

1321
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:09,919
setting and it's like oh it [ __ ]

1322
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,318
works

1323
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,039
now um someone said Money Mike for the

1324
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:18,920
win I shout out Money Mike for the the

1325
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:21,920
camd or the I95 work um I saw Money Mike

1326
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,559
the other day on um in a private Forum

1327
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,400
so it was good to see him back too and

1328
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:26,640
that he's back [ __ ] hanging out

1329
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,039

1330
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,960
I've met him in person too super kind

1331
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,880
super super generous so yeah not a bad

1332
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:37,440
word at all to say about him I95 is some

1333
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,480
fire it's fire it's straight fire I

1334
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,280
thought it was just going to be a poly

1335
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,798
hybrid mess but it wasn't it's it's

1336
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:46,160
legit it's very legit yeah I'm pretty

1337
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:50,559
excited to see that 56 stay hybrid with

1338
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:53,199
that di 95 it's looking really nice now

1339
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,880
squatter OG hell yeah yeah totally it

1340
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,279
Stacks really nice too from what it's

1341
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,119
seeming

1342
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,160
the nodes aren't too space apart like

1343
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:03,920
you'd expect OG to be so that's pretty

1344
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:06,920
exciting I guess you know my

1345
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:10,599
he hey loog we had a we had a specific

1346
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,159
question for you from javs earlier uh

1347
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:14,280
wanted to know about your experience

1348
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,838
with weird variegation that shows up in

1349
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,519
Super Skunk lines and how he thinks it's

1350
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:22,679
related to feeding Matt you probably

1351
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:25,719
weigh in as well go ahead um I don't

1352
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:27,639
know I've seen a few things get rid of

1353
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:31,118
it

1354
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:33,318
um I don't believe in calmag but I find

1355
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,358
that bumping your calcium levels a

1356
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:38,239
little bit up and your magnesium up as

1357
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:41,279
well uh tend to get rid of that but I've

1358
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:45,118
also started looking at it in the way of

1359
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,760
uh What ions are responsible for like

1360
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,920
chlorophyll

1361
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:53,119
production and so like that's things

1362
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:56,119
like calcium I think magnesium iron some

1363
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,280
other micros so

1364
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:01,318
they kind of seem to like those things a

1365
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:04,160
little more um but I mean it doesn't get

1366
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:08,440
rid of it permanently

1367
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:10,000
um LEDs have made it worse in my opinion

1368
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,720
um but that's really kind of the only

1369
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,960
thing is just kind of bump up those

1370
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,399
secondaries and micros

1371
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,639
really yeah i' I've noticed the same

1372
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,960
exact thing and that the all those kind

1373
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:24,759
of Super Skunk type lines like sour

1374
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,639
hybrids and stuff like that um they all

1375
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,240
are just like pretty naturally heavy

1376
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,719
feeders too so if you're a low and slow

1377
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:33,358
guy it might be time to bump it up I'm

1378
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,919
dealing with it right now I have some uh

1379
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:38,039
Blue Dream Work and some Sour Gorilla

1380
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,280
Glue in the same tent and they want

1381
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,679
absolutely different things and so I

1382
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,400
have to mix up two different [ __ ]

1383
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:46,798
buckets every single time because the

1384
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,559
the blueberry stuff doesn't want and the

1385
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,519
blue dream stuff it's it's not like a

1386
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,519
super high Nitro

1387
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:56,079
feeder yeah definitely blueberry hates

1388
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,599
nitrogen

1389
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,160
yeah someone asked about hold on let's

1390
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,359
cover let me let me cover this real

1391
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:03,679
quick because this is something I feel

1392
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:07,000
like in the

1393
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:09,598
past 10 or nine Seasons that hasn't been

1394
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,239
covered accurately and I'll fix that

1395
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,680
right now let's talk headband let's talk

1396
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:18,279
headband because every time I talked

1397
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:22,519
about it I got shut up

1398
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:25,400
um headband uh as it started as best we

1399
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:28,440
understand was diesel 2 in New York uh

1400
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,318
that's from the sour crew the our chem

1401
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,838
bag

1402
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:35,358
seeds as it was originally labeled you

1403
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:37,000
know became labeled added an S sour chem

1404
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:40,920
because they didn't have the term diesel

1405
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,079
applied to chem yet that came later um

1406
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:47,039
as the cut made its way to California as

1407
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,318
best I understand or the OG cut made it

1408
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:51,039
to New York can't remember which way it

1409
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:52,920
went I think OG went to New York and

1410
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,640
they and the person that brought it out

1411
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,119
there gave the stipulation you cannot

1412
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,798
call this OG so they renamed it headband

1413
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,119
that's why there's more than one

1414
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:04,480
headband but it only got more

1415
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,720
complicated after that um there's been

1416
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,480
so many seed lines called headband there

1417
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,118
are so many posers right now that have

1418
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,838
only been growing less than five years

1419
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,400
with headband and their name stuck to it

1420
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:18,199
it is stupid it is stupid there's two

1421
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,400
types of headbands there's the chemy

1422
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:23,239
diesel headband and then there's the OG

1423
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,559
Kush Headband if it's a Sour OG it's not

1424
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:27,759
headband that's a later headband that's

1425
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:31,039
not a good definition for headband uh a

1426
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,839
Sour OG hybrid um I don't know how to

1427
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:36,720
say it any clearer like the people

1428
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:40,000
stacking their names with headband are

1429
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:42,558
all idiots stop following that [ __ ] none

1430
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,559
of those are headband stop it stop

1431
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:48,039
asking questions about it um if it's not

1432
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:50,798
a pure OG cut it's not the headband

1433
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:53,079
which I the 56 day headband is a pure OG

1434
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:55,639
cut makes sense that story stayed with

1435
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:58,039
it um the diesel number two I don't know

1436
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:00,920
that anybody has that alive

1437
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:01,799
so I would say that the OG the 56 day

1438
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,318
headband is probably the best

1439
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:07,798
representation of that and that anything

1440
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,920
that is otherwise doesn't have great

1441
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:12,119
stories or provenance leading back to it

1442
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,680
and that's where I'll leave it it's just

1443
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:18,880
I feel like our show helped push a

1444
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:22,598
narrative for a while that there was one

1445
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:25,480
legit sour one legit headband cut and I

1446
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:27,798
didn't agree

1447
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,039
um but I don't like to undermine people

1448
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:32,559
at the same time but I and I don't think

1449
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:34,039
that that story was necessarily pushed

1450
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,559
with that intention but over time it

1451
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:38,440
just seemed to develop so I just

1452
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:40,720
whatever um the LA Kush Headband came

1453
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,440
from mandal BR it should never been

1454
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,838
called La Kush it's not a Kush it wasn't

1455
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,679
from La should never been called

1456
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:49,119
headband um but that's what mandal

1457
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:50,558
crotch called it because that's who he

1458
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:55,160
is and he's no longer with us so we

1459
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:56,519
can't ask him why he renamed it um it's

1460
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:58,798
an excellent

1461
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:01,798
diesel

1462
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:04,639
type with that said there's no

1463
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:07,480
provenance to it being headband you know

1464
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:09,920
Reser a pvat headband again much later

1465
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,880
that was a later seedline no purpose in

1466
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,639
even discussing it same with C

1467
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,559
connections headband that's all saour

1468
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:18,879
ogi types or whatever he was selling as

1469
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:21,400

1470
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,079

1471
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,400
that's one of my boys but yeah his

1472
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:26,519
headband is not going to be the original

1473
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,960
headband and he came in way late to the

1474
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:32,280
game to know what's what there I love

1475
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,358
that dude and um yeah you know it just

1476
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,760
it's just kind of one of those things

1477
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,759
people stick people's names next to

1478
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,720
stuff and it's like oh you know like

1479
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,119
that's the one and then people start

1480
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,279
hyping oh do you hear that's the one

1481
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:43,960
that's the one it's like dude we know

1482
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,480
what the ones are and what they aren't

1483
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,318
it's been all like people are still

1484
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,639
asking like Savage headband Apothecary

1485
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:53,279
I've already said it no none of that

1486
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:57,838
shit's headband stop the answer is no

1487
00:58:53,280 --> 00:59:00,440
bro you know [ __ ] dying here muted I

1488
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:04,000
know really you're going to keep asking

1489
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,159
Jesus Christ that was the

1490
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,798
answer mandle brought also kind of a

1491
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:13,118
junky Vibe yes that's why the cops went

1492
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:17,880
his house and you know kid H yeah I uh

1493
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:20,559
um I uh um I have pretty decent access

1494
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,519
to a lot of cuts through through my job

1495
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,680
and there are no decent or there's

1496
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,358
actually just no any headband Cuts

1497
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:30,440
floating around the larger scene and the

1498
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:32,598
commercial scene at all and like people

1499
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,639
want them and they're just not there

1500
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:36,880
like there's AJ sour and that's as close

1501
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:41,199
as you can get to any of that stuff and

1502
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:43,798
it's not that close um so you know I

1503
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:45,679
think they're just being privately held

1504
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:47,519
it's just it's confusing because the

1505
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,879
same group that named it headband also

1506
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:52,038
got a OG cut and then name that headband

1507
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,480
too and it was distributed more than the

1508
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:55,839
original headband was and because it

1509
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,280
came came from that crew Everybody

1510
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,759
assumed that that must be the cam

1511
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,519
headband whereas it's just not the case

1512
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:07,119
I think legitimately if the diesel never

1513
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:08,400
two left that crew um or you know what I

1514
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,280
mean like that that selection that was

1515
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,358
called headband if it really didn't last

1516
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:16,119
the test of time then legitimately the

1517
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:19,598
56 days probably it one of those dudes

1518
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:22,760
pop seeds once he came out to Cal to La

1519
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,640
too uh I don't know who was out in La I

1520
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,200
think it was I I can't remember what I'm

1521
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,159
thinking of but it was a story I've

1522
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:29,919
heard from you on the show but I was

1523
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:33,199
like that one of those dudes that was

1524
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,880
originally in there um uh moved out to

1525
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:37,439
LA after all that and then popped seeds

1526
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,920
but that kind of is where like the story

1527
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,920
just like capped and ended that's I

1528
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:45,119
think that's where it fell down because

1529
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,000
um the cut came from LA to New York and

1530
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,760
I think this is one of the ones that

1531
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,159
NATO would repeat a lot um yeah came

1532
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,799
from LA to New York and it was it was

1533
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:56,000
Mojave that sent the cut out there or

1534
01:00:53,798 --> 01:00:58,079
brought it out there and he was in LA

1535
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,920
and somehow the story got confabulated

1536
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,519
to where OG there was people murdered

1537
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,880
all kinds of dumbass [ __ ] so yeah it was

1538
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:07,838
it was very confabulated but lately um

1539
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,760
within the past month we've had all of

1540
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:12,119
them come out on my profile during a

1541
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,400
discussion of headband to lay it out um

1542
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:18,200
granted it's not easy to pick apart in

1543
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,200
some ways but we we got it picked

1544
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:23,838
apart that pre 61 cut

1545
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:27,480
pack there is the Denali headband that

1546
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:27,480
is the only glitch one last I

1547
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:34,319
check so is hsc's headband of f Jesus

1548
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,880
Christ who the [ __ ] is HSC humble seeo

1549
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:40,880
like it doesn't matter how many times I

1550
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,880
say like bro

1551
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,480
stop I can't I can't did I say that yeah

1552
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:47,679
they're one of the biggest legit you

1553
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,760
know I don't they're one of the biggest

1554
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:52,159
brands right now so if you new like

1555
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,520
you've seen their marketing and you

1556
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,798
probably think they're huge yeah well

1557
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:57,719
but the main thing is they're one of the

1558
01:01:55,798 --> 01:02:00,278
only seeds you can buy in

1559
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:02,679
dispensaries that's true yeah that's the

1560
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:04,599
huge thing that they did well no I mean

1561
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,879
they just like put that leg work in too

1562
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:07,960
you know what I mean to get the state

1563
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,960
license on a small little farm oh yeah I

1564
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,079
guess on that you know what I mean

1565
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,720
there's like a game side to all of that

1566
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:15,278
but like the main thing was is that most

1567
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:16,879
people's sales were like Nationwide why

1568
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:19,079
would they sign up for State Licensing

1569
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,240
because that limits you to exclusive

1570
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:22,960
state sales you know what I mean besides

1571
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,118
like backdooring and white labeling

1572
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,278
stuff and so like

1573
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,440
in some ways I can respect the Hustle

1574
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:31,239
but like I also have like more intimate

1575
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,639
knowledge on that stuff and I still

1576
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:33,879
don't like that they stole my blueberry

1577
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:35,558
muffin name and slept it on their

1578
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,760
[ __ ] that wasn't blueberry I did not

1579
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:41,240
like that dude that cut that dark hard

1580
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:44,839
licensed the cut that darkart licens

1581
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:46,798
like I've never liked it like I was like

1582
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:49,199
around for that you know what I mean as

1583
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:51,318
far as like up there in the community

1584
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,159
like a knew people that worked with them

1585
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:55,679
and like did work with them and like

1586
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:57,879
it's just a i never liked that specific

1587
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,558
selection very much at all and I don't

1588
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,720
know why it got circulated so widely and

1589
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,559
I think it's just because nothing

1590
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:06,239
blueberry had been really widely

1591
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:08,039
circulated for a while you know yeah um

1592
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,798
but I think that it's like that

1593
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:12,079
blueberry muffin because it does smell

1594
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:14,038
exactly like baked blueberry muffins or

1595
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,440
like the hostess little mini blueberry

1596
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:18,319
muffin kind of deals you know what I

1597
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,278
mean but I think that's like that's like

1598
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:23,358
C tier blueberry turbs yeah it's it's

1599
01:03:21,278 --> 01:03:25,039
not it's not good it's and I want

1600
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,838
blueberry scissor

1601
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,359
like I got really mad mostly because we

1602
01:03:26,838 --> 01:03:29,880
had spent six years prior to that

1603
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:31,119
building up the blueberry muffin cut

1604
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,640
like showing pictures it was the most

1605
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,760
used picture of blueberry and stolen

1606
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:37,960
picture of blueberry ever and then they

1607
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,520
popped up used the marketing from that

1608
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,119
and the steam from that took it for

1609
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,880
themselves sold the cut to darkart and

1610
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,880
it was just like well there goes that

1611
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,599
and all the [ __ ] that's when I that's

1612
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,559
really when I stopped trying to work on

1613
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:51,160
advertising and marketing of any one

1614
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:53,200
strain or put any kind of effort because

1615
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:54,598
I realized oh the first one to do it

1616
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:56,519
doesn't matter it's the one with the

1617
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:57,838
most money in the marketing that's what

1618
01:03:56,519 --> 01:03:59,119
matters and that's when I realized maybe

1619
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:01,199
I don't even get mad about this [ __ ]

1620
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,278
anymore plus their their marketing is

1621
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:05,759
pretty appealing so I can't that no man

1622
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:07,838
that's the whole thing is that like if

1623
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,720
you can if you can do decent marketing

1624
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:11,400
you can sell a lot of seed it's all

1625
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:13,159
about just like people knowing who you

1626
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,798
are because there's a much wider market

1627
01:04:13,159 --> 01:04:17,399
for people that just want to like

1628
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:19,038
they're like oh I do smoke weed but like

1629
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,760
what's up with the seed thing you know

1630
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,839
what I mean and like bringing new people

1631
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,559
in and I feel like especially in like

1632
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:26,838
California they're in Oregon and they're

1633
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:29,039
like probably the first seed company

1634
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:30,838
that most people first getting into

1635
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,319
growing in the last five years have kind

1636
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:35,078
of come across yeah and um they have

1637
01:04:33,318 --> 01:04:37,519
some decent stuff like I found some

1638
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:39,200
decent stuff in there um but that was

1639
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,960
from like their original stuff before

1640
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,480
they made it big you know like I used to

1641
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,559
buy their some of their seeds at uh yeah

1642
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,318
hprc and Arcada they've been around a

1643
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:51,240
long time that was the other hard part

1644
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:52,639
like yeah taking cuz they they popped up

1645
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:54,519
I had no interaction with them I don't

1646
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:56,440
go up to Humbolt and hang out in Humbolt

1647
01:04:54,519 --> 01:05:00,000
I'm not like a mountain

1648
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:02,119
dude popped up on the main You Are I Am

1649
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,159
trashy when they popped up on the main

1650
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:05,278
seed scene like they were nobody to me

1651
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:07,920
because they weren't involved in the

1652
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:09,480
whole breeding Community worldwide they

1653
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,960
weren't selling seeds worldwide they

1654
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,039
weren't a major seed mover at the time

1655
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,559
so I was just like who the hell are

1656
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:17,000
these people showing up and just taking

1657
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:18,839
the name I thought they were no buddies

1658
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,599
from nowhere you know but they had been

1659
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:23,000
around for a long time up in Humble in

1660
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:25,599
just much more small time than I was but

1661
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,159
they quickly became big

1662
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:31,960
yeah for sure no they their their Farm

1663
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:33,920
is deep too yeah right it's [ __ ] out

1664
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,480
there bro like they do a lot of white

1665
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,798
labing too bro they they buy a lot of

1666
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,599
seeds and repackage them like that's

1667
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:44,159
that's the name that's exactly what they

1668
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:46,760
do now they're seed that's they bought

1669
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,558
my seeds yeah right like I mean that's

1670
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,799
where it ends up white label seeds you

1671
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,880
stop making your own seeds because

1672
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:54,519
there's probably more money in that you

1673
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,440
know realistically no the business

1674
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:58,639
Acumen and the Business site is there

1675
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,278
but it's like the more intimate

1676
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:04,358
knowledge I have of the practices I'm

1677
01:06:00,278 --> 01:06:06,880
like H nah just big fat nah like that's

1678
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:09,318
not how you do

1679
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,318
it um someone here's an interesting one

1680
01:06:09,318 --> 01:06:14,159
here you go you can answer this one

1681
01:06:11,318 --> 01:06:15,759
D anybody know what the longest flower

1682
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:17,318
time is being used in the commercial

1683
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,278
industry I'm hearing everything gets

1684
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:21,920
taken at 8 to nine weeks regardless of

1685
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:24,199
fully ripe anyone doing 10 to 12 plus

1686
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:27,079
week no so what we do you're like kind

1687
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:29,439
of right um I wouldn't say eight is

1688
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:32,880
standard at all I'd say it's more 9 to

1689
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:37,278
10 um and really like on average just

1690
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:39,318
nine like people pick 56 to 63 Day stuff

1691
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:40,838
um but like Skittles and Skittles

1692
01:06:39,318 --> 01:06:42,759
hybrids are the only thing that I take

1693
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:45,119
it eight weeks and what we actually do

1694
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,880
is we stagger to where Skittles goes

1695
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,200
into the room late so that way it's all

1696
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,760
getting harvested at the same time

1697
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:52,439
because that's actually way easier to

1698
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,400
manage um than harvesting something

1699
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,760
separate um but um we do have longer

1700
01:06:55,400 --> 01:07:00,798
flowering stuff but normally what you do

1701
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,440
is you try and cross that to something

1702
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:04,880
that's more normal flowering something

1703
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:07,400
usually gelato based because it'll also

1704
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,079
bulk it up and so I have some stuff that

1705
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,680
started as like 13 14 week flowering

1706
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,400
stuff and within one or two breeding

1707
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,919
Cycles we've broughten that down to 9 to

1708
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:19,880
10 weeks and it still throws down just

1709
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,240
like two x yields of sativa siiz bats um

1710
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,519
like I have some pictures that would

1711
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:24,639
blow your minds of some sativa type

1712
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:28,119
stuff

1713
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:30,278
um actually I was just um saw that

1714
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:32,680
cornbread Ricky had posted about his uh

1715
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:35,079
Legends of Nigeria that cut is [ __ ] that

1716
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:37,118
line is [ __ ] sick like I've worked it

1717
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:39,519
and it's really [ __ ] cool and it it

1718
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:43,039
throws down just like 30 plus percent

1719
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:44,838
THC terpinolene dominant sativa bats and

1720
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,400
so I've had a lot of fun with that line

1721
01:07:44,838 --> 01:07:51,000
and it is uh s tier

1722
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:54,838
smoke s tier is that is that good or bad

1723
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,760
best best oh best tier yeah no s s is

1724
01:07:54,838 --> 01:08:00,318
like it s ABC like you know I don't know

1725
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,400
why that is it's a gaming thing is where

1726
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:04,798
I at

1727
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:09,079
first

1728
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:10,880
local thousand local local other youths

1729
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:13,640
what what was it would know it's like an

1730
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,759
anime thing so I think uh is it an anime

1731
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:20,920
thing originally yeah remember

1732
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:23,359
anime like fighting games oh yeah that's

1733
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,759
that's it yeah yeah yeah cookies four

1734
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:28,719
wings

1735
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:32,838
yeah that's the D speaks and it's

1736
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:35,198
true to be fair I actually like it just

1737
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:37,719
makes me think of like uh harvesting

1738
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,198
something in a non- average window like

1739
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:43,000
seven to eight weeks even though it is a

1740
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:45,639
nine we strain based on hash processing

1741
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,198
oil extraction all of that kind of stuff

1742
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:51,359
um yeah or just like um bumping up tests

1743
01:08:48,198 --> 01:08:54,318
I've recently seen it where a like 29%

1744
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,520
THC really like uh

1745
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,319
that's like kind of the higher end of

1746
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,759
what I like usually will expect out of a

1747
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:02,239
commercial hybrid um and then you take

1748
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:06,238
it at week seven for hash and you test

1749
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,238
the flower and it tests at 39%

1750
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:12,079
THC you know and like 48% total can

1751
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,158
avonoids and I'm like but it's just

1752
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:16,399
because the flower mass is not developed

1753
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:18,000
and so it's technically true you know

1754
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:19,838
what I mean and then you see the same

1755
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,158
thing from a standard pole versus an

1756
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:23,960
early pole and it's like it's so much

1757
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,879
more filled out like I was just looking

1758
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,359
at samples today that was like something

1759
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,920
harvested 14 days before the other and

1760
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:32,719
like but the same clone and like the

1761
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,838
difference of it is like you wouldn't

1762
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,880
expect it to be that much mass and size

1763
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:38,600
but it's genuinely like the three quter

1764
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:41,079
version of the other one and half as

1765
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:43,759
dense yeah

1766
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:45,119
so here's one here you guys can answer

1767
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,039
this

1768
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,559
one any of you consider being

1769
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:51,920
interviewed on someone else's podcast I

1770
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,880
mean like maybe but no like I mean I

1771
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,840
just like know my boys and know my Carew

1772
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,960
and like know what I can and can't say

1773
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,079
and the the whole thing with like the

1774
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,079
cultural norms like I at least try and

1775
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:05,880
upkeep it even though it's not like very

1776
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:08,600
standard anymore is that it's just like

1777
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:12,079
um it's hard to know what you can say

1778
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:15,640
around what people in this industry and

1779
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:17,519
so blacklisted like me bro yeah or just

1780
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,719
like I don't want to like out myself in

1781
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,000
some stupid way or like you know what I

1782
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:24,239
mean like I've signed paperwork and [ __ ]

1783
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,719
so um

1784
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,839
for me it's a

1785
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:31,198
no that's gonna be a no dog no I'm just

1786
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,880
kidding um I've done him but like I'm

1787
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,879
pretty picky like if someone interviews

1788
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,039
a bunch of [ __ ] lames and scammers

1789
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,159
and then's like hey you want to come on

1790
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:39,399
my PO I won't do it just because I don't

1791
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:40,960
want to be associated with the same

1792
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:44,439
group of [ __ ] and that's been the

1793
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,439
biggest problem so

1794
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:51,799
far but you know I mean like that that's

1795
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:52,920
just my anal way that I am you know I

1796
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,199
these guys are more than welcome to you

1797
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:58,119
on any podcast I think it'd be

1798
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:59,599
good I don't I don't see any context in

1799
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:01,399
which it would make sense for me to be

1800
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,640
interviewed

1801
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:04,799
so I mean I think the same thing with me

1802
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,800
I what else am I gonna say that I

1803
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,400
haven't already

1804
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:10,239
said

1805
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:12,559
same yeah just one of those things I

1806
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:16,519
there aren't many podcasts like other

1807
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:19,400
than like Boo podcast Matt booze

1808
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,760
um uh yeah there's so few that I would

1809
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:24,158
even be interested in

1810
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,119
doing you know what I mean never heard

1811
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:28,119
that booze has a wait booze has a

1812
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:31,279
podcast

1813
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:33,079
yes oh he did okay I'm not sure can give

1814
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,198
you a bit of context yeah so he he

1815
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:37,840
started one I think they they have a few

1816
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,158
episodes but he got really busy and then

1817
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,600
the idea was that he would actually join

1818
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:42,960
forces with us essentially um but he's

1819
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,480
still really busy so we're just kind of

1820
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,279
waiting for him to like for his life to

1821
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:51,000
give him a break yeah feel you on that

1822
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:51,000
booze so we

1823
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,199
stolen but yeah I don't know I mean like

1824
01:11:54,279 --> 01:12:00,000
I I did the podcast most people know

1825
01:11:56,198 --> 01:12:02,399
that but I wasn't necessarily super

1826
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,840
stoked D I can tell you a story about

1827
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,119
that it just pequs my memory there so I

1828
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,000
was uh I was moving away from Eugene

1829
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,238
Oregon and I'm driving out to [ __ ]

1830
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,079
Oklahoma and so like I didn't know a lot

1831
01:12:11,238 --> 01:12:15,559
of weed podcasts yet but I like

1832
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:17,399
downloaded a [ __ ] ton of episodes of the

1833
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:20,679
podcast and that was the first time I

1834
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:24,960
had come across you and so this is

1835
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:26,399
2020 and um uh anyway I just remember

1836
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,760
listening to it and I'm like driving

1837
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,479
through the Cascade Mountains on day one

1838
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,560
and I'm just like listening to you to

1839
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:35,319
talk so much [ __ ] [ __ ] about everyone

1840
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,239
in the industry and I was like this is

1841
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:40,238
my

1842
01:12:37,238 --> 01:12:41,839
guy [ __ ] these guys he's saying

1843
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:44,198
everything that I think when I'm

1844
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,760
scrolling through IG [ __ ] this

1845
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:48,960
is my dude and so like yeah that's just

1846
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,480
funny how it all works around in that in

1847
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,119
these weird ways in life you know what I

1848
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:54,479
mean that it's just like I hear you on a

1849
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:56,039
podcast I knew we'd be friends and then

1850
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:57,759
like years down the line it's just like

1851
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:59,760
yo what's up D and then we ended up

1852
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,239
[ __ ] it was so weird yeah I know

1853
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,560
right yeah it's so crazy now I know what

1854
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:06,319
your ass smells like

1855
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:08,560
it's yeah I don't know you know like I I

1856
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,039
I never relisten to my podcast episode

1857
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,000
so I don't even remember what I said but

1858
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:14,439
I just know how I am could and and if

1859
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,079
people ask me certain questions there's

1860
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:19,399
no doubt that I'm gonna say something

1861
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:21,840
[ __ ] up you bro I listened to I

1862
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:23,839
relisten to my first one I was just like

1863
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,520
I don't want to get fired so so like

1864
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,560
what did I actually say prob be a good

1865
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:32,280
idea right I have to screen myself and

1866
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:35,880
it's too late even if I did you know

1867
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:38,198
yeah yeah I think it's also just like

1868
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,039
it's hard because podcasts like for

1869
01:13:38,198 --> 01:13:42,960
example with the podcast he interviewed

1870
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:46,439
some like legitimate people at the

1871
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:49,480
beginning and I I was okay to be with a

1872
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:51,638
part of that but like after me like you

1873
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:55,039
know interviewing straight up scammers

1874
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:56,679
straight up Liars tweakers just like and

1875
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:58,359
then people start saying oh you were on

1876
01:13:56,679 --> 01:14:00,000
that show same show you're friends with

1877
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:01,559
that guy you must be if he interviewed

1878
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,679
you you must be friends with the other

1879
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,639
people interviews and that people really

1880
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,319
make those associations and like I

1881
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:08,880
hadn't forethought that I hadn't thought

1882
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:11,479
about that in advance and that's when I

1883
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:13,480
started to be more protective about what

1884
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:15,238
shows I went on and some people take it

1885
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:16,638
[ __ ] sideways when I'm like no I'm

1886
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:18,439
not going to do that show you interview

1887
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:20,239
too many scammers like and that's not

1888
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,559
what they want to hear right you know

1889
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:23,599
nobody wants to hear that and I'm an

1890
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,800
[ __ ] for it but it just is what it is

1891
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,440
I don't I don't want to have my name

1892
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,440
next to a bunch of

1893
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:34,520
[ __ ] yeah there's oh shout out Steve

1894
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:36,400
long that's my UFO buddy he's the UFO

1895
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,440
master I'm just like sitting here

1896
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:40,079
reading the chat and like outside the

1897
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:42,000
blocks it's like yeah it sucks that we

1898
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:44,840
can't have real conversations for like

1899
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,679
fear of consequences and it's uh but

1900
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:49,960
it's it's really true like there's some

1901
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:52,279
things that I will 100% say to the

1902
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,960
Discord or on like certain groupings of

1903
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:56,319
people within the Discord

1904
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:58,600
that I would never say on the show for

1905
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:00,439
sure you know what I mean and then like

1906
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,800
there's other things that like and it it

1907
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:03,759
just goes down the line like that it's

1908
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,520
like what I say on Instagram is like by

1909
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:09,840
far the most like like you know

1910
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:12,679
cultivated and marketed way of saying it

1911
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,079
you know possible but it's just like um

1912
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:16,840
I don't know join the Discord you'll

1913
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:19,119
learn some [ __ ] yeah I guess I'm I'm

1914
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,560
more open there too like I used to be

1915
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:24,559
just all out unfiltered whatever but

1916
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:26,880
even on Instagram over time like it

1917
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,639
alienates me from friends who happen to

1918
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,359
not be as stringent with who they let

1919
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:34,239
around them like a lot of friends that I

1920
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:36,880
have are friends with shitbags and when

1921
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:38,839
I say something publicly that [ __ ]

1922
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,880
goes in [ __ ] to this person you know

1923
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,719
so it causes a lot of problems and then

1924
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,279
then you know just straight up people

1925
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:47,800
will snitch on you they'll call the cops

1926
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,719
on you have your house wanted do wild

1927
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,199
[ __ ] just because you're interfering

1928
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:55,239
with their scammy money so

1929
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:57,638
yeah let's see do any of you oh here's a

1930
01:15:55,238 --> 01:15:59,479
good one any of you accidentally breed

1931
01:15:57,639 --> 01:16:01,159
out traits that you didn't want to lose

1932
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:03,839
what would you do about that that's when

1933
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:06,198
you start over and always keep your um

1934
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,079
you keep each generation and some seed

1935
01:16:06,198 --> 01:16:10,960
from each so you can go back and and try

1936
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:13,719
to correct that um that's really all you

1937
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,600
can do if you lose lose lose a trait

1938
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:18,600
there's no going forward to get it back

1939
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,360
most of the time it's gone so the only

1940
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,360
way to do it is to go

1941
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,560
backwards yeah

1942
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:28,079
yep and it really sucks because a lot of

1943
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,520
times it's like everything in life uh

1944
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:31,319
the things that you really wish you can

1945
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,159
go back to are like just Out Of Reach

1946
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:35,279
you're like ah [ __ ] I didn't save that

1947
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:38,000
one generation or I didn't save that

1948
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:41,519
oldest one you

1949
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,158
know uh for example my my RAB Berry that

1950
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,880
was my favorite blueberry line but there

1951
01:16:43,158 --> 01:16:48,599
was a lot of stuff with it that I didn't

1952
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,600
like which is why another reason I

1953
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,560
didn't just go back ask some friends for

1954
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,719
Old Stock and do work it from that

1955
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,440
generation

1956
01:16:53,719 --> 01:16:58,399
it was missing resin production and it

1957
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,519
was missing recreational potency and no

1958
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:02,519
matter what I did I could not bring up

1959
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:04,800
resin production and I could not bring

1960
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:06,600
up recreational potency without losing

1961
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,520
the blueberry turbs the extreme Berry

1962
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:11,320
turbs yeah um and because I didn't keep

1963
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,800
all those seeds for myself or previous

1964
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:14,840
generations it's not like I could just

1965
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,560
go oh I'll just go back and po it I sold

1966
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,679
them all you know because people wanted

1967
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,840
them at the time I was like okay I'll

1968
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,119
SoMo what the [ __ ] you you know someone

1969
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,639
else can take it further um and that's

1970
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:26,479
one of those cases where had to go do

1971
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:29,000
the hard thing and start from scratch

1972
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:31,519
again yeah my key Li work I don't have

1973
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,158
any of the original steps anymore I've

1974
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,600
popped them all because I've like you

1975
01:17:33,158 --> 01:17:36,559
know what I mean you work something for

1976
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:39,440
a year or two and then you kind of drop

1977
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:42,679
it and move on to something else and um

1978
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:44,719
I just never kept any of those

1979
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:46,639
intermediates I've used up all the other

1980
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,158
stuff like the back stock and the BX ons

1981
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:51,079
and things like that and so I'm just

1982
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:54,000
like it's gone yeah sometimes that's

1983
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:56,039
just how it goes you know

1984
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,039
um what was the first Blue Bonnet hybrid

1985
01:17:56,039 --> 01:18:01,198
you

1986
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:04,198
tried that's a good question first the

1987
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:06,399
first one to come down that wasn't

1988
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:08,198
seated I want to say it was the blue

1989
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:12,839
aside was the first one I went for which

1990
01:18:08,198 --> 01:18:14,960
was the fake Irene cross the blue bonnet

1991
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,600
um that's got to be the first one and I

1992
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,239
was stoked because it was so Berry you

1993
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,639
know like I was like got it nailed it

1994
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:21,879
you know first thing first thing I'm

1995
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:24,679
harvesting but by that time the whole

1996
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:26,000
room smelled ber so knew that but the um

1997
01:18:24,679 --> 01:18:27,520
that was the first time I realized that

1998
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,439
there were that there was recreational

1999
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:33,440
potency too and extreme resin production

2000
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,439
which was missing from the other

2001
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,158
ones yeah you know um with the Discord

2002
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,719
there's always going to be some concerns

2003
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:41,479
like this you know like I'm in

2004
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:45,198
prohibition land whatever I'm I'm

2005
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:46,879
hesitant to do that I do do my best to

2006
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:49,638
to keep that in mind because a lot of

2007
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:52,679
people in the Discord are from

2008
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:54,960
prohibition places and that's why there

2009
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:58,199
is such heavy safety in there and we try

2010
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,719
to keep it very very tight um even with

2011
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:02,238
there there are some people in there

2012
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:04,880
that seem to be nice but could be a

2013
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:07,759
liability to other people in there with

2014
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,760
how they behave we make that decision to

2015
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,920
remove them and it's just a way it goes

2016
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,000
because we we give a [ __ ] about

2017
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,719
everybody safy that's important and

2018
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,000
first foremost you know I'm sorry

2019
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:20,000
bitter's comment is just too good B

2020
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:27,120
is when you play count Ned

2021
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:29,639
bro favorite no there's a lot of people

2022
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:32,198
like you can still chat and be koi and

2023
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:33,719
people understand too on the Discord you

2024
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:36,119
know I especially when you're first

2025
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:38,158
getting acquainted like I think I lurked

2026
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:40,399
for about a year on the Discord before I

2027
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,158
really started dming and reaching out to

2028
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:44,279
people and I'd been listening to the

2029
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:48,119
show for like a year before that you

2030
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:49,439
know and so um there's no like oh this

2031
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:51,519
is a good

2032
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:53,439
one yeah I mean we've done a show on

2033
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:56,639
Ohio we've actually done done a show on

2034
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:58,759
Ohio weed history with pips weed yeah oh

2035
01:19:56,639 --> 01:20:00,520
oh okay yeah yeah that's right covered a

2036
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:03,039
lot of it there because I don't have any

2037
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:06,120
direct he's our boots on the ground Ohio

2038
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:07,719
dude and he's very very into history so

2039
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:10,158
we went over the cuts that he has that

2040
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:12,880
he has the most familiar in the Ohio

2041
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:15,839
Legend I have to say that I have met a

2042
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:18,039
[ __ ] ton of people from Ohio and humble

2043
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,719
there are so many people from Ohio and

2044
01:20:18,039 --> 01:20:24,119
New York and humble and uh um little

2045
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:25,920
quick tangent like we ran a barber shop

2046
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:27,920
that someone sold their weed farm and

2047
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,279
like bought a barber shop for and it's

2048
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,279
called the trim Scene It was sick as

2049
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,359
[ __ ] here we go uh Dan you want this one

2050
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,560
do you take into consideration whether

2051
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:39,359
things like weight time and other

2052
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,039
factors for production growing are maybe

2053
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:43,439
having an effect on overall gene pool of

2054
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,560
cannabis especially compared to oh bro

2055
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:47,079
they're like the number one thing

2056
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,760
steering the genan pool like that's what

2057
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:52,760
I was talking about and I think it was

2058
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:55,440
the selection episode I did with booze

2059
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,440
and local um where I was talking about

2060
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:59,479
the process itself being its own

2061
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:00,879
selection pressure where it's like if it

2062
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,439
doesn't fit into the commercial

2063
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,239
production model then it's not going to

2064
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:06,158
get selected because like most of the

2065
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:08,359
time like if say it's too slow like it's

2066
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,719
a nice little runty plant that if you

2067
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:12,839
baby it it produces just this incredible

2068
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:15,039
smoke it'll never even make it into

2069
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,480
flour because it didn't grow fast enough

2070
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:20,279
to get cloned before the rest of the

2071
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:23,238
main batch went because like um I don't

2072
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:26,039
have time in our schedule and our speed

2073
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:29,319
of work to um

2074
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:31,639
um like wait for any individual plant

2075
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:33,519
you know if I pop 600 seeds and a

2076
01:21:31,639 --> 01:21:35,600
hundred of them don't make the cut

2077
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:39,520
deadline that's 100 plants that get cut

2078
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:42,000
off the roster yeah every single time

2079
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,639
and so and that's just how it works now

2080
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,439
and I know other groups depending on

2081
01:21:43,639 --> 01:21:47,279
their size like there's no actual like

2082
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:49,479
standardized model for a breeding

2083
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:52,679
program within canab commercial cannabis

2084
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:54,238
companies it's still very informal like

2085
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:58,719
I would say the program that I work

2086
01:21:54,238 --> 01:22:01,079
within is probably like one of the more

2087
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:03,039
stringently like structured ones you

2088
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:05,319
know what I mean most of the time it's

2089
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:08,760
still the owner of the company knows a

2090
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:10,119
guy yeah and homie makes seeds you know

2091
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:12,880
what I mean and maybe they make good

2092
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:14,639
seeds you know what I mean but like um

2093
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,159
it's usually how it works and most

2094
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,920
people don't even want to allocate the

2095
01:22:16,158 --> 01:22:19,839
funds to research and development and

2096
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,239
they just buy whatever the nursery has

2097
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,239
available this year and they're like we

2098
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:24,519
got new Cuts we got that TR cherry and

2099
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:26,799
you're like cool everyone's got trop

2100
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:28,760
Cherry yeah you know what I mean like

2101
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:32,320
you got that gorilla titties you got

2102
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:35,000
that that orangutang titties B yeah but

2103
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:37,319
it's just like if if most like when you

2104
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,279
look across the state like in California

2105
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:41,840
specifically where I work um and you see

2106
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:43,880
the commercial offerings from the

2107
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,840
nurseries you're going to find the same

2108
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,760
20 to 30 Cuts usually on a given year

2109
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:51,039
and like it'll rotate out two or three

2110
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,480
times a year but like they rotate in the

2111
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:55,840
same Cuts you know what I I mean yeah

2112
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:58,359
and so like what I see is when we get a

2113
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,039
new cut I can directly go on IG and

2114
01:22:58,359 --> 01:23:01,679
someone else like I can find three or

2115
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:04,479
four other people that just got the same

2116
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:07,279
exact cut you know what I mean and it's

2117
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:09,718
it's like that every single time and so

2118
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:12,319
uh it's a it's just how it is now you

2119
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:12,319
know and

2120
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:18,319
so um someone's asking about p&amp;w

2121
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:20,480
breeders I mean there's archive like

2122
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:23,599
he's from the p&amp;w and his specialty is

2123
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:25,359
pnw historical strains someone mentioned

2124
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,199
a company in here I've never heard of

2125
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:28,880
them so I don't really like to send

2126
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:31,599
people to companies I've never heard of

2127
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,279
because been around long enough and seen

2128
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,760
enough companies come and go that if I

2129
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:37,079
don't know someone that means they

2130
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:39,360
probably not that old or haven't been at

2131
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:41,960
it that long you know what I mean um I

2132
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,479
would definitely say archive uh CSI also

2133
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:46,560
has a large collection of Pacific

2134
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:48,799
Northwest heirloom um stick to stuff

2135
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:53,360
that does well in humidity you know fast

2136
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:56,840
flowering low or high humidity strain so

2137
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:58,839
don't go for kushes you know essentially

2138
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,159
um I do like recommending a lot of Next

2139
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:03,800
Generation seed stuff like the Canadian

2140
01:24:01,158 --> 01:24:05,599
stuff for uh humid environments whether

2141
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,480
that's New York Pacific Northwest

2142
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:10,159
anything on that parallel um Next

2143
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:12,479
Generation makes great [ __ ] man it

2144
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:14,359
really do it's it's hard to uh send

2145
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:16,718
anyone else anywhere for like high

2146
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:17,519
humidity or yeah high humidity type

2147
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,119
conditions because that's what that

2148
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,800
stuff spread for is outdoor high

2149
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,319
humidity um also there's hybrids from

2150
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,000
hell

2151
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:27,399
he does great work a lot of the Swiss

2152
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,600
sativas uh stuff like that do Great

2153
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:31,599
Outdoors Mighty might yeah all that

2154
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:37,840
[ __ ] uh one from

2155
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:40,079
Ellice on now is

2156
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:43,319
poison it's a pretty common question I

2157
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:45,118
think no no Durban Poison itself is not

2158
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:48,319
a pure African heirloom is best I of

2159
01:24:45,118 --> 01:24:52,519
aware Durban is a place in South Africa

2160
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:56,039
that is a large commercial area for

2161
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:59,280
cannabis for commercial so beers would

2162
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:01,960
be like Durban and um swasi and stuff

2163
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:04,118
like that Durban Poison if I remember

2164
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:07,158
correctly was first released by Dutch

2165
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:09,599
Passion it would be Durban land race

2166
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:12,319
skunk one

2167
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,600
um no just like you're not going to run

2168
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:15,920
into pure land race Durban Poison

2169
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,400
there's not a specific strain called

2170
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:21,199
Durban Poison Durban has all sorts of

2171
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:22,920
different Expressions it's a it's an

2172
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:25,879
area it's not a

2173
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:28,319
strain um so yeah you're going to see

2174
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,319
all kinds of

2175
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,399
different uh let's see uh mat

2176
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:36,439
interviewed Carill and talked about

2177
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:38,000
where everyone in Amsterdam got their

2178
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:39,238
Durban he said from a coffee shop so

2179
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,880
there was a Durban coffee shop that's

2180
01:25:39,238 --> 01:25:42,678
where they got theirs they said their

2181
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:45,760
Durban was different from the one Mel

2182
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:49,359
Frank provided um Mel Franks I believe

2183
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,840
went to sensy and Seedbank but Dutch

2184
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,880
Passion or not Dutch Passion I'm sorry

2185

2186
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,440
totally different one and that interview

2187
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:58,639

are

2210
01:26:44,118 --> 01:26:47,559

01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:06,559
the stuff like that's like the work that

2218
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,719
I get excited about is when I have some

2219
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,080
new age cut like the papaya cut that I

2220
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,239
always talk about like I love that

2221
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:15,639

2231
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,000
like trying to introgress the traits

2232
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:45,960
that from the old school into like a

2233
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,039
modern frame and production model yeah

2234
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,118

just because he's got a you know he's

2236
01:27:50,118 --> 01:27:54,118
recently I feel had like a really good

2237
01:27:54,198 --> 01:27:59,359
um range of range of range of things

2238
01:27:57,319 --> 01:28:03,799
that he can look

2239
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,799
through um

2240
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:10,678
so yeah I kind of know what I know um

2241
01:28:08,198 --> 01:28:13,599
I've seemed to kind of stick with things

2242
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:15,480
that are like older on a genetic

2243
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:19,239
timeline

2244
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:22,799
um and you know I kind of seem to prefer

2245
01:28:19,238 --> 01:28:25,000
those over a lot of the newer hybrids um

2246
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,679
you know like I do [ __ ] with like some

2247
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:31,800
of the Skittles S1 stuff the Sher you

2248
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:34,679
know that stuff is nice but it's not as

2249
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:36,920
good um I don't know they're like for

2250
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:39,719
example like that sweet bee stuff I mean

2251
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:42,560
that shit's phenomenal um Santa Cruz

2252
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:47,279
Rick I mean I would totally put that and

2253
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:49,880
you know and the old flavor realm um and

2254
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:53,800
I I think that shit's pretty [ __ ]

2255
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:55,480
spectacular um yeah I don't know you

2256
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:59,719
have someone called Luna in the chat

2257
01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:59,718
shouting out you Santa Cruz Rick I

2258
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:06,359
believe but yeah there you

2259
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,039
go yeah I've been smoking locals Santa

2260
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:11,839
Cruz recro it's good man it's really

2261
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:14,079
good and then the um the electric Baloo

2262
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,679
uh Appalachia aka dog [ __ ] Appalachia

2263
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:17,719
from high and lonon that shit's fire

2264
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:19,840
like it it smells like traditional old

2265
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:24,079
hazy

2266
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:25,719
stuff that's super cool yeah I dig it

2267
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:28,639
there's a bunch that I bookmarked up

2268
01:29:25,719 --> 01:29:33,279
here star number one tip for growing OG

2269
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:35,760
ceg bro um what else do we got

2270
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:37,158
uh coming out any of you have tried and

2271
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,679
like you're Sting with tried and true

2272
01:29:37,158 --> 01:29:42,879
new stuff coming out that any of us have

2273
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:45,000
liked you guys go

2274
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,400
ahead I don't have much experience with

2275
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
it what did you say any new stuff that

2276
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:50,759
you've liked that like really ticked

2277
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,520
your boxes like other than the papaya

2278
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:56,119
obviously uh um [ __ ] a I'm trying to

2279
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:58,920
think I know there's a few we just have

2280
01:29:56,118 --> 01:30:01,920
like so much stuff that rolls

2281
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,920
through

2282
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:06,880
um [ __ ] man like nothing's coming to

2283
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,238
mind that's like actually new like when

2284
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:13,639
I think new I think like gelato era like

2285
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:15,559
2016 you know yeah and so like a lot of

2286
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:17,600
stuff that I see now is just like

2287
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:20,280
honestly reworked versions of that and

2288
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,520
reworked flavors of that and so I put it

2289
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:24,198
into the same exact category like

2290
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:26,360
there's a cut called White peaches that

2291
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:28,759
goes around that's like you know it's a

2292
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:30,719
little peachery gelato you know what I

2293
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,199
mean but like my mind just automatically

2294
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:35,520
is like yeah nice gelato uh the

2295
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:37,479
permanent marker man I actually [ __ ]

2296
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,040
like it and every time I get another jar

2297
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:41,678
I'm like [ __ ] this is some good [ __ ]

2298
01:30:40,039 --> 01:30:43,960
right until you smoke it for like two

2299
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:46,480
days not bro I've been smoking it every

2300
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:48,079
night for a few weeks now that's how my

2301
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:50,319
first jar was from that batch that I

2302
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:52,238
sent you but I've got some batches from

2303
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:55,238
other facilities that I think hold up a

2304
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:57,000
little better and so um it's just it's

2305
01:30:55,238 --> 01:30:59,479
it's funny man like I don't know it's

2306
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,960
just [ __ ] I love that permanent marker

2307
01:30:59,479 --> 01:31:03,238
smoke it wasn't

2308
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,039
bad yeah it was and what I do is I

2309
01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:06,519
flavor it with other stuff you know what

2310
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,719
I mean so like I've been doing these

2311
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:11,400
mixers of permanent marker and different

2312
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:13,800
Zs ones which is really nice um I'll

2313
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:16,920
throw some OG on there for some extra

2314
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:19,760
potency you

2315
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,639
know you find Li's bre L's bread under

2316
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,600
HPS can misbehave or not express problem

2317
01:31:21,639 --> 01:31:26,440
I think anything behaves properly I

2318
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:28,639
think the question is actually just act

2319
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:32,479
asked wrong I think is do you find that

2320
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:34,840
lines selected under HPS can misbehave

2321
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:38,359
not expressed properly under LED and

2322
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:41,159
that I will 100% say [ __ ] yeah bro like

2323
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:45,880
I I've been working with LEDs at scale

2324
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:48,279
since 2018 or 2017 and it's been a

2325
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:50,319
Non-Stop battle when you get an older

2326
01:31:48,279 --> 01:31:52,479
cut to try and figure out how to do the

2327
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:55,359
settings because you have like a lot of

2328
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:56,959
control in a lot of instances and so um

2329
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:59,079
dialing in those settings especially for

2330
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:02,239
older cuts that were guaranteed selected

2331
01:31:59,079 --> 01:32:04,319
under like single-ended 600 watt HPS

2332
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:07,158
like they don't want to get hit with

2333
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:12,158
that you know 800 to

2334
01:32:07,158 --> 01:32:14,638
18800 um micro Mo light you know so

2335
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:16,439
yeah yeah I don't run LEDs so I wouldn't

2336
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:18,159
know I I I'm just [ __ ] around you

2337
01:32:16,439 --> 01:32:20,399
should with how [ __ ] hot it is where

2338
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:21,839
you live bro I know I just nobody

2339
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:26,279
sponsors me with him and I'm a broke

2340
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:30,520
folk you know po I own CMH and T5 and

2341
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:33,920
other C is I've run CMH with lower total

2342
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:35,679
wattage in hot areas too and um I've

2343
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,600
gotten really Great Expressions out of

2344
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,079
it and so as well I haven't moved yet

2345
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,880
because it was just as effective for me

2346
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,679
but realistically with the heat yeah

2347
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:45,440
definitely I need to look it yeah

2348
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,239
especially with how far they've come

2349
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:50,719
someone asked about Jaws jaws is a bit

2350
01:32:47,238 --> 01:32:53,359
Mike 138 do you really mix HPS LED and

2351
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:54,920
UVB I mean I guarantee you it is better

2352
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:56,639
than any of the individuals you know

2353
01:32:54,920 --> 01:33:00,279
what I mean but what's

2354
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:02,279
UVB um UVB is just it's another spectrum

2355
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:04,118
of UV light and so like you have to have

2356
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:05,840
special fixtures for that and then a lot

2357
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:07,719
of times they'll have specific diodes

2358
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,760
like if you have a if you look on like

2359
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:11,800
an LED bar you're going to see usually

2360
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,719
like blue white and red diodes but then

2361
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,600
there's going to be some that look like

2362
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:17,719
there's no light coming out of them but

2363
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:22,560
those are actually the UV diodes because

2364
01:33:17,719 --> 01:33:23,960
you can't see UV light that makes sense

2365
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,000
yeah I didn't I just I'm not familiar

2366
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:28,920
with lights like that that's new to me

2367
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,920
that that's new

2368
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:35,439
tech yeah that's what's up man yeah

2369
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:38,439
that's a cool idea I've always wanted to

2370
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:42,678
do it I've done CMH mixed with HPS but

2371
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:45,279
never LED mixed with HID

2372
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:46,880
lighting yeah I just I don't know man

2373
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:49,759
LED was so expensive when I was first

2374
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:52,560
looking into it and I was a part of that

2375
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,560
wave where when LED first got got sold

2376
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,960
to the community it was really expensive

2377
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:59,520
and it was all that blurple UFO light

2378
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,399
stuff and like I think that that put a

2379
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,760
major dent on a lot of people that like

2380
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:04,559
immediately jumped into it and spent a

2381
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,719
bunch of money like that turned a lot of

2382
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,800
people off to LED for a long time it's

2383
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,679
definitely taken until maybe the past

2384
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,840
few years for a lot of people that that

2385
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:14,039
experienced that to even try it again

2386
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,079
because a lot of people spent a lot of

2387
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:18,479
money on that [ __ ] at first yeah the

2388
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:19,960
blur pool's not inherently bad though

2389
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:23,039
like you guys have seen some of my

2390
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:24,920
pictures from uh the my seed production

2391
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:27,000
room where they're like kind of pink

2392
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:32,239
blurple lights in there those are like

2393
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:34,198
the GE like 4 foot um they're like giant

2394
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:35,759
one giant light bar you know what I mean

2395
01:34:34,198 --> 01:34:38,960
that sits above a 4 by eight and you

2396
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:41,800
have two of them over a 4 by8 um and so

2397
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,359
it's kind of like the fluence razors is

2398
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:46,639
like what comes to mind to like compare

2399
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:48,639
it to um and so I've actually grow

2400
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,560
really [ __ ] fire weed like every time

2401
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:52,639
pollen doesn't take I'm like you can be

2402
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,320
some all right smoke like I don't

2403
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:57,719
actually find that high Nitro smoke um

2404
01:34:55,319 --> 01:34:59,519
coming off of a a plant that was meant

2405
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:01,279
to be pollinated but it didn't take you

2406
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,440
know what I mean I actually haven't

2407
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:05,960
found that it's really that bad if you

2408
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:08,559
car it right like obviously if you put

2409
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,439
it into yeah like it's not inherently

2410
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,239
bad and what I've noticed is that in

2411
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:15,319
like certain commercial production

2412
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:17,839
methods and like setups you don't get

2413
01:35:15,319 --> 01:35:19,198
gas as readily you know what I mean like

2414
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:22,760
gas is actually kind of a hard

2415
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:25,319
expression to nail down in a giant fa

2416
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:27,119
um and a lot of it genetics but like I

2417
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:28,799
can take something that's like pure gas

2418
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:30,238
and make it not gassy by putting it

2419
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,719
under our commercial pressure you know

2420
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:35,000
what I mean oh I bet and so uh when I

2421
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:37,439
grow it under those with high Nitro feed

2422
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,079
they're like the rankest nastiest most

2423
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:43,319
fuy version of themsel possible

2424
01:35:41,079 --> 01:35:44,679
yeah gas is a hard one to lock down

2425
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:46,359
that's why you don't see a lot of gassy

2426
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:49,079
OG either like people just growing it

2427
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:52,079
all midy commercial dude yeah that's

2428
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:55,479
what not I'm not even joking I tested

2429
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:57,639
out probably like 10 different OG Cuts

2430
01:35:55,479 --> 01:35:59,879
recently under our method and like it

2431
01:35:57,639 --> 01:36:01,400
just doesn't it doesn't do it and then I

2432
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,239
take every single one of those and if I

2433
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:04,118
put it in that that seed production room

2434
01:36:03,238 --> 01:36:08,359
it's

2435
01:36:04,118 --> 01:36:11,479
[ __ ] fire yeah exactly so it's just

2436
01:36:08,359 --> 01:36:13,039
like that hom grow attention and like

2437
01:36:11,479 --> 01:36:14,959
maybe a feed difference but there's just

2438
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:17,238
so many different variables between you

2439
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:20,118
know like a 100 Lightroom and a three

2440
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:20,118
Lightroom or a four

2441
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:24,319
Lightroom

2442
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:26,239
here's one anything anybody know

2443
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:27,799
anything about Pincher Creek Kush with

2444
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:30,319
the sea possibly the original Green

2445
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:33,639
Crack came out of indor in southern

2446
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:35,679
Alber no there's no Alberta Canada green

2447
01:36:33,639 --> 01:36:39,079
CRA sorry that's not

2448
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:40,719
gonna that kush with a SE baby yeah you

2449
01:36:39,079 --> 01:36:42,639
know like the first time I heard that

2450
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:44,399
story like the first time I saw the cut

2451
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:47,960
of green crack it was called Kush with

2452
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:51,479
the sea green Kush with the SE and um

2453
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:53,840
during that time Cecil had somehow told

2454
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:57,039
someone he thought that was his cut and

2455
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:59,520
been renamed Green Crack uh L later

2456
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:01,399
years later we talked and his cut of

2457
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,760
kush with the sea he said was skunky and

2458
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:07,920
green crack is not skunky at all it's

2459
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:09,639
mango um skunky mango but mostly mango

2460
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,840
and uh it was not a part of the tur

2461
01:37:09,639 --> 01:37:14,440
profile of his Kush so Cecil C does not

2462
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:17,560
have anything to do with green crack nor

2463
01:37:14,439 --> 01:37:19,799
does like is Kush with a sea but that

2464
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:22,520
story seems to travel with it for a long

2465
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,440
ways um do know that the cut when it

2466
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,080
made it to to California was kush with a

2467
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:29,439
sea and most people prefer to call it

2468
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:31,840
green Kush with a SE because the crack

2469
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:34,000
name was not popular in collectives

2470
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:36,000
people didn't like s like

2471
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,800
that what lead you to believe Green

2472
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,920
Crack is a skunk one mango how it grows

2473
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,719
seen a lot of skunk one skunk one

2474
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,719
dominant whatever it

2475
01:37:45,639 --> 01:37:50,159
is man I just want to point out that you

2476
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:52,480
were cutting out in Little Bits when you

2477
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:55,158
turn your head too far oh

2478
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:57,959
there um I wanted to talk real quick

2479
01:37:55,158 --> 01:37:59,799
just the back to the skunk one thing is

2480
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:02,599
that that papaya is really similar to

2481
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:05,239
Green Crack and uh what it does is the

2482
01:38:02,599 --> 01:38:07,920
same kind of thing as it's the mango

2483
01:38:05,238 --> 01:38:11,118
sour candy kind of thing but it has a

2484
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:13,719
very prominent cheesy note to it that's

2485
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:17,759
in that background Beyond it's just like

2486
01:38:13,719 --> 01:38:20,000
General look too yeah it's very like

2487
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,280
green crack skunk one as [ __ ] like if

2488
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,800
you have a lot of experience with skunk

2489
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:25,039
one you'll smell it from there here's

2490
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:28,079
another interesting one I don't know if

2491
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:31,118
you guys know anything about the PPP

2492
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:34,760
pona purple paralyzer I believe it's the

2493
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:38,279
original name no I only know about my

2494
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:43,360
PP the best story I've ever heard on it

2495
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:46,000
was from um Stacy Stacy uh Mueller from

2496
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:49,799
overgrow and he's a legit dude and he

2497
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,279
had some um where the seeds were from

2498
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:54,119
Netherland purple IND

2499
01:38:52,279 --> 01:38:55,399
and I if I remember correctly and I

2500
01:38:54,118 --> 01:38:57,799
don't want to misquote him because he's

2501
01:38:55,399 --> 01:39:00,238
not one person I want to misquote but

2502
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:02,360
I'll ask him more about the the PPP and

2503
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:03,879
see if it has that relation because I

2504
01:39:02,359 --> 01:39:08,238
don't really know but I think that the

2505
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:09,840
pona ponia purple paralyzer was uh

2506
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:11,718
somehow related that Netherland purple

2507
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,760
IND if I remember correctly but don't

2508
01:39:11,719 --> 01:39:16,480
quot me 100 we'll see I really want to

2509
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:19,440
get Stacy on for a show he would be

2510
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:19,439
amazing amazing

2511
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:23,039
amazing

2512
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:29,599
all right anything else we wear out our

2513
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:34,159
welcome there's 250 here there was an

2514
01:39:29,599 --> 01:39:36,000
older question from LSD about uh I read

2515
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:38,039
it's R let me put it on the

2516
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
screen I've read it where for something

2517
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:43,719
to actually be 30 plus uh 30% plus THC

2518
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,520
and this is the biological threshold can

2519
01:39:43,719 --> 01:39:48,439
this number be changed in the plant I

2520
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:51,000
mean this has to do with like depend

2521
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:52,479
physical limitations right well itend

2522
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,158
depends on the parameters that you put

2523
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:55,039
on the thought experiment right is it

2524
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:57,000
fully

2525
01:39:55,039 --> 01:39:58,719
flowered that's the number one thing

2526
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,118
that I think because I remember that I

2527
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:01,279
saw that question when we were coming

2528
01:40:00,118 --> 01:40:03,679
through and I think there's a question

2529
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:07,000
that was like just after it too or maybe

2530
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:09,840
it was a different person maybe um but

2531
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,279
um anyway yeah I don't think there's

2532
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:15,719
like a real threshold for all

2533
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:18,599
circumstances you know what I mean but

2534
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:21,520
if you're talking about like 63 Day

2535
01:40:18,599 --> 01:40:25,400
stuff flowered exactly to 63 days

2536
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:27,880
I would put it like 30% plus or minus 3%

2537
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:30,238
you know what I mean and like a 10%

2538
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:32,118
margin of error is like pretty generous

2539
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:34,399
but that's like what I realistically

2540
01:40:32,118 --> 01:40:37,679
expect out of like a selected really

2541
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:40,319
banging modern cut that's um been

2542
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:42,679
selected for commercial production and

2543
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:44,559
also what's happening right now is the

2544
01:40:42,679 --> 01:40:46,920
testing labs are also getting a massive

2545
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:49,159
shake up in California specifically and

2546
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:51,679
so we're going to see a lot of numbers

2547
01:40:49,158 --> 01:40:54,118
drop right off the [ __ ] is what I'm

2548
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:56,639
expecting in January because we've had

2549
01:40:54,118 --> 01:40:58,880
to specifically go to labs and be like

2550
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:01,279
do not give us some [ __ ] [ __ ]

2551
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,480
numbers you know and so like when I'm

2552
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:07,198
submitting super large samples I'll see

2553
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:09,238
everything from 133% to 37% you know

2554
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:12,319
what I mean and so it's like well they

2555
01:41:09,238 --> 01:41:14,279
weren't lying on the 133% one you know

2556
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:17,039
what I mean or maybe that was actually

2557
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:19,319
8% so you never really know and so these

2558
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:22,359
really strict testing standards and the

2559
01:41:19,319 --> 01:41:24,198
state producing their own like um sample

2560
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:27,079
testing standards as far as like this

2561
01:41:24,198 --> 01:41:30,000
one milligram is one milligram of THC to

2562
01:41:27,079 --> 01:41:31,760
like run into an hlpc machine it's like

2563
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,039
gonna change the game as far as like

2564
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,320
what these labs are allowed to do to

2565
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:37,118
fudge the numbers too oh yeah I mean

2566
01:41:35,319 --> 01:41:41,679
realistically just look at it from any

2567
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:45,839
kind of like economical perspective am I

2568
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:50,079
too loud now no now you're fine okay um

2569
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:52,000
if you pay a place to give you tests and

2570
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:54,319
there's a bunch of places that do this

2571
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,000
testing and the people that want the

2572
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:59,759
highest number or the highest percent

2573
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,158
sells the best at each Collective

2574
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,320
they're going to be going to the lab

2575
01:42:01,158 --> 01:42:05,839
that gives them the highest percentage

2576
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:07,799
for these tests that is common sense and

2577
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:11,719
that's what's happened to me like it's

2578
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:13,199
just obvious um I had a different angle

2579
01:42:11,719 --> 01:42:15,198
into this which was thinking about it

2580
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:18,839
from the point of view of like physical

2581
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:21,598
constraints uh in terms of like canono

2582
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:25,599
balance uh from like the physiology

2583
01:42:21,599 --> 01:42:29,679
point of view any thoughts on that

2584
01:42:25,599 --> 01:42:31,119
like maybe loc or Dan can you ask it

2585
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:33,039
again I was reading some comments that

2586
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:35,960
are [ __ ] ignorant as [ __ ] I was

2587
01:42:33,039 --> 01:42:37,719
looking at this question about 30% plus

2588
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:39,480
THC from the point of view of like

2589
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:42,039
physiological constraints or physical

2590
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:43,079
constraints in the plant um what's the

2591
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:46,079
max

2592
01:42:43,079 --> 01:42:47,960
out you always find outliers in

2593
01:42:46,079 --> 01:42:50,800
populations for every single trait and

2594
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:53,880
so like what I think about it is um like

2595
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:56,360
say that an average my Skittles s1's

2596
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:58,199
have 2% turp expression there are

2597
01:42:56,359 --> 01:43:00,559
outliers that are three and a half

2598
01:42:58,198 --> 01:43:03,598
almost 4% in there and that's just an

2599
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:08,119
upregulated Gene that expresses more of

2600
01:43:03,599 --> 01:43:10,279
the exact same thing and so um it's it's

2601
01:43:08,118 --> 01:43:12,279
all preference that number doesn't mean

2602
01:43:10,279 --> 01:43:15,479
it's going to get you more High you know

2603
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:17,679
what I mean so that's what I hate about

2604
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:18,799
THC numbers the most is people get so

2605
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:20,520
caught up in like there's a

2606
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,599
physiological limit to how high it can

2607
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:26,760
be and I'm like no I think there's more

2608
01:43:22,599 --> 01:43:28,840
a physiological limit that um THC isn't

2609
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:30,079
the only thing that affects the high you

2610
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,319
know what I mean it's not even a limit

2611
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:34,158
it's just like a condition and so it's

2612
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:35,639
like if you have one out of the eight

2613
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:37,719
things that get you high and it's in

2614
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:39,520
this super upregulated environment where

2615
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:41,439
the plant's not producing any of these

2616
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,760
secondary cannabinoids and it can all go

2617
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:46,598
into THC if it's not producing any

2618
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:49,000
secondary Aroma compounds it can all all

2619
01:43:46,599 --> 01:43:51,119
that energy can go into just THC does

2620
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,599
that make better weed I gen genuinely

2621
01:43:51,118 --> 01:43:56,559
don't think so but I think it's more the

2622
01:43:53,599 --> 01:43:58,279
statement is faulty more than the

2623
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:00,320
premise you know what I mean what do you

2624
01:43:58,279 --> 01:44:02,079
think about this comment oh that's the

2625
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:06,079
one I'm talking about yeah I knew it was

2626
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:08,960
yeah 27% tops I guess there's a ma out

2627
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:11,880
same it's like chem 91 lays out most

2628
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,880
people but it'll test it 18 or less you

2629
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:16,719
know what I mean maybe 20% if you take

2630
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:18,960
it at the right time um but you know

2631
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:21,359
what I mean like it's not the thing the

2632
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,198
only thing that affects and modul Ates

2633
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:25,839
the high that you're feeling and Highs

2634
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,479
are differ for everyone and so like

2635
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:28,920
we've talked about this a million times

2636
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:31,319
where like some things give certain

2637
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:32,800
people absolute panic attacks and other

2638
01:44:31,319 --> 01:44:34,639
people are like that's what I smoke to

2639
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,159
chill the [ __ ] out at the end of the day

2640
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:38,359
and so brain chemistry I think is

2641
01:44:36,158 --> 01:44:40,799
honestly way more important than any of

2642
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:43,359
these numbers because like I met a dude

2643
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:45,880
at work who he can eat a thousand

2644
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:48,039
milligrams of Edibles and like be fully

2645
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:50,359
functioning and go to the bar and have

2646
01:44:48,039 --> 01:44:52,039
drinks it just doesn't affect him you

2647
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:53,399
know what I mean if I ate a th000 mil

2648
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:57,359
I'd be in the psych wart for three

2649
01:44:53,399 --> 01:45:01,559
[ __ ] days yeah right guaranteed bro

2650
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:05,799
like um yeah I mean I I work in that

2651
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:10,199
field like the QA stuff

2652
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:13,199
um there's a range for sure um the most

2653
01:45:10,198 --> 01:45:19,359
L see is like what 31

2654
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:19,359
32% you know um and that's rare

2655
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:25,359
um the quality of the weed though is

2656
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:27,039
like [ __ ] trash that's what I'm yeah

2657
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:29,319
that's kind of what I'm getting at too

2658
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:30,960
yeah I you know I bring it back to like

2659
01:45:29,319 --> 01:45:32,960
people always talk about like the

2660
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:34,520
Entourage effect oh it's this turp

2661
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,118
actually modulating that high that's why

2662
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:37,719
you're getting so [ __ ] high you know

2663
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:40,039
like gave be an eight percenter but that

2664
01:45:37,719 --> 01:45:41,840
turp is what's doing it I've had weed

2665
01:45:40,039 --> 01:45:44,840
like the the old Afghan Kush cut that

2666
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:48,159
was coming out of Michigan it had no

2667
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:50,279
scent no taste like nothing but it would

2668
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:52,799
[ __ ] you up and it wasn't super high

2669
01:45:50,279 --> 01:45:55,519
test testing in THC it was not super

2670
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,639
turpy that any that I could sense it was

2671
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:59,280
smelled like literally like nothing uh

2672
01:45:57,639 --> 01:46:00,800
another plant that I had like this uh

2673
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:04,079
that I got to smell similar was the

2674
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:06,920
Menthol and I didn't get to smoke that

2675
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:10,359
but this was a plant that for sure had

2676
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:14,158
really no defining scent it was very

2677
01:46:10,359 --> 01:46:17,000
much a like a blanket cardboard turp but

2678
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:19,638
it was it had such a great High I don't

2679
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,279
know how you explain that kind of high

2680
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:24,279
using the on Tage effect type Theory

2681
01:46:22,279 --> 01:46:27,319
other than maybe it's different canabo

2682
01:46:24,279 --> 01:46:28,719
that don't have certain smells or tastes

2683
01:46:27,319 --> 01:46:31,279
but a lot of people attribute it to just

2684
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:32,679
TPS or just flavonoids and I I don't

2685
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:34,479
even think that's just the answer

2686
01:46:32,679 --> 01:46:36,760
anymore I don't even think that we've

2687
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:39,039
identified all the psychoactive

2688
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:41,000
compounds that even compose you know

2689
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:43,599
what I mean like if we really think

2690
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,599
about cannabis it's like working off of

2691
01:46:43,599 --> 01:46:48,039
these like carbon ring structures and

2692
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:50,279
it'll produce if you look at tpin if you

2693
01:46:48,039 --> 01:46:52,560
look at canabo it's literally almost

2694
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:55,319
like like it's every single possible

2695
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:57,560
iteration of side chains off of this

2696
01:46:55,319 --> 01:46:59,039
five carbon ring kind of thing or I'm

2697
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,520
not I'm not a chemist so it's like I

2698
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:02,639
don't whatever whatever that is you know

2699
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:04,639
what I mean but if you can look at them

2700
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:06,159
all and look at a chart of all the

2701
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:08,239
chemical structures and you're like it

2702
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:10,439
seems like it's every single possible

2703
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:13,198
iteration you know what I mean and this

2704
01:47:10,439 --> 01:47:15,719
plant has this mechanism or like it's

2705
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:17,519
incentivized to produce every single

2706
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:19,639
possible secondary metabolite that it

2707
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,840
possibly can because we like it you know

2708
01:47:19,639 --> 01:47:24,279
what I mean yeah and so um I just you're

2709
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:26,840
saying that the possibility space is

2710
01:47:24,279 --> 01:47:29,840
like immense it's immense yeah and like

2711
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:31,679
Tarpin are literally just like one type

2712
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,039
of aromatic compound you know what I

2713
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:36,359
mean we've heard that on the show a

2714
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:38,560
couple times too where it's just like um

2715
01:47:36,359 --> 01:47:40,719
you know what I mean like it's just I

2716
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:43,239
don't think we have any understanding

2717
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:45,520
whatsoever about how this plant affects

2718
01:47:43,238 --> 01:47:47,319
our mind and our body's physiology I

2719
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,440
think that that level of understanding

2720
01:47:47,319 --> 01:47:51,279
is like literally we've scratched the

2721
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:54,279
surface and we're like like oh yeah yeah

2722
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:56,198
THC getss you high oh yeah yeah CBG is

2723
01:47:54,279 --> 01:47:59,639
for inflammation and I'm like if you

2724
01:47:56,198 --> 01:48:02,279
think about that that's like how a like

2725
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:05,840
Instagram influencer like Mom fluenc

2726
01:48:02,279 --> 01:48:08,238
type like talks about essential oils

2727
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:11,279
yes and like that [ __ ] is like the

2728
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:13,678
sketchiest level of yeah like sweet

2729
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:16,198
peach just said 400 different cannaboids

2730
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:18,560
we test for five to seven you know what

2731
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:21,960
I mean and nobody even looks at anything

2732
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,560
but THC and CBD like I have to go out of

2733
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:27,760
my way on a test to click more links to

2734
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:29,840
expand view to even see CBG or CBC

2735
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,440
that's wild you know what I mean and so

2736
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,079
and and those aren't even psychoactive

2737
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:35,479
so like I just think that like when

2738
01:48:33,079 --> 01:48:38,158
people get hung up on THC numbers I'm

2739
01:48:35,479 --> 01:48:40,359
like you've missed the the whole picture

2740
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:42,079
you know what I mean it's when and like

2741
01:48:40,359 --> 01:48:44,839
what local was saying is like when I see

2742
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:46,479
a 35% tester I don't think like I am

2743
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,719
going to get [ __ ] up when I smoke this

2744
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:50,359
I'm GNA be like yeah it's going to be

2745
01:48:47,719 --> 01:48:52,279
some kind of trashy smoke yep you know

2746
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:54,319
what I mean when I see something mid 20s

2747
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:56,840
with a high tur profile I'm like that's

2748
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:58,479
going to be tasty as [ __ ] you know and

2749
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,319
even then it's not always I've seen

2750
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:02,919
stuff with 4% turps that didn't really

2751
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:04,759
smell that good how often do you see

2752
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:08,440
thcv

2753
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:11,560
never my minute amounts constantly but

2754
01:49:08,439 --> 01:49:14,158
never above like a threshold of a tenth

2755
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:17,480
of a milligram to like a third of a

2756
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:20,920
milligram per gram sample um CBG is much

2757
01:49:17,479 --> 01:49:23,000
more common um that's the mo and CBC as

2758
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:27,239
well and just like CBC is kind of in

2759
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:30,920
between prevalence you know but um

2760
01:49:27,238 --> 01:49:33,919
it's do they even care about CBN anymore

2761
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:35,679
uh I don't I don't see CBN ever on tests

2762
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:37,520
it's like a category on there but it's

2763
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:39,480
almost always non- detect and the the

2764
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,360
lines that I work and so I have some

2765
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:43,638
stuff that I wish I could work at scale

2766
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:46,880
at my job but there's no commercial

2767
01:49:43,639 --> 01:49:48,960
value to it without like years of work

2768
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,520
and like thousands of seeds grown and

2769
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:54,239
popped like it's it would be the way to

2770
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,960
do that would be on a a sungrown farm

2771
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:57,678
like in a field you know because then I

2772
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:59,840
could pop 10,000 seeds and at the end of

2773
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:01,520
the day we're extracting it all but like

2774
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:04,000
I can pull out samples that I want

2775
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:06,520
tested and we can do something like a uh

2776
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,198
a mobile hplc and start getting like a

2777
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:10,560
quicker cheaper sample so we can

2778
01:50:08,198 --> 01:50:13,158
actually test 10,000 of them and not pay

2779
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:15,000
50 bucks a

2780
01:50:13,158 --> 01:50:16,759
sample here's an interesting one I've

2781
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,039
worked in cannaboid isolation and

2782
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:20,199
Discovery or cannaboid I don't even know

2783
01:50:18,039 --> 01:50:21,639
how to pronounce that still I think it

2784
01:50:20,198 --> 01:50:23,359
very unlikely that a psychoactive

2785
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:25,840
cannaboid exists that has such a low

2786
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:27,598
ec50 that we don't know about it well

2787
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:30,360
not that we don't know about it but that

2788
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:32,599
we don't test for it in any meaningful

2789
01:50:30,359 --> 01:50:34,519
way so it basically doesn't exist to

2790
01:50:32,599 --> 01:50:36,319
anyone that that would be working it

2791
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:38,239
anyway you know that's kind of more what

2792
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:40,679
I'm getting at is like there's an

2793
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:43,359
immense amount of canabo and we test for

2794
01:50:40,679 --> 01:50:46,239
five to seven you know and most of those

2795
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:48,559
show up in minute Trace Amounts in

2796
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:52,919
almost the whole working commercial

2797
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:54,360
population at Large and so there you go

2798
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:57,719
that's cool yeah that's kind of what

2799
01:50:54,359 --> 01:50:59,799
I've heard um uh I've also heard things

2800
01:50:57,719 --> 01:51:01,679
from like Chimera that like when he

2801
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:04,279
looks at lab tests he can tell when

2802
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,239
people are misinterpreting results for

2803
01:51:04,279 --> 01:51:08,279
cannabinoids and kind of like

2804
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:10,359
extenuating or uh you know what I mean

2805
01:51:08,279 --> 01:51:11,679
interpreting analysis wrong because they

2806
01:51:10,359 --> 01:51:14,839
can't tell the difference between

2807
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:17,000
certain canabo and so I just like don't

2808
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:19,119
trust Labs at the end of the day it's a

2809
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,279
marketing tool more than anything I

2810
01:51:19,118 --> 01:51:22,880
don't need to have a lab tell me if weed

2811
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:26,158
is good or not I'm going to smoke them

2812
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:28,400
all anyway yeah me see there was there

2813
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:29,679
was a let me see hold on here's here's

2814
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:30,920
the one they had that any of you had

2815
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:33,599
experience with cobbed or otherwise

2816
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:36,158
fermented and aged cannabis yeah I've

2817
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:38,400
[ __ ] not burped a turkey bag

2818
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:40,158
before I've had I've had ferment

2819
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:43,039
intentionally fermented hash that was

2820
01:51:40,158 --> 01:51:45,638
really good and from pit and then I got

2821
01:51:43,039 --> 01:51:50,039
to smoke cob at the last Gathering that

2822
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:52,920
we had and never done it makes nice big

2823
01:51:50,039 --> 01:51:56,319
dark clouds of smoke and that's about

2824
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:58,078
all I notic like it didn't make me any

2825
01:51:56,319 --> 01:52:00,319
more [ __ ] up it didn't make me

2826
01:51:58,078 --> 01:52:01,719
anything I frankly it didn't cut through

2827
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:04,158
the high of any of other [ __ ] that I was

2828
01:52:01,719 --> 01:52:07,158
smoking that night I can really smell in

2829
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:09,839
like gelato type stuff too when um

2830
01:52:07,158 --> 01:52:12,319
people don't dry and cure properly

2831
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:15,078
because it really does get this very

2832
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:17,679
specific I the the the people that used

2833
01:52:15,078 --> 01:52:19,960
to buy for me would call it pissy you

2834
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:22,279
know what I mean it's not really piss

2835
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:26,520
but it's this like I don't know it's

2836
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:28,639
this weird take on um it's a weird take

2837
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:31,079
on kind of gelato e turps and it's the

2838
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:33,920
fermented version and it's from the year

2839
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:35,719
that I did not burp not at least enough

2840
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,960
you know what I

2841
01:52:35,719 --> 01:52:40,920
mean oh someone just called themselves

2842
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:43,480

2843
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:47,239
