that's good you know things are I mean

42
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,280
event like what's funny is like a

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,539
million years ago when I first came to

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,098
California

45
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,079
um to see The Grateful Dead and Jerry

46
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:18,719
Garcia band

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,000
um I came out here in spring right yeah

48
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,039
and everything was Green

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,598
and coming from Illinois where I'm from

50
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,400
where it's flat as a pancake because of

51
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:27,419
the glacier it was I thought it was like

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,760
Ireland

53
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,339
yeah it was all like Rolling Hills and

54
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,199
and flowers and it was brutally cold

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,039
where I lived and it was a little nice

56
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,500
here

57
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,939
and I had no idea it got to like 110 and

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,739
everything died in summer

59
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,340
yeah

60
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,219
you know yeah oh I know oh I know here

61
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,500
it gets to be like 120 so well yeah you

62
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,439
you live in uh you live in the literal

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,598
frying pan yeah we live in hell yeah you

64
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,579
live in hell so

65
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,439
uh that's not my favorite part of

66
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,920
California what

67
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,959
I know I know dude I know you know I

68
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,259
mean I I appreciate the desert

69
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,739
but it's not it's not my spot we burst

70
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:13,259
Kevin McCarthy come on you you did you

71
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,980
know if you like flat and dry and very

72
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:20,519
very hot you know yeah warm nights and

73
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:23,579
good people good fun yeah indeed

74
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,680
so what what is our topic for tonight as

75
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,140
far as education goes as far as

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,360
education goes I thought we would chat

77
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,339
about a couple of things

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,180
um we would talk about maybe sort of

79
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,640
like the very late 90s early 2000s uh

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,400
period in the West Coast

81
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,219
and because there's a whole bunch of

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,099
stuff then that's pretty pertinent to

83
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,780
now yeah it was all kind of going on and

84
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:50,878
then I think we might talk about at some

85
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,938
point probably will fit in because it's

86
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,679
been uh a big topic amongst us this week

87
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:58,799
is a little bit of like authenticity

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,860
yeah and uh how to you know how to

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,219
address that yeah how do we address

90
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,780
authenticity in these uh times where

91
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,280
everybody's making money off something

92
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,780
being authentic

93
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,280
well yeah and people you know people

94
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,158
have their own their own motivations

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,918
their own wants needs and desires yeah

96
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,139
um you know that type of stuff and so

97
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,519
you know because

98
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,100
um

99
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,840
some cherry pie kush talk

100
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,580
cherry pie might be able to fit into

101
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,159
that a little late I've kind of avoided

102
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,439
the whole cookie thing yet yeah it's

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,560
probably a couple episodes on its own

104
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,300
and it's pretty complex so uh we

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,759
probably will chat about that at some

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,340
point but it needs uh that one needs

107
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,520
some fleshing out a bit yeah I would say

108
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,839
yeah yeah it's gonna be a deep one yeah

109
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,879
that's a deep one and there's a lot of

110
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,439
people making a lot of money off it and

111
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,418
there's a lot of rep on it so the more

112
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,040
money and rep you have it kind of ties

113
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:55,500
into the authenticity thing we were just

114
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,479
talking about yep uh you start talking

115
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,978
history and it interferes with anybody's

116
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:03,180
money or rep and all of a sudden they're

117
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:04,978
extremely upset yeah you know uh you

118
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,900
know I mean I made this I made this like

119
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:09,360
joking post I don't post much anymore on

120
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:11,698
IG but I made this joking post I saw

121
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,020
this cartoon and it was like I remember

122
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,300
it differently

123
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:18,538
in a way that fits my world view and

124
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,340
paints me in a positive light

125
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:22,379
that's for sure and you know relating to

126
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,159
weed history like you run into that a

127
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,300
lot

128
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,060
yeah

129
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,400
you know you you run into that a lot

130
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,439
you know so

131
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,418
um maybe we should uh I don't know what

132
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,120
do we we're getting up to 150-ish people

133
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:37,560
here yeah we like to [ __ ] for a

134
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,259
couple minutes and allow people to show

135
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,939
up yeah you know yeah and get to a

136
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:45,419
certain point before we start chatting

137
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:48,079
so here's one here's one just what is

138
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:50,579
the best blueberry not so dog

139
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,319
the best blueberry so this is another

140
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:55,439
one that when I tell you what I think

141
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:59,219
people will get upset at me yeah yeah

142
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,918
um because uh you know if you talk to uh

143
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,740
second generation genetics who is JD

144
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,359
who's DJ son or DJ they will say the

145
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,759
only legitimate place to get blueberry

146
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,360
is them yes

147
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,280
right yeah um but the you know for some

148
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,220
reason the blue bonnet seems to throw

149
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,038
these days at least uh some really

150
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,600
potent blueberry Terps and it's not mine

151
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,060
I didn't make it I don't get to get

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,819
credit for it but I did use it it's just

153
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,560
yeah to be transparent yes he did use it

154
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:33,600
so I mean there's actually a tie into

155
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,800
so I had my own blueberry line that I

156
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,300
created before

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,180
um during the times in Blue Bonnet was

158
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,699
being made and the Lone Star was kind of

159
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,620
competition to me at the time and I was

160
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,699
very egotistical about my blueberry of

161
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,220
course because everybody thinks they

162
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,560
have the best blueberry and I used it

163
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,360
and it did very true for blue traits and

164
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,160
very beautiful blue chirps and very

165
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,220
pretty but it didn't have much potency

166
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,780
for resin production to speak of and I

167
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,940
think Lone Star did it better than I did

168
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:03,538
I really do

169
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:06,060
so yeah what we're lucky is that it

170
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,439
still exists yes and you can still get

171
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,360
it from a number of different sources

172
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,899
yes

173
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,280
um ton so uh we're getting there I think

174
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,719
we're up to a decent time so we're going

175
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,418
to start

176
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,979
um and uh these talks have kind of been

177
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,899
we've we've been kind of moving forward

178
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:23,579
we started in the beginning in the 90s a

179
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,818
bit now we're starting to move forward

180
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:30,000
we actually still have like a third wave

181
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,500
of seed banks that Matt and I want to do

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,538
um that we never actually dealt with

183
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,699
that involves Canada and everything else

184
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:38,939
but it starts to get a little bit more

185
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,978
dispersed and difficult to get the the

186
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,439
accurate stuff so it's taken us kind of

187
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,939
a while yeah so yeah there's a lot to it

188
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,038
and and there's a lot to cover you don't

189
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,360
want to leave out a lot of stuff and you

190
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,740
don't want to forget a lot of stuff and

191
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,660
some stuff we do leave out and forget

192
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,400
and have to go back and tag because it

193
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,900
isn't that important so yeah and that's

194
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,279
kind of you know that's kind of one of

195
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,138
the things about these talks is they're

196
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,638
a bunch of History there's some there's

197
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,319
some speculation there's some

198
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,639
bullshitting

199
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,560
um they're trying to be conversational

200
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,120
and tell people about the memories that

201
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,620
people have

202
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,000
um they you know we'll talk about things

203
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,800
but they they get people bent under

204
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,360
shape already

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,098
um so rather than talking about like the

206
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,259
third wave of seed banks I thought we

207
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:18,839
could chat more about like like what was

208
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,180
happening on the west coast yeah which

209
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,859
is where Matt and I both live uh what

210
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,978
was happening on the west coast in that

211
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,020
era and how specifically California and

212
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:30,659
how that kind of like started to impact

213
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,639
what came after yeah

214
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,860
right so

215
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,038
just to let everybody know

216
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,219
um in 1996 in November they passed the

217
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,500
215 act uh the proposition 215 in

218
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,959
California and that made it was the

219
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,339
first state where you had Medical

220
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,838
yeah um now you know medical was uh uh

221
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,519
very restrictive at first and it was

222
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,860
only about four or five conditions that

223
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,419
it applied to and the cops had spent

224
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,339
their whole career just busting anyone

225
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:01,740
with weeds so they were also slow to

226
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,940
change yes because they saw weed and

227
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,278
they were like [ __ ] you it's weed and

228
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,580
we're asking you and so people think

229
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,580
that it like just became legal in 1997

230
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,180
uh it did not

231
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,320
um it started a slow process right

232
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,778
um and the arrow we're going to talk

233
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,240
about is sort of like the very beginning

234
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:22,919
of when gorilla started to end and that

235
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,080
process started to really take place

236
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,819
yeah you know there was the very

237
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,920
beginning of Medical in California so

238
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,580
things were starting to open up people

239
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,740
were starting to be less secretive

240
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,620
um and as we mentioned on shows before I

241
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,259
think it was 1999 that overgrowth

242
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,539
started and not that long after the

243
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,580
Cannabis world started I I don't know

244
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:47,219
the years on when they started

245
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,620
um so you know after a few years you had

246
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,440
this network of people

247
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,679
um that were connecting via these via

248
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,860
these you know these forums yeah

249
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:02,759
and chatting and stuff like that and so

250
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,560
one that ended up happening is uh you

251
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,480
know this this started a whole wave of

252
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,299
different things it started uh there was

253
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,920
you know really the forums were the

254
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:12,659
first time you could really ever trade

255
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,519
outside your circle that you knew in

256
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,860
person yeah

257
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,740
you know right

258
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,019
yeah I mean even even today I I still

259
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,759
see people uh you know in other states

260
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,259
where they say you know I can't get that

261
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,179
clone I live in this state and it kind

262
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,399
of blows my mind because back then even

263
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,559
like we didn't all live in like people

264
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,240
were getting Bubba clones from Ohio you

265
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,159
know that were in California you know

266
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,860
what I mean like if you didn't

267
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,600
necessarily go to the stake to get it

268
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,278
yeah and I mean you know one of the

269
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,320
things that's interesting about that is

270
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,019
that you know there's there's different

271
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,519
people uh for a lot of people

272
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,459
um we have a good buddy of ours that

273
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,519
lives back in the Midwest and you know

274
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,199
for him the forums and IG and Discord

275
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,480
and stuff like that was a way for him to

276
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,339
talk to other weed nerds yeah

277
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,560
right but for somebody like me who lives

278
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,260
in Mendo like everyone around me does

279
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,759
what I do yeah so there's no shortage of

280
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,620
hanging out like I'm surrounded by

281
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,620
people like me so there were some people

282
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,060
that like were you know really intent

283
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,639
upon getting on there and that was their

284
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,979
mode of communication yeah and some of

285
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,860
us just lived in places and stayed off

286
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,480
all that yeah you know so like when you

287
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,639
popped up or whatever it doesn't really

288
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,399
like correlate to like what you're up to

289
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:30,120
we all lived in the shadows yeah right

290
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,100
so tying into that I'm uh I'm probably

291
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,060
in my I don't know what it is I'm

292
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,040
probably in my mid-20s or so and I meet

293
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,979
this guy and I don't think it's weird to

294
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:45,000
say his name his name was Ron uh yeah no

295
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:48,180
right yeah yeah and uh uh Matt knows Ron

296
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,519
very well very well yeah and Ron was

297
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:53,338
Iran's a character and he's still around

298
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,000
and he did this thing where he started

299
00:11:53,339 --> 00:12:00,000
throwing these Harvest parties in fall

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,500
uh in in my area and he actually threw

301
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,578
him he'd run like a big ass [ __ ]

302
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,679
house in Sonoma County uh Healdsburg

303
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:09,778
outskirts areas like that like a big

304
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,759
mansion essentially yeah and he had like

305
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,958
a catering company and so this thing

306
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,278
would be you pay a certain amount of

307
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,419
money and this thing would be catered

308
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:20,939
and then all these heads would come

309
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:24,360
right yeah yeah and so it was the first

310
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,860
time for me uh that I really was around

311
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,720
like

312
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,000
um that kind of scene because most of

313
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,560
those people that were there like they

314
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,778
knew each other from overgrow or

315
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,399
cannabis world yeah there was like

316
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,078
groups that came with people like me and

317
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,339
stuff like that that like were from that

318
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,019
area as well

319
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,959
but there was a lot of people from all

320
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:46,440
over and and people are running who Ron

321

him with like the blue widow okay that

324
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,959

still working on like cocoa fiber then

408
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,300
that was so long ago cocoa fiber wasn't

bringing it to uh uh to America yeah he

412
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,620

planning on it right that's wild yeah

414
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,220
and so and so a lot of us that was that

415
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,040
was a lot of times where the where we

416
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,920
got to put faces to names yeah you know

417
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,299
like I didn't even know uh dirty I would

418
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,939

419
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:41,099

I don't know it so hit me up but it was

422
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,240
a but there was a bunch of people there

423
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,339
yeah and so like chip for instance who

424
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,278
started Royal gold

425
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,779
um he uh he had just come back one of

426
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,879
those years he had just come back from

427
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:59,299
Switzerland a tour in Switzerland right

428
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,379
uh because for people that don't know

429
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:03,240
Switzerland was like the first place in

430
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:06,599
Europe to really open up to cannabis

431
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,000
like outdoor and Greenhouse style

432
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,719
um and so when Amsterdam and Holland got

433
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,459
rough uh Shanti and and uh breeder Steve

434
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,058
and a number of different people shifted

435
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:20,160
over to Swiss yeah right and so Chip had

436
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:22,078
gone out and visited those guys

437
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,699
right and so he's got all these pictures

438
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,159
on his computer of like these

439
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,860
greenhouses full of Neville's Haze yeah

440
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,360
like 10 foot tall plants direct planted

441
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:34,019
in the ground

442
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:36,119
so it was just uh yeah Vic high it was

443
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:38,759
just really neat because it was a lot of

444
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,259
it was a lot of connected people it was

445
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,700
a lot of people that were active on the

446
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,779
forums

447
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:49,319
um it was five or six or seven years uh

448
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:51,298
before the reversal era yeah

449
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,279
so everything was everything was red

450
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:56,879
seeds yeah

451
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,918
everything there wasn't any NES I don't

452
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,200
even think I'd heard the term S1 outside

453
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,120
of a book

454
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,038
I don't think so I doubt so everything

455
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,479
yeah everything everything was hybrids

456
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,700
you know and people would bring their

457
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,279
hash bring their seeds bring their own

458
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,080
personal breedings and it was like a way

459
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,240
instead of mailing each other and giving

460
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:19,259
out addresses and DMS and all that it

461
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,120
was like a super swap meet right

462
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,259
and so it was really neat in that regard

463
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,959
because

464
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:27,000
for one thing uh Ron had a catering

465
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,120
business so part of the money that

466
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,298
everybody pitched in he hired his whole

467
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,739
team and you and he made two meals a day

468
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:37,139
for three days

469
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,240
that's wild that's cute oh yeah you got

470
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,160
to sit there and roll joints and smoke

471
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,660
and shoot the [ __ ] and pull tubes and

472
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,900
trade seeds and then you're [ __ ]

473
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,360
starving right and then like some like

474
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,340
tuna and crisps comes by the thing you

475
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,779
know and you're like I want some of that

476
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,918
and you're just so high and you just

477
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,440
start eating some of that and drinking

478
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,820
now you feel a million times better

479
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,679
um and so

480
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:01,319
the reason I bring that up is because

481
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,179
while now with a lot of these events and

482
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,939
a lot of these lives and a lot of a lot

483
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:08,640
of times like uh putting a face to a

484
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,279
name has become common yeah but back

485
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,679
then it was uncommon yeah very

486
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,599
so it was like really it was really it

487
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,200
was really like unusual and neat you

488
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:21,298
felt special yeah you know and I mean

489
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,000
there was uh you know there was times

490
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:26,460
where I mean I went I went there I think

491
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,019
yeah the foods were to die for old they

492
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,779
were really good they were fully catered

493
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,220
full-on meals they'd have snacks and

494
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,019
hors d'oeuvres that would be get brought

495
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,419
around finger food and stuff it was

496
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:38,160
pretty decadent yeah you know and then

497
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,900
just like anything else even if you're

498
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,720
an experienced smoker

499
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,179
you start smoking 8 10 15 kinds of weed

500
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,160
you don't normally smoke yeah and it's

501
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,000
the first time you're smoking all of

502
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,279
them

503
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,380
even weak or moderate weed will get you

504
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,678
pretty baked yeah eventually if you're

505
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,900
just pull in all day non-stop yeah you

506
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,519
get [ __ ] yeah and and so you know

507
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,340
there was different things where it was

508
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,679
like you can't hang out with everyone

509
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:06,538
yeah so you know you make friends some

510
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,780
friends I made there

511
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:12,658
um you know I kept up with really well

512
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,460
yeah others like CSI I didn't catch up

513
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:16,440
with again for a number of years after

514
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,079
those yes because you just you're in

515
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,419
different directions people you know all

516
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,000
that different types of stuff and um

517
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,679
you know uh Eddie let just it was kind

518
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,480
of just like a who's who

519
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,759
yeah and a lot of a lot of the times

520
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,159
those people Fletch people that weren't

521
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,859
very well known then yeah but now

522
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,419
they're all hella well known yeah you

523
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,399
know and they have some of the best seed

524
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:41,100
banks you know some of the best breeders

525
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,200
around some of the best collections of

526
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,879
weed around yeah

527
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,620
um you know when I went there I didn't

528
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,440
have most of the stuff that I have now

529
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:51,959
but I had I had the Maui and I had the

530
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,038
the chem 91 and the super skunk and I

531
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,200
had the super dog yeah um my uh my buddy

532
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,839
who doesn't like to be mentioned uh you

533
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,659
know uh from Staten Island he came a

534
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,099
couple years with us you know

535
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:06,419
um because we were still like right in

536
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,798
the middle of doing that super dog

537
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,919
project then

538
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,359
so yeah we had different phenos we had

539
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,280
the super skunk we had different things

540
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,759
we had hash that we had sifted from

541
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,339
things and all that so it was just a

542
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,679
really neat Gathering and time period

543
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:25,079
yeah people keep asking like what

544
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,360
happened but I think I think we did a

545
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,519
good job of recreating a little bit of

546
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,619
that just a few years ago

547
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,179
um a lot of people weren't invited you

548
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,099
know because it was smaller but I think

549
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,780
I think that there's still an ability

550
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,058
for our community to pull together like

551
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:40,798
that and have these big events where

552
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:41,879
people just get along chill and smoke

553
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,980
weed

554
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,200
um yeah so it was a privilege because I

555
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,599
wasn't around for for the wrong parties

556
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,580
at all but it was a privilege to be a

557
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,558
part of the the can Illuminati parties

558
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,839
those are it was [ __ ] insane to be a

559
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,839
fly on the wall at those events yeah I

560
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,839
mean they keep they do keep happening

561
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,519
um but I I will say that like they

562
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,158
probably won't happen like that quite

563
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,798
again no um just for the simple fact

564
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,280
that [ __ ] changes yeah you know uh

565
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:12,779
nobody knew who CSI was then nobody knew

566
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,879
who Fletcher was then

567
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,440
nobody who I was that you know I mean

568
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
there was people that were known

569
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,519
you know but a lot of them were we were

570
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,558
all in our 20s or whatever just trying

571
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:25,200
to figure out you know various aspects

572
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,000
of Life yeah you know and we were all

573
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,400
learning and trading from each other and

574
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,558
seeing what was up and it was uh you

575
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,140
know it was just days of and there also

576
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:36,899
wasn't a bunch of money or rep involved

577
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:40,320
yeah it was kind of like the last era

578
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:43,259
before that era started yeah it was so

579
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,259
we were all young innocent and dumb and

580
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:48,359
you know and all that kind of stuff but

581
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:51,419
less of a competitive nature maybe yeah

582
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,339
we were all I mean honestly I came home

583
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:56,280
with so many seeds from that event and I

584
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:58,619
gave away you know thousands of seats

585
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:02,099
yeah for free

586
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:05,399
yeah we just trade it yeah oh you've got

587
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:07,558
some Sweet Tooth by Blockhead from Steve

588
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,240
you know oh give me a hundred of those

589
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:11,099
and I'll give you 100 of this into this

590
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,440
into this and this okay cool you know

591
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:16,199
and it was like try it out

592
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,759
yeah it hadn't been monetized yet no one

593
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,558
really believed that you could make a

594
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,079
bunch of money in America selling seats

595
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,240
yeah I bet especially that era it wasn't

596
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,220
that it just didn't exist yet so it was

597
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,859
like all these heads each with their

598
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,019
everybody was happy this to like if you

599
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:33,259
could get people you respected to grow

600
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:35,819
your beans oh yeah that was everything

601
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:37,200
but man that was like you know and then

602
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:40,200
they hit you up and they were like dude

603
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,940
I found fire in your weed yeah now

604
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,580
you're like rocking around you feel all

605
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,940
good about yourself

606
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:52,019
you know good job and uh

607
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,000
you know and uh yeah in the Forum era uh

608
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:55,798
Caleb was white trash rednecker

609
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,140
inspector

610
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:00,480
now he's CSI

611
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,259
yeah who's terpogs I've never heard of

612
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,460
her

613
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:04,460
oh my gosh

614
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,179
we're gonna bounce around because all

615
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,178
those different things sort of interact

616
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:15,298
so just to kind of like put a

617
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,038
um you know Ron's parties were where a

618
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:18,480
lot of us made friendships with each

619
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,099
other

620
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,079
um where a lot of us met for the first

621
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:26,519
time it brought together different

622
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:29,158
disparate groups of uh weed heads yeah

623
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,839
all from their 20s through their 40s you

624
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,659
know 50s

625
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,579
um it went on for a number of years uh

626
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,320
it you know it happened in the in in the

627
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,178
Falls there was a lot of fire outdoor

628
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,918
and I should also mention

629
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,278
because this is pretty important to that

630
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,200
era where this is before the Urkel and

631
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:49,019
the and the purple craze really took off

632
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,659
yeah and so

633
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,519
um that's really important because all

634
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,100
good weeds still got grown and was sold

635
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,379
yeah there really hadn't been waves

636
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,959
where it was like get this one cut

637
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,000
yeah and this cut you can sell all of

638
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,440
that that hadn't really happened yet

639
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,839
um I I attribute a lot of that to

640
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,538
[ __ ] Jason King too for hyphen cops

641
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,819
up so [ __ ] hard that era I mean you

642
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:13,319
know it's it's it's hard I I don't

643
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:15,599
necessarily attribute it to him I

644
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,058
attribute it to the brokers

645
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:21,259
sure because I can't talk about other

646
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:23,759
areas but like in Mendo let's say 0405

647
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:25,558
if you wanted to have a 50 lighter and

648
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,900
you wanted to sell every gram of your

649
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:30,000
weed you grew yeah and you had

650
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,159
granddaddy purple or Urkel or something

651
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,579
along those armendo perps it all went

652
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:39,240
yeah if you had Sweet Tooth by Louie

653
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:40,319
maybe not yeah maybe not I mean you

654
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,419
probably could I'm not saying you

655
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,158
couldn't yeah but there wasn't buyers

656
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,679

amount of stuff yeah

672
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,299

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,159
Classics and things like that that would

674
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:28,259
go around vikai was still doing big

675
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,480
stuff Federation was still doing big at

676
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:32,038
that time uh people I can answer that

677
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,259
question someone just said where's Jason

678
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:35,759
King he's on Maui uh we'll we'll talk

679
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,200
about that in a minute

680
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,500
um because that was actually well that

681
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,480
that'll overlap but it really was it

682
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,460
really was like you know you hear about

683
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,140
the legendary Harvest festivals that

684
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,419
happened in Humboldt or Mendo small

685
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,640
little Gatherings and stuff

686
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,220
um that's really what it felt like to me

687
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,620
yeah it felt like being able to go to

688
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,259
one of those type of things and back

689
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:59,819
then you really just talk shop and weed

690
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:01,500
with your close group of hermit friends

691
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,079
yeah

692
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,640
so getting to getting to go to like and

693
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,918
hang out with dozens of different people

694
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,880
for three or four days and chat and chat

695
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,880
it up

696
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,740
uh really set the foundations and a lot

697
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,919
of the a lot of the friendships and

698
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,839
stuff uh for later yeah it really made a

699
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,520
big difference I think

700
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,619
um Frank you know friendships were

701
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,259
forged there transfers were made there

702
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:27,898
but you know ideas of things

703
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:29,339
yeah for a long for a large part of it

704
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,538
and I think like when you started coming

705
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,778
in heavy

706
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:35,879
like it was all a bunch of that stuff

707
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:37,380
yes yeah it was still very much around

708
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,539
like when I first started coming in

709
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,520
heavy I was looking for the blue widow

710
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:43,019
clone I was looking for the the sweet

711
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,519
thing clone I was looking for all that

712
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,139
[ __ ] yeah they were looking for all that

713
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,639
and that was like that was everywhere I

714
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,620
mean that was like what everybody had in

715
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,360
clones what they had in flour and hash

716
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,298
and seeds and all this different types

717
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,339
of stuff yeah you know Kyle was there

718
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,898
documenting it for High Times although I

719
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,058
don't think Ron let him actually made an

720
00:27:57,898 --> 00:28:01,798
article about it yeah because he wanted

721
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:04,200
to keep it like on the down low and not

722
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,480
[ __ ] it up you know yeah for sure

723
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,460
um but uh but you know it was

724
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,960
interesting and the reason why we're

725
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,340
gonna kind of Bounce Around to all this

726
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,179
different types of stuff is it all

727
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:17,038
overlaps yeah right so

728
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,200
um somebody asked about Jason King it's

729
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:23,579
probably a good time to chat about that

730
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,220
a little bit sure so at that time uh

731
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:29,639
there was this guy's name's Jason King

732
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:32,240
and he had this idea that I'm gonna take

733
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,740
a bunch of pictures of famous strains

734
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,778
and then I'm going to write my own Super

735
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,240
opinionated blurb about each one of

736
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:41,460
these things yeah and he called it the

737
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,558
Canon Bible and I don't think anybody

738
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,778
knew what he was doing at the time uh

739
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:47,579
would be would matter but what he did

740
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:50,278
which is super cool is he came out with

741
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:52,319
about three cannabibles yeah and they

742
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,740
sort of document this whole like late

743
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:59,700
90s through early to mid 2000s era

744
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:03,179
right before the Clone Wars where all

745
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,000
these specific clones of kush Urkel sour

746
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,679
all that started just dominating and a

747
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,960
lot of these random hybrids started to

748
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,580
be coming hard to find yeah

749
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,860
right

750
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:16,798
um so he came out with his Canna Bible

751
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:18,298
and I remember getting it and uh one of

752
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,099
the coolest things about the first Canna

753
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,599
Bible was that the entire first

754
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:25,319
introduction

755
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:29,879
uh is written by one of my weed Heroes

756
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:31,798
uh Rob Clark yes right and Rob did Rob

757
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,778
did this thing where he wrote this big

758
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:35,220
introduction into the Canna Bible which

759
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:37,980
honestly

760
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm not sure anyone could have done that

761
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,899
and given as much legitimacy to Jason

762
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,840
King

763
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:48,538
Ron Clark writing a big long seed

764
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,000
history in Clone history introduction

765
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:54,058
yeah because like I've said before Ron

766
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
wrote the Bible for seed breeding Rob

767
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,740
sorry Rob Rob Ron Rob Clark wrote the

768
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,798
Bible for seed breeding marijuana botany

769
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,419
he wrote hashish uh he's legendary he's

770
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:05,639
an encyclopedic knowledge he's

771
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:08,640
definitely like one of the Elders of the

772
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,559
whole marijuana thing yeah you know uh

773
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,778
he's made lasting contributions to

774
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,599
cannabis and so him writing that and

775
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,940
what he did is he outlined which strains

776
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:21,000
which was a huge debate even back then

777
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,179
yeah which screens went to Amsterdam as

778
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,359
clone onlys and which strains went to

779
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:29,880
Amsterdam as seedlines yeah and a

780
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,740
timeline of who gave what that was kind

781
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,320
of brief but who gave what over there

782
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,120
yeah and then a timeline of like all

783
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,158
these different seed companies and what

784
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,719
years they release different versions of

785
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,480
things yeah that was one of my favorite

786

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,159
follow the law come get me and so a lot

822
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:14,100
of people

823
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,880
um that uh a lot of people met there

824
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:19,798
yeah right and so I met Jason King uh

825
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,720
both there and I should should say at

826
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:26,038
some of those early Ron parties okay

827
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:29,100
yeah and we became good friends

828
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:30,720
right yeah uh through you know through

829
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:33,240
those connections through hanging out at

830
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,980
Ron's parties and then through

831
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,019
um you know he was he was a photographer

832
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,058
and trying to document weed and

833
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:40,859
everybody back then was fascinated that

834
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:42,599
Eddie Leck was willing to fill a field

835
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,979
full of cannabis and be like come get me

836
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:48,178
yeah yeah

837
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:51,298
you know uh and so you know and and and

838
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,798
so I decided to help Jason with his with

839
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:54,480
his project you

840
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:55,859
know he wanted to make a second can of

841
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,679
Bible

842
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:01,259
right and I'd lived in Mendo at that

843
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,960
point a number of years and Matt as

844
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:06,778
you're well aware uh weed was weed world

845
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,720
was still insulated then yes very much

846
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:11,038
going to get a bunch of pictures uh and

847
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,339
you're not gonna meet all the right

848
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,599
people without an in yeah yeah it's

849
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,099
still kind of that way for the old

850
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,599
school guys though you know what I mean

851
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:20,099
like but nothing like that guys were

852
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,079
hard to talk to but nothing like it was

853
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,759
yeah before you couldn't even find how

854
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,099
to contact an old guy at least now they

855
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:28,558
have like maybe an IG page or some some

856
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:30,599
way you can track them down that's true

857
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,639
when I first got into this I remember I

858
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:35,819
tried tracking down DJ's short to to

859
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,440
speak to him you know no dice you had to

860
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,240
find where he was going to be speaking

861
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,720
and see him in person if you wanted to

862
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,859
get a hold of him at that time

863
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,538
we'll bounce around just so everybody

864
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:47,158
knows I'm gonna talk about Eddie and

865
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:48,599
that and that whole era because that's

866
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,100
pretty cool but

867
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,658
um so these things will all overlap

868
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:54,359
because they're all going on basically

869
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:57,600
at the exact same time yeah Ron's

870
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,558
parties uh Eddie's scene at an upper

871
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,699
Lake

872
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:01,740
um the stuff that I haven't talked to

873
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,140
Canada Bible all this stuff is all like

874
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:08,159
happening and and is part of the same

875
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:10,440
flow same few years right so

876
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,240
um so I become friends with Jason and I

877
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,720
decide to

878
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:18,178
um help him with his project yeah right

879
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,858
um get him introductions to people let

880
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,760
him meet other people that can help him

881
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:25,679
kind of navigate through Humboldt Mendo

882
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,240
um and document and all that type of

883
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,820
stuff so

884
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,618
as a result of all that

885
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,359
um you know and I should say this is

886
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:35,639
that I I was pretty good friends with

887
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,619
Jason back then I haven't we've drifted

888
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,539
apart he's lived on Maui now for a long

889
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:41,519
time and I don't I don't go to Hawaii or

890
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:42,898
haven't since I had kids so we've kind

891
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:44,280
of drifted apart we're still on good

892
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:46,559
terms

893
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,260
um he's a super opinionated guy and he

894
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,878
used to drive some people nuts very true

895
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,320
very true like there are people that

896
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:53,878
will be like that guy drives me [ __ ]

897
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,180
nuts I always got along well with him

898
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,739
yeah right and on top of that I was very

899
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,259
sympathetic to what he was trying to do

900
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:03,779
yeah just another weedner trying to

901
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,400
[ __ ] put the pieces together yeah I I

902
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,220
strongly disagreed with them about

903
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,900
certain things oh you know yeah and all

904
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:12,539
that you know and we would battle about

905
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,920
you know all kinds of [ __ ] you know

906
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:16,440
um but that's not that's not any

907
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,240
different than today with people

908
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,679
um but he was documenting and there's a

909
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,838
lot of there's a lot of things in there

910
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,940
you know like you talk about like the

911
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,559
bull ride there's a lot of stuff yeah

912
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,800
that fell off the Wayside that's

913
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:31,858
documented yeah you know

914
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,140
um and uh and so I start helping him

915
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:37,858
figure out this different stuff

916
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:40,259
right uh and and you know and me and

917
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:41,699
Eddie and some other different folks

918
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,280
um started helping them put together the

919
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:46,139
candle Bible yeah right and by helping I

920
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,460
just mean making introductions and and

921
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:49,618
you know

922
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,358
can this dude with a camera come to your

923
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,980
scene yeah

924
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,199
because that's kind of crazy right you

925
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,500
got to have some trust yeah and I bring

926
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:02,039
a dude with a [ __ ] camera yeah to

927

your scene yeah you know uh and just so

928
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,320
people get an idea this is pretty funny

929
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,240
um I remember uh Jason got a 12

930
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,119
megapixel camera

931
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,559
yeah with a super nice lens on it to

932
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,720
start taking pictures because the first

933
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:18,480
can of Bible was all film right yeah

934
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:21,480
that 12 megapixel camera with a super

935
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,659
nice lens was over eleven thousand

936
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,480
dollars then oh my God I'm dead serious

937
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:30,838
dude over 11 000 because I was at his

938
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,300
house he actually rented this house from

939
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:35,219
Eddie Lepp that was in Lake County not

940
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,260
at Eddie lapse property but a separate

941
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:38,759
home yield yeah so I used to like I said

942
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,619
I lived 20 minutes in there for we were

943
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,339
so we were together all the time

944
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:46,619
and uh you know like like I said before

945
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:49,380
about rock about Ron's parties at the

946
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:53,579
time I was growing the super skunk

947
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:55,460
um the uh the the chemdog 91.

948
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:58,619
um

949
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:01,380
uh the black the black domino the snow

950
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:03,660
the Trinity a bunch of the Superdog

951
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,000
crosses and hybrids

952
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:08,219
um all that type of stuff and so

953
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,780
you know I start helping them get all

954
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:13,679
this stuff photographed

955
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,900
and and documented and you know and it

956
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,000
was pretty neat in that regard

957
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,460
um because

958
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,338
uh you know they um there's a lot of

959
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:26,099
stuff that was like that's been lost

960
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:27,960
yeah but there's a ton that's in those

961
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,519
books but there's video but there's

962
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,760
picture evidence and there's various

963
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,559
aspects right and uh

964
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,540
you know so

965
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,460
um if people are interested because of

966
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,139
that close relationship

967
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,000
um I had a bunch of stuff that ended up

968
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:45,059
in that book

969
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,460

971
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,280
my favorite strains completely organic

972
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:56,099

985
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,400
line basically a super skunk chem dog

986
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,700
line

987
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,980
um the purple effects yeah uh which is

988
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:36,838
uh Mendo perps crossed with FX which is

989
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,440
a cool story

990
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:39,358
um

991
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,940
and actually somebody said coral reef

992
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,380
that's not mine but uh our buddy Fletch

993
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,480
has been hunting for that for a super

994
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,820
long [ __ ] time yeah so if anybody

995
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,199
knows where the coral reef is uh hit us

996
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,500
up

997
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:55,078
but anyway like that that that

998
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,480
um that super dog thing is is the odd

999
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,700
connection that me and you have where I

1000
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,440
spent years and years and years trying

1001
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:04,139
to figure out who made the [ __ ] Super

1002
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,240
Dog by asking around the whole cam fam

1003
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:07,920
all that [ __ ] and at one point I

1004
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,539
couldn't get any [ __ ] answers like

1005
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,740
half half the people would say yes it's

1006
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,539
diesel it's the same thing it's just

1007
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:14,819
another day you know we made it yeah

1008
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:17,400
yeah yeah the internet to be that way

1009
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,579
but I remember before we met I remember

1010
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,220
in 2010 I made a super dog 2010 trying

1011
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,599
to recreate what I had read about in the

1012
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:26,639
Canon Bible because I could never

1013
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,320
[ __ ] find it and many many years

1014
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,639
later when we finally interacted I

1015
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,079
realized you were the source of the

1016
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:32,219
super dog and that was really

1017
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,440
interesting because it was such a big

1018
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:37,078
long Chase for me because of that book

1019
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,579
I I remember I mean I I don't really

1020
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,839
want to tell the story of how I lost it

1021
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:42,599
all but

1022
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,578
um I I remember like I mean I had it at

1023
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,980
all those Ron parties I passed it out

1024
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:49,740
freely to a bunch of people

1025
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,480
um I gave a bunch of Superdog hybrids uh

1026
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:53,578
to mandelbrot

1027
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,280
and it ended up being a lot of the basis

1028
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:58,079
of a lot of his males uh that he started

1029
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,440
using to get started because even back

1030
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,700
then everyone had to use pollen yeah uh

1031
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,960
not that everybody doesn't use pollen

1032
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,419
today but everybody had to use like

1033
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,460
males yeah like full regular males

1034
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,300
reversals were

1035
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,280
six seven eight years away yeah then

1036
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,839
um so I I didn't even we didn't even

1037
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,480
know it was the only reversals anyone

1038
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,299
ever heard of is accidental herbs yeah

1039
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,460
that was reversals and sometimes if

1040
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,420
people wanted to make accidental harms

1041
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,220
they would torture their plan

1042
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,358
rodalization

1043
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:31,919
they would make it dry out they would

1044
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,900
make it almost die they would [ __ ] with

1045
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,039
its life cycle they would just torture

1046
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,980
it and see

1047
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,759
can I get it to pop a bunch of pollen

1048
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,559
right yeah

1049
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,599
yeah like I I don't have like I lost the

1050
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,779
super dog I lost the purple effects but

1051
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,119
there's write-ups in that book of it

1052
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,619
right which is pretty neat because then

1053
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,720
there's there's at least pictures of it

1054
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,900
yeah that's how it got documented and

1055
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,459
why we we still know about it yeah and I

1056
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,519
should tell I should tell a funny story

1057
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,338
just because so uh Jason had this

1058
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:08,818
girlfriend named Rebecca back then and

1059
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:10,799
um he uh she was from North Carolina and

1060
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:12,300
they had this strain that is is

1061
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,318
semi-known right now called the

1062
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,480
Mothership

1063
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:16,800
yeah and it was this old ass weird

1064
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,780
sativa

1065
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,280
um and Jason just raved and raved and

1066
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,619
raved about it and so he got his

1067
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,980
girlfriend's friends to mail it to him

1068
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:27,838
in uh in Lake County yeah right so

1069
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,639
you're thinking today you know with all

1070
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,739
the mailing Tech that people have you're

1071
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:34,739
thinking some like small innocuous

1072
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:36,719
package or whatever yeah so this this

1073
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,719
[ __ ] thing shows up and it's a box

1074
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,399
that's about a foot a foot wide and a

1075
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:45,059
foot you know this and two feet deep

1076
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:48,300
right yeah it's a big [ __ ] box you

1077
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:50,818
know and we open it up and inside are

1078
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,680
two motherships with a bunch of with a

1079
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:55,679
bunch of stuffing around them in one

1080
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:58,739
gallon pots tied to steaks and they're

1081
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:01,259
like they're like 18 to 24 inches tall

1082
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:02,338
yeah so instead of the person mailing us

1083
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,400
cuts

1084
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:08,639
they mailed us like one gallon pots of

1085
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,260
dirt and 18 to 24 inch tall plants in

1086
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,759
that box that's all there was you opened

1087
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,420
the box and it's like two plants in

1088
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,480
there

1089
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,980
yeah that's wild but it was so unusual I

1090
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,199
think I don't think the post office was

1091
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,179
hip yet to like weed and like especially

1092
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,980
plants in the mail sending big ass

1093
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:24,179
plants in the mail no probably yeah and

1094
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,579
there's actually in that Canna Bible

1095
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:28,500
there's some uh there's some pictures of

1096
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:30,359
that Mothership because I was one of the

1097
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,619
first people that grew it

1098
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:32,699
um because I actually had running Grow

1099
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,140
rooms and there's pictures of the

1100
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:35,939
mothership at Eddie Lep's property

1101
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:38,159
there's pictures of the mothership for

1102
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,838
my greenhouses and stuff it was a really

1103
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,059
unusual plant but

1104
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,059
but yeah it got mailed to us in the most

1105
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,739
sketch way imaginable I remember in

1106
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:49,019
Canada Bible if I think it was the

1107
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:50,639
mothership that at one point Jason King

1108
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:52,500
was trying to say this has to be related

1109
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,539
to HP 13 because I've never tasted

1110
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,000
anything like this that was one of those

1111
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:59,579
extreme speculations that he was uh

1112
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,960
known for I mean I should say I mean

1113
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,060
he's my friend and everything like that

1114
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,740
but you read the descriptions of like

1115
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:07,500
the dog and the chem dog and different

1116
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:10,318
things yeah and I even wrote down like

1117
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,940
lineage in history for him and then when

1118
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,500
he went to do his artistic

1119
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,179
interpretation of what he wanted to

1120
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,599
write you read it and you're like oh

1121
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:20,399
that's [ __ ] yeah oh well oh well but

1122
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,140
that happens all the time people talk

1123
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,660
about all this journalist quoted me

1124
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:27,420
incorrectly or totally out of context or

1125
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:30,598
whatever else so but at least that's a

1126
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,800
documentation and it was there yeah you

1127
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,960
know

1128
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,099
um and well so one thing I'll say and

1129
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,199
then we'll move on and we'll talk a

1130
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:39,359
little bit about Eddie's situation right

1131
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:43,139
is that

1132
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,519
um so we did uh I'm gonna lose my train

1133
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:46,980
of thought but

1134
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:48,318
um Jason decided to do a can of Bible

1135
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,059
release party

1136
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:53,039
for the second candle Bible and he

1137
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:54,779
decided to invite everyone that

1138
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,059
contributed to the book

1139
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,680
with pictures right and everyone that

1140
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:00,659
helped him put together and who's who

1141
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,659
and um

1142
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:05,338
they uh and he rented out this very this

1143
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:06,598
very magical place which I don't know if

1144
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:08,338
most people have heard of there's this

1145
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,240
place called ore Springs in Mendocino

1146
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:13,679
County and it's a natural Hot Springs

1147
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,719
um and you know so it's got all these

1148
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,578
like cabins in the woods and stuff and

1149
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:20,399
all this beautiful Redwood and it's

1150
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:22,380
right next to the monkey huh no I said

1151
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,660
yes okay and it's it's right next to

1152
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,760
Montgomery Woods which has some of the

1153
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:28,559
tallest trees in the world

1154
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,140
right I think three out of the five

1155
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,059
tallest redwoods are all in Mendocino

1156
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:35,338
County right next to this this hot

1157
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:36,779
springs yeah so it's pretty magical

1158
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:39,420
place right

1159
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,920

[ __ ] head off yeah he can't even be

1229
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:18,420
put in that same category he made he'd

1230
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,980
stuck as an idiot yeah he was he I mean

1231
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,760

1242
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:51,059
five yeah it was only a few lines at a

1243
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,399
time that he would ever sell and they

1244
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:57,059
were just super expensive for for the

1245
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:01,800
time too yeah he had blueberry

and uh I have to say and he's still

1254
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,679
around and stuff and all that so he's

1255
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:27,299
gonna be kind of irritated at me but

1256
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,699
um it was my first experience with

1257
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,079
realizing that a lot of these old-time

1258
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,179
breeders

1259
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:37,440
don't know that much

1260
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:39,419
hmm yeah I mean I thought here I am this

1261
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,818
guy's this guy's been doing it 15 20

1262
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,318
years longer than me yeah you know he's

1263
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,818
made all these amazing strains

1264
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:46,619
everybody's getting all these amazing

1265
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:48,900
hybrids out of him and he's releasing

1266
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:51,240
all these inbred lines and who doesn't

1267
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,639
like the word Juicy Fruit tie or purple

1268
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,959
tie or yeah this or that so you're all

1269
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,578
[ __ ] pumped

1270
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,280
and then you start talking to him and

1271
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:02,760
he's vague as [ __ ]

1272
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:05,460
yeah it was yeah like super vague

1273
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,440
yeah he's um I think that is one thing

1274
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,199
that I have found with people that whose

1275
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,599
opinion I respect everybody that has met

1276
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:15,058
DJ Short including me has had the same

1277
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,680
experience except that he and with me he

1278
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:19,980
just told me I don't own my own company

1279
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:21,838
and that was oh you know he wasn't he

1280
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:23,818
wasn't he was open and he talked for a

1281
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,599
long time and we talked for hours over

1282
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:29,759
multiple days yes

1283
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:31,680
together he was super jovial and and

1284
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,720
conversational and all that so I don't

1285
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,219
want he wasn't it wasn't like we were

1286
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:38,098
talking about Hindi he wasn't a dick

1287
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,838
yeah yeah you know but but you know I

1288
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:41,579
kind of feel like having being a weed

1289
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,980
nerd myself and talking to tons of

1290
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,780
breeders yeah um if there's one thing

1291
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,940
you can do you can talk in detail about

1292
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,740
your own [ __ ] yeah you should be able to

1293
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,179
because it's your [ __ ] and it's like

1294
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:53,939
you're [ __ ] a weed nerd and you're

1295
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:55,679
[ __ ] into it and it's you know it's

1296
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,300
your passion and you know and you can

1297
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,919
just do that [ __ ] off a memory you don't

1298
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,780
need and he just kept saying stuff oh I

1299
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,700
have to go back and look at my notes

1300
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:05,519
yeah I'd have to check my notes and you

1301
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:07,980
know I'd ask him like why didn't you

1302
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,259
know did you ever did you ever back

1303
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:13,318
Cross or did you ever use any of your

1304
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,119
original genetics again yeah and he was

1305
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:16,558
like no you know he's like at the time

1306
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,940
he was like I still have thousands of

1307
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,140
seeds but they're so old and I haven't

1308
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,940
stored them well I don't know if they

1309
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:22,259
pop yeah

1310
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,780
right

1311
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:28,380
and so I just remember

1312
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:30,000
like walking away from there and uh just

1313
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:33,000
being like just I just thought I was

1314
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,280
gonna get a wealth of information yeah

1315
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,019
and in the hours and hours that I talk

1316
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,280
to him I don't I don't even know if I

1317
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:43,139
got too many tidbits yeah no

1318
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,940
you know and then if you read his book

1319
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:48,000
now it's gonna sound like I'm dissing

1320
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:51,420
him it is a very very rudimentary way of

1321
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,980
growing inside it is yeah definitely now

1322
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,659
the one thing I will say that I think is

1323
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,760
super cool about his book is he does

1324
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:58,920
describe a bunch of uh

1325
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,720
uh weed that he smoked when he was

1326
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,000
younger that's my favorite part of the

1327
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,939
book and then he also does this thing

1328
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,858
where he has this I mean we didn't no

1329
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,200
one used the word terpenes back then but

1330
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:13,619
he tried to make like an olfactory chart

1331
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:16,139
yeah like a smells chart and break down

1332
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:18,780
what smells are related to what yeah

1333
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,879
it's a really good chart and it was a

1334
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:23,099
fantastic chart I highly recommend it

1335
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,079
still because anything that trains you

1336
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,240
to speak about things in language is

1337
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,339
helpful yeah yeah so I mean he was

1338
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,500
talking about like squirrel cage fans

1339
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:33,779
and you know I mean that's kind of like

1340
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,960
you know he kind of grew in trailers in

1341
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,059
Oregon and uh

1342
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:41,220
use very 80s Tech and never really

1343
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:44,940
Advanced right

1344
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:46,739
um but be that as it may despite being

1345
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,920
very disappointed by talking to him

1346
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:53,039
about things I still bought like 400 450

1347
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,260
of the seats yeah every line he had the

1348
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,719
Velvet the Moonshine the blueberry the

1349
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:02,280
flow I bought you know I don't know yeah

1350
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:04,199
75 to 150 of them yeah right

1351
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,220
um and I and I I went home and I grew

1352
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:06,179
them all out

1353
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:07,679
yeah

1354
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:09,960
um I think is the name of the book is

1355
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,358
like cultivating exceptional cannabis or

1356
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,740
something like that yeah that's it right

1357
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:15,960
off the top of my head something like

1358
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:18,358
that it's got a really pretty flow plant

1359
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,699
or something on the cover yeah extremely

1360
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:21,719
purple I think it's a flow but some

1361
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:24,439
other people have said it's a blue

1362
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:27,118
satellite too like there's some some

1363
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,079
discrepancies on that as well well one

1364
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,500
of the things I mean when you

1365
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,339
interviewed uh Chimera and red yeah you

1366
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,539
know

1367
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:35,519
um you know one of the things that

1368
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:37,259
Chimera is good friends with DJ so he's

1369
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,000
not going to say anything rude but what

1370
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,440
he did say is he kind of basically

1371
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,380
admitted that he thought that everything

1372
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,539
that he had was like the same line yeah

1373
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,180
and it was just different Express like

1374
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:49,980
DJ would see an expression within the

1375
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:52,558
line and he would be like oh this is its

1376
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,659
own thing it's blue velvet yeah and if I

1377
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,099
just breed stuff with expressions like

1378
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:58,199
that it's its own thing

1379
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:00,900
but that's not really what was going on

1380
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:04,739
either because he was crossing opposite

1381
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:06,720
to to opposite when he was doing line

1382
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:09,000
breeding working directional which is

1383
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,399
what you don't do it was very artistic

1384
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,500
take on breeding for the time and he and

1385
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,539
and In fairness like we said before I

1386
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,760
they were writing the book as they were

1387
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:19,739
going you know like these were guys just

1388
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,780
getting into canberrating there was no

1389
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:24,118
books to be had you know at the time

1390
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,680
when DJ was doing this so mad props to

1391
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:28,079
him for [ __ ] doing what he did I I

1392
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,000
was able to uh

1393
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,640
work at the bunch of his work that I'm

1394
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,440
stoked on I'm not as stoked on his uh

1395
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,019
human work

1396
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,400
um as far as human breeding but other

1397
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:40,739
than that you know like as far as

1398
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,720
cannabis breeding I I owe a big debt of

1399
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:45,058
gratitude to him I mean I'm not but I

1400
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:48,299
just you know it's one of those like he

1401
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:50,099
that's the conundrum right is this you

1402
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,660
see all this amazing stuff you see how

1403
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:53,880
it all works you get it yourself and I

1404
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:57,318
grew out imagine people listening I grew

1405
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:00,300
out 450 seeds over the next year yeah

1406
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:02,759
and uh

1407
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:07,440
you know I'd like to say I found a few

1408
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:10,380
Keepers that I I miss yeah I did yeah I

1409
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,280
did I it it was unbelievably beautiful a

1410
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,900
lot of it

1411
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,059
especially pre-cookie there was

1412
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,059
lavenders there was Blues there was Pink

1413
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:20,640
There was purple there was various

1414
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:24,480
shades of in between it didn't have a

1415
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:26,219
lot of Terps uh and it didn't have a

1416
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,219
very potent High most of it yeah yeah

1417
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:32,639
for sure um but when I outcrossed it to

1418
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:34,799
different things I got way better weed

1419
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,539
yeah then anything of the pure lines I

1420
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,039
got from him so you can imagine how

1421
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:39,420
[ __ ] excited I am right because now

1422
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:42,119
there's no seed bank there's no

1423
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,460
middleman it's like I'm getting hand

1424
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:49,280
written manila envelopes from the guy

1425
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:49,280
yeah the real deal Holyfield

1426
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:55,858
am I gonna find the fire

1427
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:57,838
yeah here it comes right oh [ __ ]

1428
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:59,519
labeling backing everything up I mean

1429
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:00,900
you know how it goes when you're running

1430
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:04,380
hundreds of things and you want to keep

1431
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,900
track of it what the [ __ ] yep you know

1432
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,700
it's uh it's a huge pain in the ass yeah

1433
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,619
I just recently did that I mean people

1434
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:12,480
are talking about you know popping 450

1435
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:14,760
seeds in the in the chat not finding

1436
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:19,260
anything I just recently popped almost

1437
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,900
the same amount of uh stuff from from uh

1438
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,940
blue lines and uh went through all of it

1439
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,980
and had a very similar experience now I

1440
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,380
I I will say something because there is

1441
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,000
some there is like a an economic aspect

1442
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,858
that we don't talk about right where

1443
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,559
back then

1444
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:37,980
um you know most fire indoor was you

1445
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:42,359
know four to forty five hundred yeah a p

1446
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:44,639
yeah so it was really easy to grow flour

1447
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,440
and you have a side room or two with a

1448
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,500
couple of Lights in each for

1449
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,019
experimentation yeah you know the the

1450
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:54,059
rate you know a 12 lighter could was was

1451
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:57,358
everything you need in life if you

1452
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:59,099
wanted to be so uh the economics were

1453
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:01,858
really easy to allow people to

1454
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:03,480
experiment and [ __ ] around yeah now

1455
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,639
things are super tight and it's gotten

1456
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,318
quite hard in mathematics and economics

1457
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:10,139
are much more difficult right in this

1458
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:11,159
particular period of time yeah um but

1459
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:13,019
back then

1460
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,659
you know it was like that's what kept

1461
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:17,039
the cropping from being boring I got a

1462
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:18,298
question for you this is a good question

1463
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,279
this is from the chat but it's a good

1464
00:56:18,298 --> 00:56:22,139
question and relevant where did that

1465
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,880
Swami guy come from was he around when

1466

no no no no no no no

1469
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,280
that's weird see Swami

1470
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:37,099
I did not I mean he's a pretty

1471
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,798
recognizable character

1472
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:42,180
yeah you know yeah you wouldn't have

1473
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:43,380
even if you didn't become friends with

1474
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:46,078
them or whatever like you wouldn't have

1475
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,519
mistaken him no I don't think so no and

1476
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,720
you know we'll get we'll get to that I

1477
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:50,159
don't wanna I don't want to break it up

1478
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,838
but we'll get to that

1479
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,539
um when we talk about the authenticity

1480
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,920
part in a little bit here yeah sure

1481
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:57,659
um as as far as that goes because

1482
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,099
there's a bunch of people that one of

1483
00:56:57,659 --> 00:57:01,379
the things about cannabis I'll talk

1484
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:04,260
about super briefly is that you can just

1485
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,579
sort of step out of the Shadows yeah and

1486
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,980
then people are like I don't believe

1487
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:11,400
where this person came from if I'm I'm

1488
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:13,500
I'm who I am I would have known it yeah

1489
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,420
you know

1490
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,980
um so you know it's it's one of those

1491
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,780
things where uh

1492
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,920
there's a lot of shady characters in

1493
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,480
cannabis

1494
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,880
and there's a lot of and there's a lot

1495
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,740
of people who make good and bad opinions

1496
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,119
about people on the internet that you

1497
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:30,358
have never met and you don't hang out

1498
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:33,180
with in real life yeah you know Matt and

1499
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:35,539
I are friends in real life yeah yes you

1500
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:39,298
know like we're real life friends

1501
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:42,000
made real love to each other so you know

1502
00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:43,679
platonically from a distance you know

1503
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,358
all that

1504
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:46,858
um but you know it it's different and

1505
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,558
you have a bunch of people who become

1506
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:51,420
Fanboys or girls of different people and

1507
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:52,798
attack whoever they want to and stuff

1508
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,240
like that you know and it becomes

1509
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:56,099
difficult because they don't know their

1510
00:57:54,239 --> 00:58:00,179
enemy and they don't know their friend

1511
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:02,818
yes either they know like a a social

1512
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:06,118
media construct of that person sure

1513
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:08,219
which is not the same thing no so but

1514
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:10,260
we'll get to that in a bit so scrolling

1515
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:13,739
back you've got you've got Ron's parties

1516
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:16,319
right yeah uh being sort of a Nexus for

1517
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:18,118
this thing you've got uh you've got the

1518
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:21,539
can of Bible parties which were another

1519
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:23,760
Nexus bringing people together you know

1520
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,920
um yeah but I was I have to say I was

1521
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,940
super disappointed because I really feel

1522
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,880
like

1523
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:32,220
you know if you take home 450 seeds from

1524
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,838
four different lines from a breeder and

1525
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:35,759
uh you don't find anything you really

1526
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:39,058
think or want or want to keep you know

1527
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,920
yeah that's super disappointing yeah

1528
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:42,780
that it is disappointing that's a lot of

1529
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,159
money it's a lot it's a lot of money I

1530
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,900
mean he gave me a good deal don't get me

1531
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:48,000
wrong it's not like I paid full custody

1532
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,639
because I'm at the no he'd like to make

1533
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,159
money too but the the yeah but the the

1534
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:54,900
size of the room the amount of just

1535
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:56,399
everything that goes into the economics

1536
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,960
are growing it's a lot of money it's a

1537
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,880
lot of time

1538
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,440
and you know like I talked before it was

1539
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,280
like you know there's there's eight or

1540
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:07,500
ten American Elites of nl5 haze yeah I

1541
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,960
ran 60 70 you know five days and didn't

1542
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,960
find any of those Keepers yeah but other

1543
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,059
people did yeah you know

1544
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,760
um so DJ was a disappointment just in

1545
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:20,280
the sense that he comes from like a a

1546
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,859
different generation of weed nerd I

1547
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,859
think yeah where they're just not that

1548
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:27,659
deep into detail yeah you know I mean

1549
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:29,578
one thing you can say about Rob Clark or

1550
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:30,899
Sam Skunk Man is whether or not you want

1551
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:33,119
to believe a bunch of what they say or

1552
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,639
not they're heavy on detail

1553
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,680
yeah a lot of the old a lot of the old

1554
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:40,078
guys you talk to

1555
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,000
um you know they're light on detail yeah

1556
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,680
they don't remember or they try to make

1557
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,139
it they did it

1558
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,460
yeah but they just don't like it's even

1559
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:48,719
the same thing with like the sour

1560
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,280
stories or a lot of the stuff that

1561
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,439
happened in the 90s that we try to get

1562
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:55,019
to the bottom of yeah they didn't know

1563
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:57,059
it was going to be important

1564
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:59,159
I'm pretty sure DJ thought he was always

1565
00:59:57,059 --> 01:00:00,359
going to be important based on have you

1566
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:01,980
met him I'm pretty sure he always

1567
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:03,539
believed he was going to be yeah I mean

1568
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,338
like I said over that weekend I probably

1569
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:07,440
talked to him for five six hours seven

1570
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:09,838
hours yeah we were there for three days

1571
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,519
all we were doing was like literally

1572
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:13,920
smoking weed and hanging out and

1573
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:14,818
shooting the [ __ ] and eating food dude I

1574
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,380
would have loved to have had that

1575
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:19,019
opportunity with him I just it just

1576
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,900
seemed so not interested in discussing

1577
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:23,880
anything with me and it was it was it

1578
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,220
was hard because I I did look up to him

1579
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,380
so much and it's not that I lost respect

1580
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:32,039
for him but it's just like the more I

1581
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:35,099
learned about breeding uh Hands-On the

1582
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,779
more I learned about why his lines

1583
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:38,760
turned out the way they did and why I

1584
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:41,339
was having such a hard time working

1585
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,099
those lines you know um it all made

1586
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:46,380
sense in the end yeah I mean you know

1587
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:48,660
I'm not dissing him because like you're

1588
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,180
[ __ ] around the 70s or 80s or even in

1589
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:53,699
the 90s or whatever it's like you learn

1590
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:55,980
as you go you know you bottleneck

1591
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:57,179
something when it's early on and that's

1592
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:59,460
what you got

1593
01:00:57,179 --> 01:01:01,379
yeah you know I I'm not dissing him by

1594
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:03,298
any means because there's a lot like I

1595
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,619
said there's I think his lines are

1596
01:01:03,298 --> 01:01:05,719
overly inbred

1597
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:08,760
yeah

1598
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:11,578
but some of the most Fireweed at those

1599
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:14,099
Ron parties was outcrosses of blue of

1600
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:16,260
blue work yeah so there's nothing wrong

1601
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:18,599
with having an inbred kind of unique to

1602
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,880
the Cannabis scene line and it takes

1603
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:23,280
some outcrossing to really bring out its

1604
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,200
true character no that's kind of what

1605
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,760
what breeders would want something very

1606
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:28,558
stable and worked you know I don't think

1607
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,319
that's a disc necessary now of course

1608
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:34,019
how do I wish that DJ would have

1609
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:36,480
repopulated his juicy tie and his purple

1610
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:39,059
tie and his original lines every four or

1611
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,940
five years and kept fresh seed of the

1612
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:43,680
original things yeah sure of course I do

1613
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,940
do I wish he was interested in them and

1614
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:49,440
didn't just let them go to [ __ ] even

1615
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:51,119
though he had them yeah but yeah I do

1616
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,380
um but you know I mean everybody looks

1617
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,599
back on when they were younger and was

1618
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,579
like boy do I wish I did this yeah yeah

1619
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,980
I mean who doesn't have those regrets

1620
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,599
about their 20s yeah you know I don't

1621
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,579
even remember what happened in my 20s so

1622
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:06,000
right so that shit's [ __ ] up you know

1623
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:07,619
and so so that's happening

1624
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,239
um all these kind of Bible things are

1625
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:12,059
happening they're all getting documented

1626
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,199
in that regard and Eddie leps was

1627
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:15,000
another

1628
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:17,818
place that was kind of like Ron's

1629
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,980
parties or the Canon Bible parties where

1630
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:22,079
um people overlapped a bunch yeah

1631
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,940
because people wanted to come out and

1632
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,160
see this guy is growing a thousand

1633
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:30,240
pounds in his front yard

1634
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:33,358
yeah holy [ __ ] yeah he's a wild one now

1635
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,919
now it's like it sucks because you know

1636
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,078
uh what happened to him is he ended up

1637
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,659
going to jail for him and his wife ended

1638
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,940
up going to jail for 10 years yeah

1639
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:44,639
um and you see Gardens way bigger than

1640
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:46,200
his all over the place now yeah and he

1641
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,298
didn't do people should know this he

1642
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:50,338
didn't just go for it okay

1643
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:51,960
he did this crazy thing this is probably

1644
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:53,818
worth mentioning where

1645
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:57,480
the law said you were allowed to have

1646
01:02:53,818 --> 01:03:00,599
six plants and a ten by ten yeah so he

1647
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:04,740
mapped out his farm in 10 by 10 grids

1648
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:06,838
and he collected right

1649
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:10,139
um you know he collected medical cards

1650
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:12,779
for each grid yeah and each medical card

1651
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:15,420
was tied to a specific grid

1652
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:18,780
yeah and you could give him

1653
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:20,280
your strains to grow in that grid

1654
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,019
and he would do a certain amount of work

1655
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,280
like feed it and water it and this and

1656
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:25,679
that but like you could come out there

1657
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,839
and do your own daily thing and your own

1658
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:30,179
various aspect of different things like

1659
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,159
that you could put in more work yeah if

1660
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:33,719
you wanted to and really make your 10 by

1661
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:34,980
10 nice and then there was I don't need

1662
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:37,679
to get into that part of it but there

1663
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,780
was a split between him and you yeah you

1664
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,000
know so honestly it's like he didn't

1665
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:45,359
just like blow it up and go for it

1666
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,940
he literally had 10 by 10 plots with six

1667
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:49,500
plants per plot yeah tied to a medical

1668
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:51,358
card and he would just stack hundreds of

1669
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:54,358
them yeah he was just challenging the

1670
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:57,058
government to challenge their own like

1671
01:03:54,358 --> 01:03:59,038
little at gray areas of the law is what

1672
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:01,140
he was doing pretty punk rock I'm like

1673
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,900
yeah super punk rock super rebellious

1674
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:06,000
and he wanted to have Eddie LEP Gardens

1675
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,760
all up and down the [ __ ] the highway

1676
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,280
yeah he literally felt like most people

1677
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,200
wouldn't be able to grow their own but

1678
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,319
why couldn't you come bring your medical

1679
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:18,480
card to Eddie left's Collective yeah and

1680
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:20,159
grow your own fairly near your house

1681
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,519
where you could go tend to your plants

1682
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:26,219
on the weekend yeah you know and what

1683
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:27,599
happened to him was he he had this huge

1684
01:04:26,219 --> 01:04:29,159
plot in his front yard I'm not going to

1685
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,539
dig him out I got some posters from him

1686
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:33,239
but a bunch of pictures and stuff but

1687
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:35,700
it's too hard to show like on the thing

1688
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:39,058
um but anyway he

1689
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:40,798
and then the the last year he had he

1690
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:42,599
decided to get seven acres across

1691
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,940
Highway 20 from his house in Upper Lake

1692
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:47,338
and he was going to grow about 13 acres

1693
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:50,400
of cannabis

1694
01:04:47,338 --> 01:04:53,400
yeah dead serious 32 000 plants yeah

1695
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:56,280
that's a lot for the time yeah uh 32 000

1696
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:59,099
plants all documented

1697
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,900
right yeah all with all with and I

1698
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:03,059
begged him not to

1699
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,740
yeah because I was like dude I don't

1700
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:06,599
think the DEA I don't think I don't

1701
01:05:04,739 --> 01:05:08,639
think they'll let you get away with it

1702
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:10,019
yeah like I'm worried like they'll come

1703
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:11,759
down and they'll bring the hammer down

1704
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:13,440
you know

1705
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,240
um yeah some photos of that are in the

1706
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,740
can of Bible 100 there's a whole thing

1707
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:17,939
on Eddie in the can of Bible actually

1708
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:19,500
yeah

1709
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:21,059
um you know and and there's definitely

1710
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,400
pictures throughout the can of Bibles

1711
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:24,720
that are from Eddie's spot uh you

1712
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,240
probably won't recognize him if you

1713
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:27,899
hadn't been there but anyway

1714
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:29,818
um

1715
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,200
so I begged him not to do it uh some

1716
01:05:29,818 --> 01:05:32,699
other friends begged him not to do it

1717
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:33,960
but there was other people that thought

1718
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:36,598
he'd be fine and they were really

1719
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,880
pushing their boundaries yeah they were

1720
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:41,338
pushing it hard

1721
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,818
um and uh you know he got raided by the

1722
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:47,400
DEA it cost him a lot with 32 000 plants

1723
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:49,019
you know and he he him and his wife got

1724
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,818
10-year sentences

1725
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:53,159
yeah uh 10-year Federal Federal

1726
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:54,900
sentences and the [ __ ] the the shitty

1727
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:57,058
thing about Federal sentences is that

1728
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,559
you have to serve 85 percent of the time

1729
01:05:57,059 --> 01:06:01,019
it's not like the state where you can

1730
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,940
get off halfway for good behavior yeah

1731
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:04,500
and him and he was a Vietnam vet and him

1732
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:07,440
and his wife were older his wife passed

1733
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:10,798
away in prison sadly yeah um and then he

1734
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,880
got out and uh you know the world had

1735
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:14,038
changed

1736
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,019
he went from being this like Rebel

1737
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:17,700
Maverick kind of center of attention

1738
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:19,798
which to be honest he was kind of

1739
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:22,858
egotistical and yet you know he tried to

1740
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:24,480
form a cannabis church and yeah

1741
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:27,298
you know he's [ __ ] that's you know a

1742
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,920
lot a lot of characters right so yeah

1743
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:29,940
um but he got out and the world had

1744
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,220
changed now there's all these

1745
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:34,858
[ __ ] doing Gardens his size

1746
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:38,038
yeah and it's all fine

1747
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:40,798
and you know he gave up you know um he

1748
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:42,420
gave up a lot for that yeah he got

1749
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:44,639
hammered pretty [ __ ] hard and there's

1750
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,318
people there there's people that I I

1751
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,338
mean I'll mention a few people I guess

1752
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:49,798
you know

1753
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:52,139
um one of the one of the Skittles crew

1754
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:53,818
that like that spun off into Dying Breed

1755
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:56,279
and now is his own person Shiloh

1756
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:58,619
probably a bunch of people know

1757
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,859
um I I was like the second person in

1758
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:04,019
Mendo Shiloh met yeah um him in Dallas

1759
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:05,400
uh who's got another you know who he

1760
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:07,559
works with now

1761
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,298
um they both were working at Eddie's

1762
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:11,460
there was a bunch of people that became

1763
01:07:09,298 --> 01:07:14,099
kind of well known later that were kind

1764
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,240
of Eddie's Farm hands back then yeah you

1765
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:17,400
know and we're out because it was a big

1766
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,139
deal it was a big mess it wasn't the

1767
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,400
most organized character either so you

1768
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:23,098
can imagine

1769
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,780
you know he was definitely king of his

1770
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:27,119
Hill and he spent a ton of time

1771
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:29,220
entertaining and being himself

1772
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:32,099
you know yeah and then you're trying to

1773
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:36,000
grow thousands of pounds yeah

1774
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:37,619
you know uh and uh you know and but we

1775
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
were all young then a lot of us hadn't

1776
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:42,180
none of us really made our names

1777
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,858
anywhere you know it was all people that

1778
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:47,519

01:08:56,698 --> 01:09:00,778
face don't work the greatest yeah but

1816
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:02,158
his mind was still there even though

1817
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:04,380

1822
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:16,319
possibilities yep um you know it was it

1823
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:17,219
was kind of a it was kind of a smaller

1824
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,000
world

1825
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:23,939
yeah but it was all those bronze parties

1826
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,859
the can of Bible parties Eddie lepp's

1827
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:29,099
whole situation this was all sort of

1828
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:31,440
like a NorCal you know uh Emerald

1829
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,960
Triangle Lake County kind of thing that

1830
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,519
was going on where a lot of people were

1831
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,158
fine were starting to come off their

1832
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,859
Hills and and and meet people

1833
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,539
you know and it was pretty it was it was

1834
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:44,219
pretty integral to what came later I

1835
01:09:42,539 --> 01:09:47,039
think yeah

1836
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:48,719
yeah it was a lot of us that our our

1837
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:51,119
middle age now and are trying to pass

1838
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,880
down history we were looking up to

1839
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:57,300
people like Eddie Lepp or Rob Clark or

1840
01:09:53,880 --> 01:10:01,400
Tom Hill uh who is a cantankerous old

1841
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:05,400
man uh yeah

1842
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:07,439
yeah yeah I mean he was like I'd love to

1843
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:09,059
get him on here but we'll see well he

1844
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:11,819
was a little he was a little nicer in

1845
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,739
person but man uh if he didn't know you

1846
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:17,279
and you said something dumb on the

1847
01:10:13,738 --> 01:10:21,718
internet you know yeah he was gonna he

1848
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:24,420
was going to uh eviscerate yeah familiar

1849
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:26,219
at all your ego he would rip it out of

1850
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,500
your [ __ ] and make you feel like the

1851
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:30,179
smallest little [ __ ] in the world yeah

1852
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,738
people are saying there's very weather

1853
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:33,060
there's people saying oh I might have

1854
01:10:31,738 --> 01:10:34,019
met you back then not so it's very

1855
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:36,600
possible

1856
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:38,219
yeah you know that you met me

1857
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,260
um or I met you I mean there was a lot

1858
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:42,719
of comings and goings then even if those

1859
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,699
parties at Ron's parties like

1860
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,739
um it's not like I got to meet and like

1861
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:49,439
made lasting relationships with everyone

1862
01:10:46,738 --> 01:10:51,000
there yeah some of them were 20-minute

1863
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:52,799
conversations some of them were ours

1864
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,359
yeah some of them were in the tight

1865
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,860
circle of people I was hanging out with

1866
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:57,179
all weekend because that's how it worked

1867
01:10:55,859 --> 01:10:58,920
some of them were on the periphery I

1868
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:01,380
mean it's just kind of one of those

1869
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:04,679
things and none of us were none of us

1870
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:06,659
were anything man yeah we were all just

1871
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:09,480
a bunch of young weed nerds you know

1872
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:11,698
yeah Tom was like yeah I agree Darnell

1873
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:13,559
Tom was super nice to me

1874
01:11:11,698 --> 01:11:15,299
but you read some of the stuff when

1875
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,280
people ask them dumb questions online

1876
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:21,360
and holy [ __ ]

1877
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:23,039
yeah right yeah I mean he's he was

1878
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:25,198
highly intelligent some people don't

1879
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:26,579
suffer no Foods no he was highly

1880
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:30,238
intelligent and he didn't have a lot of

1881
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:33,059
patience yeah I I yeah I I can't I can

1882
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:34,979
definitely relate to that sometimes yeah

1883
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,739
I mean but you you see that you see that

1884
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:40,619
even now like you get so burnt out by

1885
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:42,718
dealing with people you know yeah um I

1886
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:43,800
think the same thing happened to Sam

1887
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,500
Skunk Man

1888
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,300
to some degree oh yeah yeah you know he

1889
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:50,100
was probably nicer and more chill and

1890
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:52,440
then you get you have to answer the same

1891
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,900
50 questions a billion times and you get

1892
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:57,299
accused of all this [ __ ] and all of a

1893
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:59,399
sudden you're a cantankerous old man

1894
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,840
yeah it's very easy to fall in that

1895
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:03,000
category

1896
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:07,619
you know but those guys were all legends

1897
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,600
all heroes to us Vic Tom Hill hempy you

1898
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:11,340
know uh these were all like leaders of

1899
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,579
the scene you know

1900
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:16,380
um and and Old-Timers to us yeah you

1901
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:19,140
know Tom's got to be I mean Tom's got to

1902
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:22,859
be 20 years older than me

1903
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:24,539
I I don't know or maybe maybe I don't

1904
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:27,299
maybe 50s

1905
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:28,738
you think he's only in his 50s yeah I

1906
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,239
think I think you're pretty old actually

1907
01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:33,299
I think you're probably older than him

1908
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:37,019
you're in your 60s yeah you know it's

1909
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:39,480
all the Oil of Olay yeah it keeps keeps

1910
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:41,340
me young or whatever but

1911
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:44,579
the reason why I'm babbling about all

1912
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,980
this [ __ ] is it's where a lot of people

1913
01:12:44,579 --> 01:12:49,920
because there was essentially like there

1914
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:51,959
was essentially like uh

1915
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,359
what's the best way to put it maybe the

1916
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:58,380
best way to put it is that in the 90s

1917
01:12:54,359 --> 01:13:00,899
most weed scenes were very isolated to

1918
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:03,239
themselves to very small circles it was

1919
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:05,519
very risky it was illegal everywhere no

1920
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:08,099
one was really chatting The Grateful

1921
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,320
Dead dead tour fish tour that kind of

1922
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,840
thing there was some overlapping things

1923
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,399
because people would meet and not be as

1924
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,319
scared because nobody knew where anybody

1925
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,779
else lived yeah

1926
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:22,859
no I'm not dude I'm 45. Matt's joking

1927
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:25,738
960. he's lying I'm 40 I'm 45 no I'm

1928
01:13:22,859 --> 01:13:26,639
definitely not 60. definitely not

1929
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:29,819
um

1930
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,500
you know but but you know I mean I'll

1931
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:33,779
say the same thing too because I just

1932
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,719
saw uh my buddy who I was talking to

1933

1935
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:44,100

1936
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:45,719
legendary people and strains and [ __ ]

1937

and I'm like just hoping to get hooked

1938
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:50,158
up you know and not to be a dick but

1939
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:51,539
like I felt like I had the chem dog and

1940
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:52,920
I had the super skunk and I had the

1941
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:55,560
Mendo I felt like I had the best weed

1942
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:57,119
there yeah I was like I had weed that

1943
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,500
tore people's head off

1944
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,559
yeah you know

1945
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,939
and and uh you know it's not to be

1946
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,440
bragging or anything like that because

1947
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,960
it was literally just the luck of the

1948
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:08,279
draw and the luck of my friends yeah

1949
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,859
you know

1950
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:12,960
um and uh and dead tour you know it was

1951
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:13,619
one of those things where

1952
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,840
um

1953
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:18,420
it was it was sort of like a huge weed

1954
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,640
Emporium yeah and it made a lot of these

1955
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,899
connections and it made a lot of these

1956
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,719
things that I tied in and the whole

1957
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:26,698
reason I came out to Mendocino County

1958
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,760
um was because I had a buddy who lived

1959
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:31,859
in Ukiah which is in the heart of Mendo

1960
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,239
um who after 215 passed was like dude

1961
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:35,579
get the [ __ ] out here why are you living

1962
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:37,079
in Chicago yeah so it was literally

1963
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:38,640
connections from dead tour that like

1964
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:41,819
brought me out here right

1965
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,659
so getting back to what I was saying is

1966
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:45,899
that

1967
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:48,179
in Northern California and in Dead shows

1968
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:50,519
there was a weed scene

1969
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:52,980
and on the forums it developed a weed

1970
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,860
scene and in the Emerald Triangle there

1971
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:58,079
was kind of a weed scene right and then

1972
01:14:55,859 --> 01:15:00,839
these parties and these events and stuff

1973
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,880
was sort of like the first mixers

1974
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:05,819
yeah they were the first places where

1975
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,100
these scenes started to like overlap

1976
01:15:05,819 --> 01:15:09,479
or the Forum scene and the Mendo and

1977
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,920
Humboldt scenes and the Grateful Dead

1978
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:12,779
scenes and all these different groups

1979
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,880
that have ties to different circles they

1980
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:16,259
start like a Venn diagram the circles

1981
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,539
start Crossing

1982
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:20,460
yeah and I honestly think that's set up

1983
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:21,539
kind of everything for the American we'd

1984
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:24,119
seen for later

1985
01:15:21,539 --> 01:15:26,939
I think so I really do like none of us

1986
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:28,319
knew it at the time no by any means it

1987
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,779
wasn't like we're like oh we're here for

1988
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:33,059
history you know it was just it but it

1989
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:34,979
did it was it was the merging of things

1990
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,020
I mean I should say even back then this

1991
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:40,198
was a few years after Ron's parties but

1992
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:42,540
like um you know I mentioned the purple

1993
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:43,859
effects that's in the uh that's in the

1994
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:45,539
Canna Bible

1995
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:46,679
maybe I should talk about that for a

1996
01:15:45,539 --> 01:15:48,420
second because people might be

1997
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:50,279
interested in that

1998
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:52,679
um the purple the purple part of purple

1999
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:56,279
effects is just Mendo perks right yes

2000
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:59,819
and the effects was this old garlic bud

2001
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:03,479
strain that I got from uh the head

2002
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:05,279
grower who worked for Tim Blake yeah now

2003
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:07,619
Tim Blake now is very famous because

2004
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:10,259
he's the founder of emerald cup

2005
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:14,039
but back then he was just a big uh

2006
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:16,679
gorilla outdoor indoor uh farmer yeah

2007
01:16:14,039 --> 01:16:18,840
and his his main worker was about my age

2008
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:20,640
they are the purple effects and they

2009
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:24,480
gave me the effects which was a super

2010
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:27,840
golden gorgeous Frosty turkey thing

2011
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:29,698
right yeah and uh you know there wasn't

2012
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,980
any reversals but how the the purple

2013
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:35,698
effects got made

2014
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:37,079
um in the Canon Bible is that I had a

2015
01:16:35,698 --> 01:16:38,519
system that got a little stressed

2016
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:40,079
because I had an air conditioner issue

2017
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,560
and it took me a few days to get it

2018
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:45,420
fixed and you know as as CSI will tell

2019
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,719
you you stress the Mendo perps and the

2020
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:50,880
[ __ ] it'll harm yeah right so the

2021
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:52,619
Mendo perfs hermed all over the effects

2022
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,539
that was right next to it

2023
01:16:52,619 --> 01:16:58,198
and me and a buddy got about a thousand

2024
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:59,880
seats Jesus 800 to a thousand I mean at

2025
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:01,799
the time we were hella pissed and the

2026
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:04,319
reason why we got that many was because

2027
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,360
we had like these six or seven you know

2028
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:09,299
quarter pound uh six ounce you know

2029
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:11,579
effects plants all around it that we

2030
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:13,380
couldn't sell yeah they're a truck full

2031
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:15,779
of [ __ ] seed

2032
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:18,300
but we cracked this thing and it ends up

2033
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:20,759
being super terpy

2034
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:23,400
um you know and all that and it ended up

2035
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:25,140
in the Canon Bible it was gorgeous weed

2036
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:26,759
um and you know I should say that

2037
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,100
there's been some battles amongst the

2038
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,199
crew we'll talk about that too but

2039
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,820
um some of that weed exists still I

2040
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:34,259
don't have it I lost it in a bus but

2041
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:35,460
some of that weed exist still and it's

2042
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:37,140
in

2043
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:40,020
um it's in the Rose

2044
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:42,360
it's in the Sprite

2045
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,760
um it got passed around at some of Tim

2046
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:46,619
Blake's early and you know people should

2047
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,020
know that Tim Blake had this spot called

2048
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:51,119
area 101 in uh north of Laytonville

2049
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:53,940
right yeah and he threw a bunch of weed

2050
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:56,698
events up there and he threw um a bunch

2051
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:57,899
of like essentially like weird Raves and

2052
01:17:56,698 --> 01:17:59,879
different kinds of like musical

2053
01:17:57,899 --> 01:18:01,460
Gatherings and and all that kind of

2054
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,140
stuff and it was kind of like a scene

2055
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:05,698
and you know the first half a dozen

2056
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:09,179
Emerald cups

2057
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:10,799
we're all super local events held there

2058
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:12,239
yeah

2059
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,619
um and so I passed out a bunch of seed

2060
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:15,059
there was a gentleman that used to work

2061
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:17,039
up there and used to work at reggae a

2062
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:18,480
bunch called fuzzy

2063
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:21,359
um that's not his real name but that's

2064
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:23,339
his nickname and uh

2065
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,259
you know and all that and stuff and so

2066
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:27,539
you know he ended up getting the purple

2067
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:29,820
effects from me and and that's who the

2068
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:32,039
you know Tony Mendo and those guys got

2069
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:33,899
it from yeah and it got blended into

2070
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:35,158
Skittles and it got got all these

2071
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:36,658
different things you know and it it

2072
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:39,479
lives today

2073
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:41,460
yeah you know uh no but that was a total

2074
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:44,939
that was before Femmes that was

2075
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:46,859
literally an unintentional [ __ ] up uh

2076
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:50,039
where in summertime the AC went out for

2077
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:51,299
two days yeah and you know got hot and

2078
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:53,579
then I put a new AC in and everything

2079
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:57,000
was good and then the Mendo P just threw

2080
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:58,979
through pollen yeah and I had and I had

2081
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,060
a feminized cross

2082
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:02,459
um people are asking what about

2083
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:04,620
California black rose as far as I know

2084
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:07,319
it's the same thing same thing um so

2085
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:11,039
what happened to them is like a lot of

2086
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:13,679
cannabis terms uh Rose is trademarked

2087
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:16,619
yeah Rose is a very specific kind of

2088
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,940
wine and there's also another seed

2089
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:20,399
company that has a totally different

2090
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:22,259
line called Rose as well Relentless and

2091
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,939
that's not related to I don't think it's

2092
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:25,260
related to the same time Greek one but

2093
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:26,719
yeah don't quote me now that I think of

2094
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,640
that I don't know

2095
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,279
so they had to change it uh because they

2096
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,659
got because as you get legal and you

2097
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:35,880
start entering these things and stuff

2098
01:19:33,658 --> 01:19:38,099

cookies because they got [ __ ] sued by

2101
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,819
the Girl Scouts yeah you know the reason

2102
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:46,920
why Skittles has Z's

2103
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:49,019
yeah you know as they're trying to skate

2104
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,579
around these these trademark laws right

2105
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:53,340
so

2106
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:56,880
Rose is Russian OG

2107
01:19:53,340 --> 01:20:00,239
crossed with Skittles that's the Z

2108
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,460
cross the purple effects that's the e

2109
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:03,959
and it took second place I don't know

2110
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:06,060
three four years ago or whatever at the

2111
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:08,639
Emerald Coast so what I got out of them

2112
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:10,800
and and this this one's been I think I

2113
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:14,100
have a screenshot of it it was Russian

2114
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:16,139
Kush Oz Kush effects crossed back to

2115
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,480
Skittles is the claim yeah something

2116
01:20:16,139 --> 01:20:20,219
like yeah yeah so it's close to yeah but

2117
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:22,678
they had the the seeds that they had

2118
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:25,020
were purple effect seeds from from fuzzy

2119
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:27,779
that was from me yeah because back then

2120
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,760
it was like there wasn't any I mean in

2121
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:32,279
the same time frame

2122
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:36,060
um I should say this too but you know uh

2123
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:38,579
my buddy from uh me and and uh uh skunk

2124
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:40,260
vie's old friend who um with the chems

2125
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:42,719
and stuff we were working on these super

2126
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:44,520
dog projects together and Crossing them

2127
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,158
to all kinds of different hybrids and

2128
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:49,920
and clone only as we had

2129
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:51,779
um and my buddy manual brought uh at the

2130
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,819
time who wasn't into seeds or breeding

2131
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:55,559
wanted to get started with weed and I

2132
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:58,259
ended up giving him a bunch of seeds and

2133
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,760
some clones to get them started on this

2134
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:01,380
project and he ended up becoming pretty

2135
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,940
well known

2136
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:04,920
um some of the stuff he got famous for

2137
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:06,119
was based off that work some of it was a

2138
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,840
little different from different things

2139
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:12,599
yeah um but the the reason I brought

2140
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,520
that up isn't to like lay claim it's to

2141
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,699
say that back then we were very free

2142
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,960
with trading things yeah because no one

2143
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:22,460
ever thought that they could come out of

2144
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,460
the woodwork and lay claim to anything

2145
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:27,000
yeah

2146
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:29,698
it's all like [ __ ] you you can't breed

2147
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,738
with my my cut that's mine that's my

2148
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:33,419
seed line I want Matt knows this more

2149
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:35,158
than me because

2150
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,960
um I I've avoided so far a lot of the

2151
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:39,719
weed politics by giving away a bunch of

2152
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:42,840
seeds for free yeah and when you sell

2153
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:45,000
seeds like Matt uh you end up getting

2154
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:47,819
you know I want half the seeds because

2155
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,520
you use my cut in this one cross I want

2156
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:53,039
rep I want you to mention me I want you

2157
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,380
to give me money uh it's my [ __ ] you

2158
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:56,760
don't have permission

2159
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:59,159
so many [ __ ] I've had to give just

2160
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:01,199
because of seats it's not fair not fair

2161
01:21:59,158 --> 01:22:03,359
yeah it's not you know I mean do what

2162
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,399
you love do what you love so it's what

2163
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:06,960
I'm good at so yeah yeah I mean so there

2164
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:09,779
you know there's an aspect of politics

2165
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,420
but this was before that politics

2166
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:14,880
yeah people just swap seeds people just

2167
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,800
swapped you know people just swapped

2168
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,900
cuttings people swapped you know all

2169
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,520
this different stuff it wasn't like you

2170
01:22:18,899 --> 01:22:23,039
know you didn't want your name attached

2171
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,620
to weed yeah because then they'd [ __ ]

2172
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:28,139
find you what the [ __ ] is that yeah it's

2173
01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:29,880
ridiculous you know you'd be you you'd

2174
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:32,340
get you getting [ __ ] you get you get

2175
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,020
in trouble yeah right you don't want

2176
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:36,659
anything named after you what the [ __ ]

2177
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:38,880
is crazy you know yeah and then and now

2178
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:41,039
it now it's come full circle it's 180

2179
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,719
degrees and now it's like someone's like

2180
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,880
I didn't breed this cut but I did make

2181
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:47,158
it famous so therefore if you're making

2182
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:50,340
any money off it you must give me money

2183
01:22:47,158 --> 01:22:53,460
the role of the mac and it's in yeah and

2184
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:55,679
it's it's in my terms yeah yeah you know

2185
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:58,198
I want seeds I want money I want rep I

2186
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:00,840
want all three and all this different

2187
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:02,759
stuff but it's just like those things I

2188
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,440
mean it's even like you know people were

2189
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:07,260
asking way earlier on the thing that I

2190
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:10,439
have to sign a disclosure for DJ

2191
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:12,060
yeah DJ came up with all that all that

2192
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:15,059
this is my [ __ ] you can't do anything

2193
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:17,580
with it way [ __ ] later yeah yeah at

2194
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:19,620
that time there was no at the time there

2195
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:22,859
was no I mean people should give credit

2196
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:24,119
you know I mean I just saw a homie

2197
01:23:22,859 --> 01:23:26,819
mention that people should give credit

2198
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:29,698
you should say that I got this from this

2199
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:32,219
person you know you also should

2200
01:23:29,698 --> 01:23:33,539
um if you got a cut from somebody

2201
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:35,639
um you should give it back to them if

2202
01:23:33,539 --> 01:23:37,079
they lose it yeah it's really good

2203
01:23:35,639 --> 01:23:38,880
etiquette you know

2204
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:41,219
um I've had multiple things that I've

2205
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,500
lost and I've tried to get back from

2206
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:45,300
people I I mentioned the purple effects

2207
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:47,158
that's one of them it exists I can't get

2208
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:50,460
it back without trading other things for

2209
01:23:47,158 --> 01:23:52,679
it yeah which I think is uh super shady

2210
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:55,560
and a breach of the code

2211
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:57,840
at least the code when I came up

2212
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,460
um you're definitely supposed to do that

2213
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,319
there's some honor I mean half the

2214
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,819
reason people trade things is so you

2215
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:05,519
don't lose things

2216
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:08,519
yeah because angry girlfriend angry

2217
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:11,699
boyfriend bust fire landlord moving

2218
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:14,219
accident whatever you know yeah all

2219
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:14,879
those different types of things

2220
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:16,920
um

2221
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:19,020
you know you you trade things back

2222
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,520
amongst people you know yeah I mean one

2223
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,900
of the reasons you know I'll say this

2224
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,940
because he's because he's listening or

2225
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:26,579
whatever but I mean one of the reasons

2226
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:28,919
why the chem 91 didn't get lost

2227
01:24:26,579 --> 01:24:31,760
yeah was because there was a tight group

2228
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:34,920
of uh you know four or five of us myself

2229
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:36,780
uh skunk VA I see Collective my buddy

2230
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,579
from Staten Island who all had it and

2231
01:24:36,779 --> 01:24:42,238
all lived in NorCal

2232
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:44,219
and you know we all kept it alive

2233
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:45,658
you know people sometimes people got in

2234
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:47,100
trouble some people had to move

2235
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:49,500
sometimes you had to get back from

2236
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:52,380
somebody or whatever and it was like we

2237
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:54,479
were all heavily invested in making sure

2238
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:57,119
these things lived

2239
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,619
you know yeah I mean that's that's why a

2240
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:00,179
lot of these cuts are still in our group

2241
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:03,359
you know like in our tight Circle

2242
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:05,699
because you know we all move around we

2243
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:07,559

just saying I'll just say I'll just say

2245
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:11,219
this uh and I I gotta keep thinking

2246
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,100
because I keep wanting to say his name

2247
01:25:11,219 --> 01:25:15,899

01:28:42,779 --> 01:28:46,738
end at the end of the day than the money

2355
01:29:02,819 --> 01:29:06,960
weed nerds in some way or whatever you

2356
01:29:04,738 --> 01:29:09,000
know and like you it's odd you know

2357
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,939
living alone or living by your you know

2358
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,819
living amongst uh you know small groups

2359
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:16,979
of people and living weed and taking a

2360
01:29:14,819 --> 01:29:19,139
bunch of risks and staying secret for a

2361
01:29:16,979 --> 01:29:20,459
long time like me showing my face is

2362
01:29:19,139 --> 01:29:23,579
[ __ ] nuts

2363
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:24,899
yeah you know and now I show it weekly

2364
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:26,819
yeah

2365
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:28,619
you know and

2366
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:30,238
you know so I just I just thought it

2367
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:31,920
would be it would be cool because this

2368
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:34,019
era is like right before kind of Matt

2369
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,119
came into things yeah

2370
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:39,239
which is like I apologize because I keep

2371
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:42,238
trying to get uh shows done where I make

2372
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:45,738
it like more matte era than mine

2373
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:48,000
um because there's a lot smaller

2374
01:29:45,738 --> 01:29:49,259
there's an era where like you know I was

2375
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,539
having a bunch of kids and had some

2376
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:54,119
issues or whatever and and Matt was

2377
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:56,760
super engaged uh when I was a little

2378
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:58,319
less engaged but so far I you know I'm

2379
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:00,840
gonna drag him Kicking and Screaming

2380
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:02,759
into his era where it's mostly him

2381
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,380
talking and me shutting up but he keeps

2382
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,239
making us do these things where it's

2383
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:09,300
it's a little older

2384
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:11,339
stuff yeah I think I think it's a lot

2385
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:12,900
too because I've been you know doing the

2386
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:14,159
live feed for a long time and I think

2387
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:16,379
for

2388
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:18,119
this many years I think people are more

2389
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:20,880
excited to hear from someone else for a

2390
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:22,859
bit and I I'm excited to hear like from

2391
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,960
an era I wasn't a part of and I think

2392
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:26,399
nobody gives a [ __ ] to hear what I have

2393
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,198
to say about something I wasn't a part

2394
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,719
of and I don't either so I think it's

2395
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:32,399
it's it's not just about my ego on this

2396
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:34,319
thing I think it's good to to get all

2397
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:36,238
aspects of history on here and you know

2398
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:38,579
there's a thing too where it's like I

2399
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:41,099
mean we didn't know back in the day

2400
01:30:38,579 --> 01:30:44,880
that the chem dog was going to become

2401
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:46,380
super famous uh yeah it stayed alive

2402
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:48,480
um because our buddy from Staten Island

2403
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:50,639
used to take it to

2404
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:52,319
like you could meet him outside of any

2405
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:56,400
Jerry Show Outside The Warfield and

2406
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:59,698
probably buy a 400 ounce yeah you know

2407
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:00,658
um you know all that you could uh you

2408
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:04,500
know

2409
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:07,019
um when when Jerry Garcia died you know

2410
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:09,238
um and he decided to and and you know

2411
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:10,920
skunk VA came back to California you

2412
01:31:09,238 --> 01:31:12,238
know he got cuts from homie and he

2413
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,800
started he started growing because all

2414
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:16,079
of a sudden he was settled down

2415
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:17,100
he wasn't traveling and seeing shows and

2416
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:18,899
stuff and that's where some of his

2417
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:21,780
Polaroids come from of that old skunk

2418
01:31:18,899 --> 01:31:23,399
cut you know and you know small group of

2419
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:24,779
us were growing the dog and we were

2420
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:27,000
always we called it you know no one

2421
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:30,420
called the chem 91 and all that that's

2422
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:33,238
all like later we all called it the dog

2423
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:35,219
and you know uh skunk VA and our buddy

2424
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:36,419
from Staten Island they mostly grew

2425
01:31:35,219 --> 01:31:37,500
organic

2426
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:40,319
um so they didn't want to call their

2427
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:42,539
weed chem yeah they weren't going to

2428
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:44,279
call it the chem dog I think that

2429
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:46,738
picture I think that picture the super

2430
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:47,939
skunk for me at least and what I'm

2431
01:31:46,738 --> 01:31:49,439
interested in is one of the most

2432
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:51,658
important pictures that anybody could

2433
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:52,979
have kept that and some of the Josh dog

2434
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:54,779
pictures

2435
01:31:52,979 --> 01:31:57,479
um yeah those are specifically the sour

2436
01:31:54,779 --> 01:31:59,880
picture and or pictures of sour pictures

2437
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:01,799
of the old Super Skunk super super

2438
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:04,800
[ __ ] important for solving that weird

2439
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:06,719
mystery of like was this super skunk cut

2440
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,880
the same as the original Super Skunk cut

2441
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:12,060
that is hard to that was hard to figure

2442
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:13,560
out yeah and uh it helped a lot I mean

2443
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:15,900
there's a thing too like part of the you

2444
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:17,100
know we don't need to go over it again

2445
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:19,379
um but we'll talk about it just really

2446
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:21,360
briefly we were talking about like Ron's

2447
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:23,639
parties and these and then the triangle

2448
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:26,639
and the dead scene and all that I mean

2449
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:28,739
the whole reason that the Francine

2450
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,719
um got taken out east and you know the

2451
01:32:28,738 --> 01:32:34,678
super skunk came West and all that stuff

2452
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:38,100
was all because of Jerry shows yeah that

2453
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:39,840
our friend and and skunk VA were at and

2454
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:42,300
friends of his from back east and

2455
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,100
smoking weed together at the show and

2456
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,600
then people wanting that stuff and so I

2457
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,400
don't need to you know I wasn't there I

2458
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,900
don't need to tell that part it's you

2459
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:50,579
know that's that's he's told that story

2460
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:53,099
pretty eloquently and stuff like that

2461
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:55,979
but it is it is showing how those

2462
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:57,719
circles overlapped yeah you know and one

2463
01:32:55,979 --> 01:33:00,718
led to the other and stuff like that you

2464
01:32:57,719 --> 01:33:02,460
know and so you know huh let's lock in

2465
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,380
Skunk the a for next week next Friday's

2466
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:06,899
got the aop on and he will be happy to

2467
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:08,100
to be performing thank you skunkier I

2468
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:11,339
don't know if you said I don't know if

2469
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:13,260
he's we locked him in but if we did um

2470
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,880
chat again this weekend I have a I have

2471
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:16,739
a line on something I thought was long

2472
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,199
lost that's dear to both of our hearts

2473
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:21,299
so I'm trying my damndest to make sure I

2474
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:24,299
can get it back to all of us uh yeah but

2475
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:28,920
we'll see you know and I do believe I'm

2476
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:30,719
not particularly uh uh superstitious

2477
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:32,760
um yeah but I do believe in in the

2478
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,319
energy of the plant and I do believe in

2479
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:36,780
the universe a bit like making things

2480
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:37,859
come to you and I can say for everyone

2481
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:40,439
out there

2482
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:42,299
uh for me at least the number one way

2483
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:43,678
that you get the cuts that you want and

2484
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:46,020
you get the things that you want in

2485
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:47,100
cannabis is by treating the plant the

2486
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:49,679
right way and having the right

2487
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:51,719
intentions yeah

2488
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:53,340
that's what I say because that that's

2489
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:55,739
going to long term that's going to get

2490
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:57,000
the right people to trust you yeah and

2491
01:33:55,738 --> 01:33:59,638
that's going to lead to what you want

2492
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,279
and I do believe the plant has an energy

2493
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:03,840
and I do believe the plant wants to uh

2494
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:06,719
wants to

2495
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,039
um you know wants to find people that'll

2496
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,679
keep it safe

2497
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:13,139
I agree I really do I don't know there's

2498
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:14,639
not I can't prove it obviously but I

2499
01:34:13,139 --> 01:34:18,420
believe that there's collectors out

2500
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:20,039
there and the plant hides yeah in places

2501
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:21,899
where it's hoping that someone cares

2502
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:25,139
about it and isn't just monetarily

2503
01:34:21,899 --> 01:34:28,079
attached to it yeah but loves it

2504
01:34:25,139 --> 01:34:29,279
you know and a lot of the things that I

2505
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:31,019
have

2506
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:32,399
um I wouldn't have because I would have

2507
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,659
gotten rid of them as soon as they were

2508
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,658
unpopular

2509
01:34:33,658 --> 01:34:38,519
yeah but I personally liked them and

2510
01:34:36,658 --> 01:34:40,439
cared about them and then there's

2511
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:42,540
friends of mine that feel the same way

2512
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:45,839
and that's why they have their [ __ ]

2513
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:48,060
you know yeah and so it's it's a general

2514
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,980
theme of among our friends yeah it's a

2515
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:52,260
theme you know and if you get it's like

2516
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:53,579
you get trusted in circles and like you

2517
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:56,340
know maybe we can go into this there's

2518
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:57,719
an aspect of like authenticity that we

2519
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:59,039
were going to talk about before right

2520
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:00,539
because we are kind of getting an hour

2521
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:01,979
and a half into it so maybe we can talk

2522
01:35:00,539 --> 01:35:04,500
a little bit about this and there's

2523
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:07,559
there's aspects of things where

2524
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:10,198
now that I'm being public okay and I'm

2525
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:12,179
starting to tell some of these stories

2526
01:35:10,198 --> 01:35:14,279
um I should say that there's a lot of

2527
01:35:12,179 --> 01:35:15,840
things that maybe like five or ten

2528
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:17,939
percent of the weed Community knows

2529
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,440
pretty well yeah

2530
01:35:17,939 --> 01:35:22,379
um that becomes difficult where how do

2531
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:24,359
you let the other 90 know yeah so

2532
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:26,039
there's a lot of like accepted facts

2533
01:35:24,359 --> 01:35:28,319
among small groups of people that want

2534
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:30,238
to trade this kind of information right

2535
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:33,420
sure and then you want to get it out

2536
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:35,698
there and you get [ __ ] attacked yeah

2537
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:37,260
and so you know Matt can attest that he

2538
01:35:35,698 --> 01:35:39,599
tried to get me to do this for a long

2539
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:41,820
ass time and I wouldn't

2540
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,380
right I mean well I mean you were just

2541
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:45,779
watching what happened to me and you're

2542
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:46,819
like [ __ ] that I don't want that in my

2543
01:35:45,779 --> 01:35:50,519
life

2544
01:35:46,819 --> 01:35:53,039
I mean I did I did Caleb's event up in

2545
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:54,600
uh that's right you know and it was like

2546
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:57,960
I showed my face I was in front of a

2547
01:35:54,600 --> 01:36:00,000
huge crowd yeah you know of people and I

2548
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,920
was just like oh my God you know I mean

2549
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,380
I didn't get my real name but it's still

2550
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:07,260
at the time it was difficult yeah but

2551
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:11,100
what it comes down to is that if

2552
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:12,780
what convinced me to do it is is like if

2553
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,340
you don't try to get some version of the

2554
01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:16,198
truth out there what you believe to be

2555
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:19,440
the truth and it's just going to be

2556
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:21,238
overwhelmed by [ __ ] yeah right and

2557
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:22,759
there's an aspect where it's like and I

2558
01:36:21,238 --> 01:36:25,738
really get upset about it sometimes

2559
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:27,420
where there's this IG thing where people

2560
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:30,779
pile on each other

2561
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:34,380
yeah okay and you know Matt's a villain

2562
01:36:30,779 --> 01:36:35,939
on IG yes I want to be to a lot of but

2563
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,819
to a lot of people that don't know him

2564
01:36:35,939 --> 01:36:41,698
in real life yeah you know and if we

2565
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:43,380
want to fast forward a bit before covid

2566
01:36:41,698 --> 01:36:45,059
um Matt and I

2567
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,618
there was other friends that helped and

2568
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:49,080
stuff like that so I'm not trying to

2569
01:36:46,618 --> 01:36:50,939
just to diss anyone I'm not mentioning

2570
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:53,760
but Matt and I and a few other friends

2571
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:55,500
kind of like uh got this idea to throw

2572
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,579
what we called like the can Illuminati

2573
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,859
party

2574
01:36:56,579 --> 01:37:01,019
and it was sort of kind of based on

2575
01:36:58,859 --> 01:37:03,359
Ron's old parties and some of those old

2576

Gatherings but more modern yeah and we

2577

2614
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,139

2615
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:24,840
those couple of years before covid

2616

2618
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:30,300
people we had you know CSI and body and

2619
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:32,820
kind of I mean you could go there with

2620
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:34,920
hundreds of people there yeah who's who

2621
01:38:32,819 --> 01:38:36,359
not everybody but a lot of people you

2622
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,060
know some people were busy or burned out

2623
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:40,679
or whatever you know yeah um and so we

2624
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:43,880
were trying to recreate some of those

2625
01:38:40,679 --> 01:38:46,859
like more innocent time parties yeah

2626
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:49,319
and you know and you know and I brought

2627
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:50,880
tons of weed and various friends brought

2628
01:38:49,319 --> 01:38:53,219
tons of weed and we just have like a

2629
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,800
huge table full of jars that were

2630
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:58,079
labeled and anybody could freely smoke

2631
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,360
yeah whatever they wanted

2632
01:38:58,079 --> 01:39:01,738
um and even even like just like the

2633
01:39:00,359 --> 01:39:04,019
forums there was a bunch of friends I

2634
01:39:01,738 --> 01:39:05,399
made on IG that some of the first time

2635
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:07,020
they smoked the headband some of the

2636
01:39:05,399 --> 01:39:09,118
first time they smoked the real chemd

2637
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:10,500
some of the first time they smoked this

2638
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:12,299
different stuff

2639
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:14,100
um was at these parties

2640
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:17,520
they might hear you talk about it but

2641
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:19,560
they don't actually see your week yeah

2642
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,820
you know and then they get a chance to

2643
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,139
do it and then you get to share a bunch

2644
01:39:20,819 --> 01:39:23,340
of your weed with friends and you get to

2645
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:26,579
do all these different kinds of things

2646
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:29,039
you know and so that part is really neat

2647
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:30,420
because that kind of I wish you went too

2648

2649
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:32,219

2650
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,739
um

2651
01:39:32,219 --> 01:39:36,239
you know there's uh you know it's it's

2652
01:39:34,738 --> 01:39:37,859
just like a who's who of people that

2653
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:40,500
have been around for a long time and you

2654
01:39:37,859 --> 01:39:42,679
would not believe how little beef there

2655
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,679
is

2656
01:39:43,939 --> 01:39:48,000
there wasn't any beef it was just a

2657
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:50,159
bunch of friends it was smoking out

2658
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,579
eating a bunch of food having a great

2659
01:39:50,158 --> 01:39:55,500
time you know trading beans trading Cuts

2660
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:58,079
Making Connections putting faces to

2661
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:01,859
names right yeah all that different

2662
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:03,238
types of stuff right and so you have an

2663
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:04,979
aspect where

2664
01:40:03,238 --> 01:40:06,238
we've had some issues this week where

2665
01:40:04,979 --> 01:40:08,579
you know you start having these talks

2666
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:10,859
week by week and like I said Matt's a

2667
01:40:08,579 --> 01:40:12,600
bit of a villain online and because now

2668
01:40:10,859 --> 01:40:14,399
I'm coming out and we haven't even hit

2669
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:17,340
some of the controversial topics yet but

2670
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:19,460
as I'm coming out now at all stuff

2671
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:21,539
um you start getting enemies

2672
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:23,340
you start getting people that are

2673
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:25,979
annoyed that people are listening to you

2674
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:29,760
or that believe your version of events

2675
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:31,559
or you know on IG or on various discords

2676
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,539
they want to like disparage your

2677
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,699
character and say you weren't around and

2678
01:40:33,539 --> 01:40:38,340
say that you didn't have anything or

2679
01:40:35,698 --> 01:40:41,219
your weed was [ __ ] or your seeds suck or

2680
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:43,860
whatever and honestly like it becomes

2681
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:46,260
really hard because a lot of people that

2682
01:40:43,859 --> 01:40:47,819
are listening you don't know the person

2683
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:49,380
you're siding with and you don't know

2684
01:40:47,819 --> 01:40:51,059
the person that you're against in real

2685
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:54,659
life yeah

2686
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:56,940
like in an honest real life yeah no you

2687
01:40:54,658 --> 01:40:59,519
know so it becomes hard how do you

2688
01:40:56,939 --> 01:41:00,899
choose you know how do you make stuff

2689
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,580
happen I mean there was people that were

2690
01:41:00,899 --> 01:41:06,238
accusing me this week of not even see

2691
01:41:02,579 --> 01:41:07,920
the chems until 08. yeah you know and

2692
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:10,138
and then I came out of nowhere and that

2693
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:12,600
all my stories are lies and not so it

2694
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:15,600
just means the stories are not so

2695
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:17,340
let's let's be fair though like the the

2696
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,800
people that were doing this were people

2697
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:21,600
that were in the Outer Circle of our

2698
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:23,820
friend group and never made it quite on

2699
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,960
the in circle because they were they

2700
01:41:23,819 --> 01:41:27,738
were bad people and they fought people

2701
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:30,359
over or they did certain things

2702
01:41:27,738 --> 01:41:32,819
yeah you know and that's my point right

2703
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:34,738
so Matt will come out and say this

2704
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:36,359
person's a scammer he's stealing Cuts

2705
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:37,618
he's trying to [ __ ] you over he's trying

2706
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:40,079
to take your money

2707
01:41:37,618 --> 01:41:42,479
yeah and then that person and like and

2708
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:43,738
and some Bots and like a bunch of fake

2709
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,559
accounts and a bunch of people that

2710
01:41:43,738 --> 01:41:48,419
bought seeds all attack Matt yeah you

2711
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,900
know he's a [ __ ] he's a Jew he's fat

2712
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:53,760
he's a biss he I got it

2713
01:41:50,899 --> 01:41:55,198
yeah Jewish Nazi all these various

2714
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,480
things they're getting attacked and so

2715
01:41:55,198 --> 01:41:59,158
as I become a public figure a little bit

2716
01:41:57,479 --> 01:42:00,959
like they start attacking oh I was at

2717
01:41:59,158 --> 01:42:03,000
that party as weed sucks this and that

2718
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,579
everything else and it's fine people to

2719
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,319
throw barbs it's part of it yeah right

2720
01:42:05,579 --> 01:42:10,260
and I'm not even saying you should trust

2721
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:13,139
me but what I am saying is that you know

2722
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:14,159
weed as a lot of people lived in the

2723
01:42:13,139 --> 01:42:16,319
shadows

2724
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:17,759
yeah and it's not documented and the

2725
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:20,819
reason why we're doing a bunch of these

2726
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:22,440
stories is because we want to get oral

2727
01:42:20,819 --> 01:42:24,059
history out there and we want to do it

2728
01:42:22,439 --> 01:42:26,099
in a conversational fashion that doesn't

2729
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:28,500
bore you to death yeah

2730
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:30,119
and we try to do that and then that

2731
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:33,658
steps on toes and then people are

2732
01:42:30,118 --> 01:42:34,799
Furious and so they they can't [ __ ] with

2733
01:42:33,658 --> 01:42:36,359
the story

2734
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,679

2737
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:44,100
you're a liar they say oh I know for a

2738

refuting a bunch of [ __ ] you know

2746
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:06,779

2749
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:13,560
to get truth out there we're trying to

2750
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:15,060
to get truth that like we're not making

2751
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:16,860
any money off of

2752
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:19,800
you know a lot of these a lot of these

2753
01:43:16,859 --> 01:43:21,839
podcasts are like weed infomercials

2754
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:24,600

2755
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:26,819

2756
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:28,500
about you and why you're great and why

2757
01:43:26,819 --> 01:43:30,238
you're integral to the story and why

2758
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:32,579
you're a cannabis historian and why

2759
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:33,959
you're so amazing and this is going to

2760
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:35,519
help you make money

2761
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:38,039
[ __ ] I should have been inserting myself

2762
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,840
into all this old [ __ ] God damn it yeah

2763
01:43:38,039 --> 01:43:41,519
you know and it's like you do need you

2764
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:43,319
know we do plug for two or three minutes

2765
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,780
some stuff that Matt's doing or you know

2766
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:47,939
CSI or different people at times because

2767
01:43:45,779 --> 01:43:49,259
there is a financial element to like

2768
01:43:47,939 --> 01:43:52,439
making all these different types of

2769
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:54,539
stuff work right yeah to some degree

2770
01:43:52,439 --> 01:43:56,759
um but really what it is is that now

2771
01:43:54,539 --> 01:44:00,479
that I'm old and I'm in my mid-40s or

2772
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:02,460
whatever uh there might be people that

2773
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:04,439
are 23 that want to hear

2774
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:06,420
yeah or it might be 40 and want to hear

2775
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:08,039
the real truth and then eventually you

2776
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:10,679
just have to decide because there are

2777
01:44:08,039 --> 01:44:12,840
some real scumbags yeah that just come

2778
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:15,420
out and insert themselves and then rely

2779
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:16,980

2780
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:19,380

2835
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:11,399
um you know and that's the thing is like

2836
01:46:09,658 --> 01:46:13,500
a lot of times I'll talk about things in

2837
01:46:11,399 --> 01:46:14,819
like a general sense

2838
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:16,618
um because you start calling out

2839
01:46:14,819 --> 01:46:19,319
individual people and then the next week

2840
01:46:16,618 --> 01:46:22,859
of my life is [ __ ] bad [ __ ] trying

2841
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:25,019
to defend themselves yes and you know

2842
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:27,420
and blowing themselves up

2843
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:29,340
yeah and me and homie Matt and I and me

2844
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:32,039
and skunk via we know a lot of history

2845
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:34,020
yeah not all of it is not all of it is

2846
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:37,019
is beneficial to the people

2847
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:38,460
no unfortunately but then you can't you

2848
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:40,800
know it doesn't pay to spend your whole

2849
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:42,239
life trying to warn the fam Unity about

2850
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,820
you know jack off because it's

2851
01:46:42,238 --> 01:46:47,459
whack-a-mole yeah I tried that I really

2852
01:46:44,819 --> 01:46:50,819
did and and it just it did not pay off

2853
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:52,679
it was it was detrimental to my career I

2854
01:46:50,819 --> 01:46:55,500
will say I don't recommend people do

2855
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:58,560
that for any reason whatsoever if you

2856
01:46:55,500 --> 01:47:02,219
have a an interest in being successful

2857
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,600
yeah I mean I uh so yeah you know I mean

2858
01:47:02,219 --> 01:47:06,118
there's there's that aspect and so I'm

2859
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,800
not saying trust me or trust Matt I'm

2860
01:47:06,118 --> 01:47:09,359
saying like if if you're giving us your

2861
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,279
time every Friday night you get to talk

2862
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:12,658
to us at length and ask questions and

2863
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:15,779
stuff eventually

2864
01:47:12,658 --> 01:47:17,219
you have to maybe you can hear enough of

2865
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:18,479
things that you get a general sense of

2866
01:47:17,219 --> 01:47:21,840
Who We Are

2867
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:25,198
but I will say that IG is an image and

2868
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:28,860
that sociopaths are very very good at

2869
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:31,319
curating an image yeah you know they do

2870
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:32,759
best and um you know and yeah someone

2871
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:34,139
just said nobody's perfect people aren't

2872
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:36,780
perfect you're right

2873
01:47:34,139 --> 01:47:38,039
people aren't you know

2874
01:47:36,779 --> 01:47:39,539
um people aren't perfect and I'm not

2875
01:47:38,039 --> 01:47:42,060
even trying to judge people that's why

2876
01:47:39,539 --> 01:47:43,979
I'm not calling anybody out by name

2877
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:46,560
yeah I'm just saying a general I'm just

2878
01:47:43,979 --> 01:47:47,698
saying a general state of events I do

2879
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,060
have someone I was going to call out by

2880
01:47:47,698 --> 01:47:53,819
name but um it's uh it's getting late

2881
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:56,520
and there's one more big thing I wanna I

2882
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:59,340
wanna get put aside so it's not just my

2883
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:01,560
opinion I'm actually using their words

2884
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:03,480
um yeah I'm not gonna it's not even a

2885
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:05,340
big enough deal really but it'll just be

2886
01:48:03,479 --> 01:48:07,439
funny it'll be fun with someone I'd

2887
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:08,940
looked up to

2888
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:11,879
do it

2889
01:48:08,939 --> 01:48:13,979
do what whatever you're about to do or

2890
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:16,560
you're not no no I I I still need some

2891
01:48:13,979 --> 01:48:18,178
of the um the ultimate the details yeah

2892
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,400
yeah so because I don't want it just to

2893
01:48:18,179 --> 01:48:23,399
be my opinion I want it to be a dude's

2894
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:24,539
own words sure no I get it yeah so I

2895
01:48:23,399 --> 01:48:26,460
mean and that's kind of what we talk

2896
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:28,800
about like when people are like the can

2897
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:30,359
Illuminati you know yeah the can

2898
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,639
Illuminati is not like some kind of

2899
01:48:30,359 --> 01:48:34,979
organization or membership there's no

2900
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:37,739
dues you know there's no one that

2901
01:48:34,979 --> 01:48:39,959
controls it what it basically means is

2902
01:48:37,738 --> 01:48:41,939
that you're enough of a weed head that

2903
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:44,158
you care enough of the history to hold

2904
01:48:41,939 --> 01:48:45,839
on to strains to hold on to seeds to

2905
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:48,359
want to dig for the truth

2906
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:50,579
yeah and you talk to other people like

2907
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:52,079
that and then basically it's a it's a

2908
01:48:50,579 --> 01:48:54,359
like-minded group

2909
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:56,219
of people and we know who each other are

2910
01:48:54,359 --> 01:48:58,859
and it's like even amongst that group

2911
01:48:56,219 --> 01:49:00,899
there's not even really Trading

2912
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:03,420
no there's just like dude like once you

2913
01:49:00,899 --> 01:49:04,738
know it's like uh you know a skunk VA

2914
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:06,000
and I were talking earlier today about

2915
01:49:04,738 --> 01:49:08,879
it it's like we're not going to trade

2916
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,618
anything no like it's like oh you need a

2917
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,179
couple of these and and I can get you

2918
01:49:10,618 --> 01:49:14,039
this or whatever it's it's not like a

2919
01:49:12,179 --> 01:49:16,679
trade it's more just like

2920
01:49:14,039 --> 01:49:18,359
you know this is what I have this is

2921
01:49:16,679 --> 01:49:19,319
what you have yeah you know I don't

2922
01:49:18,359 --> 01:49:20,880
think there's anything wrong with

2923
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:22,439
trading because trading is perfectly

2924
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,760
acceptable especially if you don't know

2925
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:26,460
each other but once you've been personal

2926
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:28,800
friends for a couple of decades yeah

2927
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:30,960
it's just friends helping friends yeah

2928
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,420
you know and a lot of the ways that this

2929
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:35,099
stuff exists like you know our history

2930
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:36,420
that's really why I'm chatting is

2931
01:49:35,099 --> 01:49:38,880
because I don't want all of our history

2932
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:40,679
to be lost no

2933
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:43,020
I wanted to be out there in some kind of

2934
01:49:40,679 --> 01:49:45,300
form and it's almost all oral

2935
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:47,460
yeah and and with a lot of the forums

2936
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:49,739
going down over the years whether it be

2937
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:53,158
from the feds you know getting a hold of

2938
01:49:49,738 --> 01:49:55,579
the icmag server to uh you know can a

2939
01:49:53,158 --> 01:49:57,779
collective pot pimp any of the the the

2940
01:49:55,579 --> 01:50:00,719
seed Depot any of those that have gone

2941
01:49:57,779 --> 01:50:03,000
down they had a lot of uh information on

2942
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,739
them like sea Depot a lot of people that

2943
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,380
people look at today as old school

2944
01:50:04,738 --> 01:50:09,839
Heroes and whatnot or really trustworthy

2945
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:11,219
people all popped up on seed Depot and

2946
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:13,079
their whole history is gone because

2947
01:50:11,219 --> 01:50:14,460
that's that site was gone the dude

2948
01:50:13,079 --> 01:50:16,618
disappeared after [ __ ] everyone over

2949
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:18,000
that owned it so

2950
01:50:16,618 --> 01:50:19,799
um that's gone but it's in a lot of

2951
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,238
people's memories so this is really the

2952
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,219
only chance we have to put that out

2953
01:50:21,238 --> 01:50:24,658
there yeah and so we're just we're just

2954
01:50:23,219 --> 01:50:27,239
trying to We're just trying to like

2955
01:50:24,658 --> 01:50:29,460
regurgitate stuff and get it out there

2956
01:50:27,238 --> 01:50:31,379
and get different versions of things

2957
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:33,480
yeah you know

2958
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:36,000
um and and you know like like anything

2959
01:50:33,479 --> 01:50:38,218
you know some of these stories there's

2960
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,599
people that have different memories yeah

2961
01:50:38,219 --> 01:50:41,158
there's people that have different

2962
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:43,260
versions even like the three or four

2963
01:50:41,158 --> 01:50:44,819
people that were there might not tell

2964
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:46,440
the same Tale

2965
01:50:44,819 --> 01:50:48,658
yeah they were the ones that were there

2966
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:50,339
I know I got a nickname for being a

2967
01:50:48,658 --> 01:50:54,019
power bottom at the last party and I'm

2968
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:56,400
pretty sure I was power top pretty sure

2969
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:57,900
you know but I mean it's cool because

2970
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:00,238
then you get then you get you know these

2971
01:50:57,899 --> 01:51:01,979
parties these gatherings and stuff they

2972
01:51:00,238 --> 01:51:03,959
really are bonding

2973
01:51:01,979 --> 01:51:06,539
yeah these really are where human

2974
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:08,639
connections are made you get to smoke a

2975
01:51:06,539 --> 01:51:10,139
bunch of your good friends weed you get

2976
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:11,880
to see them in person you get to hear

2977
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:14,460
what their voice sounds like and and

2978
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:16,079
hear them laugh you get to break bread

2979
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:17,698
and food with people

2980
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:19,439
you know yeah

2981
01:51:17,698 --> 01:51:21,779
um and you get to share weed and share

2982
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:23,519
experiences and so I think that's you

2983
01:51:21,779 --> 01:51:26,939
know what maybe we can get the candle

2984
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:28,560
can Illuminati parties together again uh

2985
01:51:26,939 --> 01:51:29,819
now that kovid seems to be dying down

2986
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,739
and there's lots of people that are

2987
01:51:29,819 --> 01:51:34,500
either been infected or vaccinated and

2988
01:51:31,738 --> 01:51:35,879
it's not so much like the plague yeah it

2989
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:38,698
was for a few years where it was

2990
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:40,319
shutting [ __ ] down yeah um but those

2991
01:51:38,698 --> 01:51:42,059
kind of gatherings are important and so

2992
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:43,738
tonight you know we're almost at two

2993
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:46,199
hours so I'll probably shut up here in a

2994
01:51:43,738 --> 01:51:48,718
second but I just wanted to give like a

2995
01:51:46,198 --> 01:51:50,519
general random overview of some of the

2996
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:53,399
overlapping things that were happening

2997
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:55,260
in that era yeah it really set the stage

2998
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:57,238
for everything that came after

2999
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:58,619
yeah it was really where a lot of

3000
01:51:57,238 --> 01:52:00,299
friendships were made it was where a lot

3001
01:51:58,618 --> 01:52:02,519
of trading and a lot of seed exchange

3002
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:03,840
was done it was where a lot of cuttings

3003
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:06,960
and a lot of people smoking other

3004
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,880
people's weed and learning happened and

3005
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,618
then a lot of those guys

3006
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,699
um ended up becoming super well known in

3007
01:52:10,618 --> 01:52:14,460
the community

3008
01:52:11,698 --> 01:52:18,059
yeah you know

3009
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:20,039
um so you know it it it uh you know but

3010
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:22,199
you don't know it at the time

3011
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:23,880
no that's that's the funny thing about

3012
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:25,379
history is you don't know if you're if

3013
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,880
you're making it you don't know you know

3014
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:28,319
so

3015
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,579
um but really what it boils down to is

3016
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:32,279
we're all just people

3017
01:52:29,579 --> 01:52:34,439
some of us care about the plant

3018
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:36,899
yeah uh some of us care about wrapping

3019
01:52:34,439 --> 01:52:39,178
money and and and you know scamming

3020
01:52:36,899 --> 01:52:41,759
people and there's a big conflict

3021
01:52:39,179 --> 01:52:43,139
between those two right now yeah in the

3022
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:44,039
community there's been one for a long

3023
01:52:43,139 --> 01:52:46,679
time

3024
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:48,000
yeah but it's gotten more public and I

3025
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:50,880
mean even like you know Matt's been

3026
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,319
doxed before you know and even some of

3027
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:53,460
those comments I was referencing that

3028
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:55,380
we're not going to mention this week

3029
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:58,139
people were saying my real name

3030
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:59,639
yeah um not that I cared to some degree

3031
01:52:58,139 --> 01:53:02,400
because

3032
01:52:59,639 --> 01:53:05,219
um it's it you know like I'm showing my

3033
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:06,359
face every week so yeah principle of the

3034
01:53:05,219 --> 01:53:08,579
thing though you're not saying your

3035
01:53:06,359 --> 01:53:10,198
Christian name every week no I'm not

3036
01:53:08,579 --> 01:53:12,479
saying my Christian name every week or

3037
01:53:10,198 --> 01:53:14,579
anything like that you know and so you

3038
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:16,379
know but but what's funny about that is

3039
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:18,118
that I can use that later to prove

3040
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:20,219
something that will like blow them up in

3041
01:53:18,118 --> 01:53:22,559
the face yes

3042
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:25,739
yeah and I've been pushed enough enough

3043
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:27,539
times by this human being to that you

3044
01:53:25,738 --> 01:53:30,059
know just uh it sucks to have to do it

3045
01:53:27,539 --> 01:53:32,158
but because they're saying such extreme

3046
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:33,719
[ __ ] like there's only a few things in

3047
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:35,879
life that I take real personal is when

3048
01:53:33,719 --> 01:53:39,599
you talk about my friends family or you

3049
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:42,179
