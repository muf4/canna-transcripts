00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,299
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,099
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,900
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,059
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,419
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,140
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,699
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,439
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,340
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,340
to the underground

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,679
welcome breeder Syndicate I'm here with

19
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,659
my buddy thousand fold and we will be

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,079
talking about why cookies is the

21
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:52,319
beginning of the end of modern breeding

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,520
and maybe some ways that we can change

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,378
that hopefully fix that and what

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,079
composes some of these lines and why

25
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,659
it's it's headed the directions it's

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,280
it's gone so yeah thank you for joining

27
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,719
me thousand

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,540
hey Matt

29
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,280
um yeah so I guess what would make sense

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,420
here is if we do a little recap of what

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,599
the major components of the cookies

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,879
family might be absolutely so first off

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,059
I want to talk about what is cookies

34
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:23,099
itself and to talk about cookies we also

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,359
have to talk about another clone that

36
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,559
came out around the same time which was

37
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,079
cherry pie

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,820
also animal cookies hit the scene at the

39
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,640
same time but it's much less relevant it

40
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:35,039
looks like more of a a forum cookie

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,780
sister but for for all intents and

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,000
purposes we need to talk about which

43
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,920
cookies because there were multiple

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,078
cookies cuts from cookie fan that people

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,200
were growing around the same time

46
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,039
so we have the thin mint cut from cookie

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,618
fam

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,899
my first introduction to cookies was

49
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:52,739
what was called Girl Scout cookies at

50
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,439
the time

51
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,298
but later on became called The Forum cut

52
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,199
now the thin mint cut and the forearm

53
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,420
cut are two separate Cuts cookie fam has

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,180
always stated that the thin mint cut

55
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,780
came before The Forum cut so when we

56
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,640
refer to cookies in this episode we are

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,759
going to be referring to the thin mint

58
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:17,399
cut proper unless we specify Forum

59
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,859
cookies now the thin mint cut was said

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,480
to be an OG Kush that they had from

61
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,920
Florida that they refer to as the Flo

62
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,159
Rida OG

63
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,559
cross to what is called the F1 derb

64
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,780
which has been kind of a controversial

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,219
really rare cut that they don't really

66
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,378
talk about too much they don't really

67
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,139
talk about what's in it and when they do

68
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,340
it didn't make a lot of sense and

69
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,738
um yeah

70
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,319
along that same time we have the Cherry

71
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,140
Pie that came out which is my favorite

72
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,878
of most of them I might add that in and

73
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,039
that's supposedly a granddaddy purple

74
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,620
crossed to an F1 derb

75
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,840
Granddaddy Purple itself is an Urkel

76
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,719
Salmon Creek big bud hybrid most likely

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,878
made by Chris Yaki who is no longer

78
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,318
around to really ask about it this is

79
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,818
the best knowledge we have for this

80
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,098
moment

81
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,958
um the GDP is a very Urkle dominant

82
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,939
expression itself and a lot of people

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,039
would confuse the two and they were

84
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,139
passed interchangeably for a long time

85
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,060
uh but cherry pie does a good job of

86
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,518
expressing some of the F1 derb traits

87
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,739
and the cherry or I'm sorry and the

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,900
Urkel traits and that's what you get

89
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,939
with cherry pie

90
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,239
um cherry pie became a lot less

91
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:29,699
important as cookie fan breeding carried

92
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,980
on though at the time I'm mentioning it

93
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,899
because it is very integral and often a

94
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,658
lot of people confuse the genetics in

95
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,719
cookies with the genetics in Cherry Pie

96
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:43,139
and a lot of that I think is because

97
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:47,219
what became known as The Forum cut seems

98
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:50,639
to be showing traits from both the the

99
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:53,280
Cherry Pie and what cookie fam refers to

100
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,179
as the Thin Mint or cookies

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,299
um when you S1 or have you know hermed

102
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,680
bag seed self to bag seed of forum

103
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,780
cookies you can find a lot of Urkle

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
traits in it and that's why that tells

105
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,799
me that that is most likely a hybrid of

106
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,179
these two and that cookie fam probably

107
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,120
was right when they were saying that

108
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,480
thin mint came first in all in all logic

109
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,660
it kind of works out that way for me

110
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,039
um so those are the the main basis for

111
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,780
what we're going to be talking about and

112
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,560
again the F1 derb was kind of a rare

113
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:27,418
clone uh me and CSI have been have been

114
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,918
working with it um trying to figure it

115
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,198
out I worked out I worked with it really

116
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,039
early on made a few crosses and Let It

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,419
Go

118
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,759
um mostly because there was no interest

119
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,680
really in the F1 durb it wasn't really

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,919
talked about a lot by by Cookie fam so

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,240
it didn't get the hype

122
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,339
and someone who's a little bit you know

123
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
far away I didn't even know if Wonder

124
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,599
was like a real thing and I think that a

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,300
lot of people felt that as well I think

126
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,560
I think in America it's the same way um

127
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,139
people still argue on Instagram

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,819
constantly like when me or CSI post to

129
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,740
fiction to be like that's fake that's

130
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,379
not real that's not a real thing and

131
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,300
like yeah it is it's the real thing it's

132
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,759
been it's been the same cut that's been

133
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,418
passed as F1 derp since since the

134
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,040
beginning since we got it and um we we

135
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:13,079
decided that we were going to cross it

136
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,939
to some of these other Cuts be it the

137
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,899
thin mint we have that

138
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,899
um

139
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,819
the the F ones are being self so we can

140
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,439
see what other kind of traits are inside

141
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,478
the F1 dirt because it is an interesting

142
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,000
cut very interesting cut

143
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,680
um it's got swollen

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,319
bubbly

145
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,319
Brax a lot like cookies right like

146
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,478
that's one of its main traits it's very

147
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,060
low yielding a lot like cookies it's a

148
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:42,478
little more Airy like uh like a Durban

149
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,978
would be as very Anis Anis and a seed

150
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,199
type smells to it which would be like

151
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:48,599
root beer or black licorice has some

152
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,460
gingerbread and some some urine type

153
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,740
smells to it to be honest as after it

154
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,560
cures does it bring the purple black

155
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,439
leaves as well it does have some purple

156
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,660
traits to it especially on the leaves

157
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,038
um the stems early on in veg you can see

158
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,479
those beautiful purple traits but yeah

159
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:05,759
it does it does have some nice purple

160
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,538
traits that it brings with it as well

161
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,080
um

162
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,879
I'm not sure 100 what it is but since

163
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,560
these Durban Poison did have that black

164
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,478
licorice in it

165
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,839
um the gingerbread being an extension of

166
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:20,579
that some of the pissiness I'm not sure

167
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,258
I'm not sure

168
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,659
um I I would speculate but it would be

169
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,879
going out on a limb for sure that maybe

170
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,939
OG was crossed into it very early on

171
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,800
into the Scentsy Durban Poison skunk one

172
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,719
and that that's what we get with the F1

173
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,280
dirt but that's pure speculation and

174
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,539
it's only because of

175
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:41,219
how the the blood structure of all of it

176
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:44,219
um the the smells are very different

177
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,860
from OG Kush it's a it's a long stretch

178
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,080
from OG Kush so it's it's very very much

179
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,879
speculation but the small leaves

180
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,258
um around the buds the way they look are

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,779
very OG Kush

182
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,340
um the the resin production reminds me a

183
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,239
lot of like a triangle and stuff like

184
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,459
that

185
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,620
um and again I want to go back to the uh

186
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,120
Flo Rida OG as well since that's one of

187
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,340
the main components

188
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,699
um this has been grown side by side by

189
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,619
uh not so growing triangle uh triangle

190
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,000
Kush and flow right OG side by side

191
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,800
because for a long time we were

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,600
wondering since both of these Cuts or

193
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,220
early OG Kush cuts from Florida are they

194
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,840
the same cut you know were they just

195
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,520
passed under different names

196
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,619
so it took a while but we were able to

197
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,258
rejoin these cuts and have them grown

198
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,418
side by side and by not so's opinion

199
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,538
they are not the same cut they are not

200
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:32,939
they are definitely similar types of ogs

201
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:34,620
but because of specific traits a

202
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,019
triangle has and specific traits the Flo

203
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,180
Rida has which I'll leave that to not so

204
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,019
to talk about in another show

205
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,879
um

206
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,318
we were able to tell that they are

207
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,598
probably two different cuts and that

208
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,199
that makes up the basis for

209
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:52,680
what cookies is the directions it breeds

210
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,538
and again I would break it down to GDP

211
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,639
Urkel

212
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:57,978
Flo Rida OG Kush which is really just an

213
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,900
OG cush

214
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:03,959
the F1 derp which is probably a Durban

215
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,519
Poison skunk one hybrid

216
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,899
and

217
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,000
um yeah I think that's the the main

218
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,698
components if I didn't miss anything so

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,439
so that's the first layer of the inbred

220
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,300
pyramid of course yeah this is the first

221
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,639
layer of the inbred pyramid and like at

222
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,620
this layer like I don't see a whole lot

223
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,360
wrong I don't see a whole lot wrong with

224
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,519
the direction of reading when this hit

225
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,740
the scene at the time

226
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,899
um when cookies popped up I remember

227
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,579
looking at the pictures and thinking and

228
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,659
Cherry Pie as well because I saw both at

229
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,819
the same time

230
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,979
and I was like wow these are absolutely

231
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,099
unique beautiful plants for their resin

232
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,379
production their blood structure shape

233
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,820
um the Brax all of it it was a very

234
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:43,259
unique but I thought also thought

235
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,180
there's no way this will ever be

236
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,919
commercial because it is so low yielding

237
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,120
and that's why I took an interest in it

238
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,159
because I was like there's no this will

239
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,560
never be commercial it'll never catch on

240
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,259
so I took an interest in breeding with

241
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,299
it and I tried to take it some new novel

242
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,519
directions like instead of just making

243
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,439
more of itself I wanted to see more of

244
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,399
what it could bring to other existing

245
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,300
things

246
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,700
and yeah those are the directions I was

247
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:11,120
hoping it would go

248
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,800
um and that most breeders have taken

249
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,980
lines over the years

250
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,639
and cut specifically clone onlys

251
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,519
um

252
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,500
and I can talk about maybe why the the

253
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,039
politics of that have changed and how

254
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,440
the politics changing sort of enabled

255
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,719
this to happen right like for a long

256
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,720
time feminized seeds were very almost

257
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
demonized like religiously demonized

258
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,139
um

259
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,759
I was often told you know as were other

260
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,379
Femme breeders at the time you know in

261
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,539
the in the mid-2000s that we were

262
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,580
ruining the gene pool this isn't the way

263
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,439
God intended it to be

264
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,580
um we were destroying the chromosome so

265
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,459
it was permanently going to destroy

266
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,959
cannabis gene pool you know and and

267
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:54,119
basically it's just not not how it's

268
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,359
supposed to be it's trash it's a cheap

269
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,039
way to breed it's cheating it's quick

270
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,600
it's you know there are so many

271
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,958
different reasons of why people didn't

272
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,180
like it against God against God was a

273
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,439
real real thing and like it's still a

274
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,778
it's still something that people throw

275
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,519
at me like it's not natural and I can go

276
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:13,139
into why that's the worst argument out

277
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,919
of all of them

278
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,419
um but I mean in nature cannabis is

279
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,179
naturally intersex

280
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:23,639
as humans we want we've bred away from

281
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,679
that trait the intersex trait

282
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,080
we've done as best we can to remove that

283
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:32,278
trait from the gene pool however in

284
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:35,940
nature it's there and man has has

285
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:38,278
removed it by reintroducing intersex

286
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,839
traits we're actually taking it back to

287
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,700
where nature had it technically if you

288
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,200
really want to get technical like it's

289
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,600
an argument getting closer we're getting

290
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,920
closer to God again right back closer to

291
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,019
God you know that's where we want to be

292
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,019
right right so

293
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,120
um yeah during those times it wasn't as

294
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,620
proper you didn't want people to know

295
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,940
you were making Femme seeds especially

296
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,159
if you were whereas once we hit to about

297
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,160
2013 14 15

298
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,259
them breeding became real popular as as

299
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,000
growing became more popular in America

300
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,799
and it wasn't just the old Legacy

301
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,139
Growers and it was getting more popular

302
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,838
as States became online and new Growers

303
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,399
were popping in Benedict seeds weren't a

304
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,300
Bad Thing necessarily to these customers

305
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,500
because they didn't want to deal with

306
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,019
males in the first place and they

307
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,159
weren't really concerned about

308
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:25,078
chromosomes or genetics it hadn't come

309
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,120
into play in their brain so

310
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:30,179
the the marketing finally started to

311
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,339
take hold on fem seeds and because of

312
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:35,159
that we started to see a lot of people

313
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,839
making feminized crosses of cookies

314
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,360
including myself

315
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,640
um we would do self inbreeding of of

316
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,579
this cookies we'd use self-reading of

317
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,159
cherry pie you know and then we'd make

318
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:49,919
processes of these and sell these and

319
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,419
that's because it was more allowable and

320
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,179
people weren't getting as much pushback

321
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,860
there were thousands of people doing the

322
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,019
same thing with cookies and all the

323
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,060
cookies hybrids they weren't getting the

324
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,959
pushback that we had seen for a decade

325
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:06,179
prior and I think this allowed

326
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,879
this this culture to take hold of

327
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,958
selfing feminized seeds uh in the U.S to

328
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,480
take hold

329
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,739
and in doing so took breeding in a

330
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,019
completely different direction than it

331
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,480
had ever gone before

332
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,459
yeah

333
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,399
so

334
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:26,278
from there we have what what became

335
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,659
known as the sunset sherbert

336
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,860
we have

337
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,480
uh

338
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,700
gelato

339
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,800
we have things like uh Skittles pop-up

340
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,959
we have

341
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,059
uh what's the other runs we have things

342
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,500
like this all pop up the key lime so

343
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,359
this is the next the next Generation

344
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,059
this is the next generation of where

345
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,579
most of the popularity

346
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,958
took the cookies lens and when I say

347
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:53,278
that there are so many breeders out

348
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,039
there who have done unique novel things

349
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,139
with cookies when it first came out made

350
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,179
crazy crazy process I mean we even had

351
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,220
like chocolate Thai

352
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,739
um across the cookies we had like the 95

353
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,300
Scentsy star across the cookies

354
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,700
um a lot of strawberry cookies early on

355
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:10,740
just taking it different directions but

356
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,320
a lot of people were more interested in

357
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,980
what they could do in their room with a

358
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,160
tent and some reversal spray and just

359
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,159
cookies all right and what we started

360
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:26,699
seeing pop up were the cookies S1

361
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,919
Revolution the bagseed revolution

362
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,420
um cookies was so in demand you know six

363
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:32,519
thousand a pound so people were trying

364
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,500
to find any seeds they could find in the

365
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,000
bags of weed

366
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,559
um and cookies did a good job of trying

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,759
to remove those seeds like they really

368
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,899
tried to pick the seeds out and I don't

369
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,819
blame them because they didn't want the

370
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,799
competitors and that's when the

371
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,660
marketing of fortune cookies they call

372
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,059
things fortune cookies or you know

373
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:50,338
fookies or whatever they wanted to call

374
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,500
it to to try to denounce any of the bag

375
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,000
seed coming out but people were finding

376
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,980
their own bag seeds and giving it new

377
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,958
names uh they name it after themselves

378
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,759
cookies like they call it Riot cookies

379
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,319
or whatever for that was just an example

380
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,919
I didn't have that

381
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,740
um

382
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,019
we also had people that were kind of

383
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,579
tangentially friends with the cookie fam

384
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,980
doing some work

385
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:14,458
and in that group there was a dude named

386
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,740
Mario also referred to as sherbinsky and

387
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,239
he popularized something called Sunset

388
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,980
sherbet

389
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,200
um we also have something he did called

390
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,480
gelato and

391
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,060
some of what comprises that stuff is

392
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,759
something he had called the pink panties

393
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,439
now I grew the pink panties cut for a

394
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,299
while and I was trying to figure out

395
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,100
what exactly it was

396
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,419
um online there's not a lot of

397
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,000
consistency

398
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:42,958
about what it is some say it's a Burmese

399
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,820
land Race Across to no Florida OG the

400
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,559
Flo Rida OG

401
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,600
um I find that hard to believe because

402
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,719
of Burmese land race you know Thai

403
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,820
Burmese that's a 24 weaker and uh you

404
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,940
know 20 to 24 weaker I mean if you're

405
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,320
lucky maybe a work line would be 14

406
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,720
weeks you know something like that but

407
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,420
I'm not seeing that I did not see that

408
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,360
can I just ask how white spreads was the

409
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:09,659
pink panties not at all not at all about

410
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,539
like F1 derb um it never despite it

411
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:15,299
being in the parental lineage because of

412
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:18,419
the people that were buying cookies gear

413
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:19,679
and interested in it at this point I had

414
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,599
already kind of walked away I was not

415
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,919
interested much in cookies proper people

416
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,180
had already made a bunch of crosses with

417
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,919
it it was already starting to be inbred

418
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,359
so I lost a lot of interest in it but I

419
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,000
was interested in some of the the

420
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,699
parentage and um the F1 Durban the

421
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,500
panties were not widely passed and and

422
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,179
again people would have had to have been

423
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,820
into parentage to hunt these cuts and

424
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:41,039
one thing these cuts and like if you

425
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,199
look up the parentage for pink panties

426
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,879
it's not even really consistent so like

427
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,679
I can't imagine there being a lot of

428
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,139
hype about something that like sounds

429
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,578
like a Burmese land Race Across to an OG

430
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,839
like there wouldn't be a lot of interest

431
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:54,120
in that I don't think

432
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,160
yeah yeah so those two were kind of at

433
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,560
the limits of what we we know for sure

434
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,919
yeah for sure and and

435
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,539
like looking at it I would guess and

436
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,479
because I've read a few places that

437
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:10,139
Burmese cush was used or was in the room

438
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,420
that would fit a lot better with

439
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,100
that than a Burmese land race however

440
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:16,259
like

441
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,060
what this looked like was some sort of

442
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,639
blackberry hybrid

443
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,799
um it was low potency a little Airy

444
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,759
not a ton of resin production a little

445
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,399
fruity

446
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,078
and it's I've used it in projects but

447
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,698
it's not something I would continue to

448
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,379
use in projects I was just interested to

449
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,139
see how it bred was something that I

450
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,958
know to see what else was in there

451
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:39,360
um it would to me it's an odd choice to

452
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,159
use in a popular line nonetheless it's

453
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,379
supposedly what's in these lines in the

454
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,480
in the sunset shirt

455
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:49,919
um the sunset sure supposedly was made

456
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,680
in uh what I think the area of

457
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,778
where he made it was called Sunset area

458
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,099
which is why it's called Sunset sure but

459
00:16:54,778 --> 00:17:00,000
there's also something called the green

460
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,920
sherb which is probably what is the mom

461
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,619
of Skittles and some sort of cherry pie

462
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,240
hybrid or bag seed as best we know

463
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,458
um it was often referred to as key lime

464
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,318
pie and pastas key lime pie really cool

465
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,980
cut really cool cut really super

466
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:17,578
resinous more narrow Leaf like thin mint

467
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,259
um but just resin and and lots of gas a

468
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,359
little bit of citrus but it's nice it's

469
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,099
a really nice cut

470
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,139
um but the sunset shrub was completely

471
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,879
different than the grain sure I'm not

472
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,160
sure which came first but when we refer

473
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,080
to Sunset sherbet we're not referring to

474
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,880
the green sherbet and I have a hard time

475
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,339
pronouncing Sherbert or sherbet because

476
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,460
it's spelled sherbet there's no art so

477
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:40,199
just wanted to point that part out

478
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,940
people make a big deal of the fact that

479
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,640
there's no R in that but yeah yeah it

480
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,980
drives me nuts no R in that why people

481
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,380
say sherbet

482
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,620
um and then we have the gelato which for

483
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,380
me is probably like personally in my

484
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:58,019
opinion is the end of this tale it's the

485
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,059
end of the tale of cookies the end of

486
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,519
the tale of breeding with cookies at

487
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:05,220
least self-breeding with cookies it is

488
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,918
the to me gelato 33 specifically that

489
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,339
clone is a fine example of what happens

490
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,220
when you inbreed cookies and you keep

491
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:16,379
trying to inbreed it further and why I

492
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,319
say that is because I've actually self

493
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,200
gelato 33 the Clone and what you get

494
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:25,740
when you sell gelato 33 the Clone it's

495
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,080
gelato 33. you get a very uniform inbred

496
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,759
line of gelato 33 and it for people to

497
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,019
know gelato 33 it's kind of gassy

498
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,319
depending on how you grow it kind of

499
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:36,359
gassy kind of grapey good yielding

500
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,859
okay resin production but not as good as

501
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:41,459
some of the other gelatos obviously

502
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:43,918
better than most Cuts but the high is

503
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,860
very to most people is what we would

504
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,820
consider very Bland boring the 20 minute

505
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:53,819
kind of narcotic not too unique type

506
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:57,178
high and that's what I saw when in

507
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:59,220
braiding gelato and like I said 33 the

508
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,980
reason I bring this up is because if you

509
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,419
sell like the 45 or the 41 you're still

510
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,419
going to end up with a lot of the

511
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,799
examples of what 33 looks like by doing

512
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,538
that because it is the most common

513
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,900
example of what you get from selfing

514
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:16,798
those the the hybrid of uh thin mints

515
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:19,200
and sunset sherbet and it seems like to

516
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,058
me gelato is the Clone that took hold

517
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,558
the name

518
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,839
um what people tended to use because you

519
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,359
have like the acai gelato expression you

520
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,500
have the the Mochi gelato expression

521
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,119
like these are all different numbers

522
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,679
that I'm not really super familiar with

523
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,619
you know like

524
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,240
they're all these little takes that were

525
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,479
supposedly different expressions of

526
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,940
gelato or even bag self to bag seed of

527
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,460
gelato popping up

528
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,558
and people have taken hold on these

529
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,480
specific cuts and just keep inbreding

530
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,000
them or crossing them to each other to

531
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,579
make more new named gelatos

532
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,380
and to me that's what this Market is and

533
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,720
whether they're calling it gelato where

534
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,940
they're calling it sherb whether they're

535
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,179
calling it you know uh any number of

536
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,519
things it doesn't really matter because

537
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,559
that's where we're at and that's why

538
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,139
almost everything you're looking at

539
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:11,759
looks the same

540
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,980
um wedding cake another one that people

541
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,980
talk about to me is just what happens

542
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,980
when you inbreed OG Kush you get a

543
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,839
shitload of wedding cake a very Bland

544
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,940
kind of creamy

545
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,918
um some say cakey but I'd say like uh

546
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,940
creamy

547
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,580
just Bland hash plant type OG Kush very

548
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,620
frosty looks great a little bit of

549
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:38,339
purple to it but it's just inbreeding OG

550
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:41,279
Kush over and over and over what about

551
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:43,079
um runs good and runs supposedly was a

552
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,599
uh gelato 33

553
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,939
cross to either a reverse Skittles or a

554
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,918
gelato 33 hermion Skittles it's never

555
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,259
really been clearly stated I made a

556
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,940
gelato 33z Cube which is this gittles

557
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,859
bx3

558
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,360
um early on and there was some okay

559
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:59,038
stuff in it but because there was an

560
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,199
outcross in this e-cube it was more

561
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,200
variant but watching what happens when

562
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,580
you cross gelato 33 to Skittles itself

563
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,279
the Clone

564
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:12,779
ends up being a lot of either Skittles

565
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:16,500
which is like citrus grapefruit

566
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:19,678
to the extreme like or you get more

567
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,919
gelato and inbred cookies

568
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,100
um but going in that Skittles Direction

569
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,400
you really just get a lot of that Citrus

570
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:30,959
Skittles stuff and while it's different

571
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,820
than a cookies proper and it's a

572
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,120
different direction than gelato

573
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,500
because it's inbred cookie still in a

574
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,479
way even though there were some other

575
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,279
outcrosses along the way because it's

576
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,900
inbred cookies still taking these

577
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,658
Skittles in further directions into

578
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,640
itself will just beget more Skittles

579
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,380
more uniform versions of Skittles and if

580
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,840
you love Skittles that's awesome but if

581
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,400
you if you don't want a bunch of

582
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,619
Skittles Terps and every single cross

583
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,780
that you make or outcross then it's like

584
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,219
a kind of a bad direction to go you know

585
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,619
like Skittles is great for one-off

586
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,940
crosses but inbred it makes it a lot

587
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,519
harder

588
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,380
yeah yeah so you're kind of you're kind

589
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,759
of getting to the summary of what I

590
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,580
think crybaby mentioned in the chat

591
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,859
yesterday which was uh quote unquote

592
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:16,678
cookies gets worse the further down you

593
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:19,979
go yeah right that's that's a paraphrase

594
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,140
I guess of what you were just describing

595
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,179
you know what actually could you talk us

596
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,000
some about the the Flo Rida OG and the

597
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,860
triangle and the differences

598
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,019
sure I could I mean where do you I mean

599
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:32,699
are we are we just gonna Pat are we just

600
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:35,400
gonna like patch this in at some point

601
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,080
yep

602
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,500
I mean so do you want me to do you want

603
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:43,439
me to start with the Flowrider story

604
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,480
yeah that'd be great actually

605
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,298
okay

606
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,779
um so let's see it's it's uh it's gonna

607
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:53,519
be about 53 minutes in I guess yep

608
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:56,038
all right so

609
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,740
um my uh my experience with the

610
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,720
Flowrider is is a little weird

611
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,440
um in the sense that

612
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,819
um

613
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:10,080
I was growing a bunch of super skunk

614
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:12,259
and super dog hybrids Maui chem dog uh

615
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,839
what people call the chem 91 these days

616
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:17,640
uh and things of that nature right and I

617
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,379
was bringing most of it down to the bay

618
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,820
to a friend of mine

619
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,020
and

620
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:27,480
you know he unbeknownst to me at this

621
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:30,839
point in the early 2000s I really had no

622
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,900
idea being stuck in Mendo that there was

623
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,298
this like like Kush craze that had

624
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,538
started in LA and that people were

625
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:41,220
getting ridiculous pricing for cushes in

626
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:44,279
LA

627
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:50,100
um and so around spring 04

628
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:51,899
my buddy was like I want you to

629
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:54,119
stop growing everything that you're

630
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,340
growing as far as for com for commercial

631
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,558
sale in California

632
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,240
um and I want you to grow this and I'll

633
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,058
take every bit of it and you can give it

634
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,259
to a couple close trusted friends but I

635
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:06,359
don't want it to get out and I want to

636
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:10,379
make sure you give me all of it yeah

637
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:12,959
right and so I went down there uh to the

638
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,220
bay and I got uh this Kush cut and I

639
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,460
asked him what it was and he just said

640
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:20,460
it was kush the real kush later on I

641
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,279
found out it ended up being what people

642
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,919
know now is the Flow Rider yeah but I

643
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:29,759
got that in you know spring like

644
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,740
probably April May of 04. okay right and

645
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,599
I started growing quite a bit of it I

646
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,460
didn't realize he was giving me the

647
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,779
exact same number that I was getting for

648
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,779
everything else

649
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:41,940
I didn't realize at all that he was

650
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,460
literally like getting it for low fours

651
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,080
and flipping it for like mid sixes yeah

652
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,079
I just killed

653
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,119
oh I was kind of getting jacked but I

654
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:54,418
didn't but you know I mean at the same

655
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,158
point it's like you know I felt like it

656
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,720
was fair you know I felt like the price

657
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,220
I was getting was fair because it was

658
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,038
comparable with everything else I was

659
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,940
getting and it was easy and whatnot and

660
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:04,798
so

661
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,900
you know

662
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,819
um and then how long did it how long did

663
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,500
it take you to get good at growing Flo

664
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:13,319
Rida because Kush at the time it was new

665
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,500
and it's kind of hard to grow

666
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:20,158
um it actually wasn't that hard for me

667
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,859
to get good at growing it uh that didn't

668
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:27,179
take any time at all to be honest

669
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:29,879
um what did take some time was figuring

670
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:32,519
out how to get it to yield well

671
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,520
yeah in your room like I got high

672
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,319
quality rips of it right away

673
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,819
um but obviously like most of the other

674
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,500
stuff that I was growing wasn't

675
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:42,839
necessarily like little bunch of little

676
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,240
golf balls everywhere exactly yeah um

677
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,298
and so I I had to I had to take a

678
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,900
different tact into growing it I kind of

679
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:55,619
we kind of realized that like it didn't

680
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,298
yield very much unless you unless you um

681
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:58,759
either a grew it really close together

682
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:00,839
in high numbers

683
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,558
or B

684
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:03,839
um

685
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,158
you know topped it a bunch because it

686
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,379
was so dense

687
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,900
no matter how many branches it had it

688
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,720
would kind of throw off golf ball golf

689
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,038
ball golf ball golf ball golf ball so if

690
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,079
you figured out a way to get a bunch of

691
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,179
branches that got good light you'd get a

692
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:21,839
bunch of golf balls and that added up

693
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:25,259
yeah um it also seemed like uh it really

694
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,178
liked having an expansive root system

695
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:29,519
um I didn't realize that it wasn't

696
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,580
nearly as strong of a rooted plant as

697
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,220
other things uh in terms of watering so

698
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:37,678
like if you grew it if you grew at Hydro

699
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,058
you kind of like had uh

700
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,120
you know you almost wanted to grow it

701
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:43,440
like on a root mat yeah of that nature

702
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,479
so that like the roots would all

703
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,120
intertwine and grow out into one big

704
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,298
thing yeah or if you grew it in like a

705
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:54,239
fluffy uh you know uh peat moss perlite

706
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:56,220
or cocoa perlite bed yeah

707
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,419
um it really liked the roots growing out

708
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,819
wide

709
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,580
you know if you put it in a big pot by

710
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,259
itself of any kind of heavy soil or

711
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,480
something like that it didn't drink that

712
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:08,339
fast yeah so you ended up running into

713
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,319
issues where like it was difficult to

714
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:12,119
water it as frequently as you might want

715
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,778
and clone

716
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:18,058
difficult to slow you know and so I and

717
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:20,940
so that was so that was basically like

718
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:23,220
that was my introduction

719
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,200
um and you know uh our our buddy who

720
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,819
lives down south bitter you know it

721
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,100
turns out that

722
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,139
um I got it bro you know I got things

723
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:34,259
relatively early compared to a lot of

724
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,640
people oh yeah yeah you know but I

725
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:37,759
didn't have I didn't really at that

726
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,100
point in my life I really wasn't leaving

727
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,259
Mendo much you know or going much South

728
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,959
uh past the bay

729
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,900
so I just didn't realize that there was

730
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,819
this like massive boom going on down in

731
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,038
Southern California it took me a couple

732
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:55,918
of years to sort that out

733
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,720
um and it just so happens that uh the

734
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,759
way that ties into cookie

735
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,000
is

736
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,919
um that's the cut that

737
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,480
um all those guys were running

738
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,538
yeah

739
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,460
you know that's so cushion huh what what

740
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:13,859
did you notice in the differences

741
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,179
between triangle and the Flow Rider

742
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,918
because I you know people always say oh

743
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,240
it's just it's just a triangle cut when

744
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,299
they talk about it

745
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,359
it's definitely not

746
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:27,658
um I uh people might get mad at me for

747
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:29,459
saying this or whatever but I

748
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:32,100
um

749
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,519
I think the triangle might be like one

750
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:38,579
of the better all-around cushes yeah but

751
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,139
I don't think it's the best in like any

752
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:43,079
one area

753
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,120
okay if that makes sense like yeah it

754
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,339
does a pretty good job of yielding it's

755
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,699
got a pretty good Buzz

756
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:53,038
um it's it's it you know it has uh you

757
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,419
know uh good flavor and all that type of

758
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,538
stuff

759
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,759
um but it um

760
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:02,819
but it uh you know I don't think it has

761
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,220
like the nicest flavor uh or the nicest

762
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:06,599
high you know or anything like that I

763
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,339
think it's just like an all-around

764
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:10,019
winner now of course like that's

765
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:11,699
preference so like people might be like

766
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,798
oh dude you just don't know how to grow

767
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,720
it right or yeah you don't know this or

768
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,538
that or whatever but really

769
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,700
you know to be perfectly honest like you

770
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,740
know the the best tasting Kush I ever

771
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,980
tried you know

772
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,079
um yielded like [ __ ] yeah you know like

773
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,538
it was like a three quarters of a of a

774
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,658
of a pound of light yeah which I guess

775
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:35,158
when prices were crazy high made sense

776
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,360
for people

777
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,640
you know

778
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,699
um which cut was that

779
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,659
it was uh it was that master cut oh yeah

780
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,399
yeah yeah

781
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,740
you know but it don't you know it didn't

782
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,599
like it also it was dark it wasn't very

783
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,579
frosty

784
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,278
um you know it didn't look nearly as

785
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:55,619
nice as other ones

786
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,380
um you know type of thing so I didn't

787
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,959
really I didn't really realize like what

788
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,059
was going on as far as

789
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,919
um you know

790
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:06,599
so I don't I don't know I'm not gonna

791
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,820
sit here and say that I'm an expert on

792
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,558
like when exactly triangle Kush first

793
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:14,398
made it to California

794
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:17,879
sure but I you know

795
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:21,178
um I don't I didn't realize when

796
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,740
when you know like when I had FlowRider

797
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,240
it's kind of like the same thing that

798
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,538
with the sour

799
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,679
right was that I thought I had OG Kush

800
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:31,440
yeah

801
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:34,919
I didn't realize that there was this

802
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,720
mystery of like however many cuts that

803
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,460
came out of Florida and then a bunch of

804
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,220
s1s and then all these different things

805
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,038
like all that info that like is maybe

806
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,720
common to us now

807
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:49,140
I had no idea back then

808
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,659
yeah right so it was that was the one

809
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,000
that I ran for any number of years

810
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:57,120
yeah right and

811
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,159
you know I was told by that group that

812
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,619
it came

813
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,299
um direct from Florida to the Bay

814
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,099
yeah

815
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:07,740
and I didn't have any reason to to

816
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:10,500
disbelieve it at that point sure you

817
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:13,440
know and you know to be honest I mean I

818
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,179
now now that we know way more than we

819
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,159
did back then

820
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:21,019
like I you know I don't know what it is

821
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,520
yeah

822
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:25,980
I mean like you're pretty sure that it's

823
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,538
not triangle though and well the reason

824
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,720
the only reason why I'm pretty sure it's

825
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:33,179
not triangle is because years later I

826
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,480
wanted to see if it was yeah and

827
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,460
triangle because of Ricky has a

828
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,058
reasonably good like chain of of

829
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:44,278
provenance sure on it in terms of there

830
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:47,398
are people you can get it from

831
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,140
that can trace how they got it and

832
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,599
direct from Ricky bringing it to

833
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,960
California absolutely or even sending it

834
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,939
to California before he moved here yeah

835
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,259
right yeah

836
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,200
um so

837
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:03,538
you know so I grew it side by side yeah

838
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,058
with it and it's not the same thing is

839
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:08,220
it similar yes but I mean it's what's

840
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:09,960
funny is like when you were in that era

841
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,640
in Southern California when when

842
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,519
dispensaries would have like 25

843
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,120
different kinds of kush they were all

844
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,798
kind of like variations on the theme

845
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,418
yeah it's like splitting hairs it really

846
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:23,278
well I mean it's it's not you know

847
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,200
they're not always some of them are more

848
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,140
earthy some of them were a little bit

849
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,080
more lemony you know some I mean there

850
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,059
was variations amongst them I just don't

851
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,699
think that they were massive

852
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:38,220
I think a lot of it too was was people

853
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,899
growing in totally different methods and

854
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,278
that also becoming like oh this is a

855
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:43,859
different cut than yours let's compare

856
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,079
the pictures totally sure and so I think

857
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,519
that you know I definitely think you

858
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,038
know you could come up with differences

859
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,720
but it's kind of like you know when you

860
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:53,220
see like a batch of kids or something

861
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,558
that obviously came from the same

862
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,360
parents yes and their differences

863
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,678
they've got some different features it's

864
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,658
not like they're twins or anything like

865
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,899
that but they're definitely all peased

866
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:06,659
from the same pod yeah and so I've grown

867
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,879
a ton of kush

868
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:10,320
um both due to interest and due to the

869
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,659
fact that it was so popular in

870
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,639
California for so long

871
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,799
um you know but it get and eventually

872
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,899
for me it gets hard to like keep more

873
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,000
than two or three or four of them

874
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,739
because you sort of you sort of end up

875
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,880
picking the ones that you like for

876
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,859
whatever reason

877
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,480
you know if you're a breeder maybe you

878
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:30,479
pick the ones you feel pass on the

879
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,159
traits the right way yeah you know um if

880
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,099
you're a grower you probably pick the

881
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,960
ones that you're um that you're uh you

882
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:38,819
know your your broker or whatever is

883
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,259
happiest with

884
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:42,599
type of thing

885
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:45,599
you know all that and so but the main

886
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,519
thing with the Flowrider is that I got

887
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,959
it as OG

888
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,740
um it was supposedly direct from Florida

889
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,600
and the person that gave it to me is the

890
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,839
person that the The Thin Mint accident

891
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:00,658
happened in their room yeah and so it's

892
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,639
just it's just the the and you know and

893
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,919
that and I don't think that happened for

894
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:09,300
you know a good four plus years after I

895
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:12,179
got it yeah right like because so the

896
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,839
Flow Rider was like

897
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,000
was you know it just it just so happens

898
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:21,179
that it's it's the same cut

899
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,559
yeah that was in there you know now the

900
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,320
other thing is I don't know that I've

901
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,779
ever actually gotten a verified that I

902
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,760
could be that I could be totally you

903
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,440
know sure of

904
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,460
um I don't know that I've ever gotten

905
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,099
like the the first cut that came from

906
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,300
um Matt Bubba and Josh D that they

907
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,940
brought to LA

908
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,339
correct yeah you know so I can't compare

909
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,898
it to that one I do think that getting

910
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:47,699
verification on that cut would be damn

911
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:49,679
near impossible you know I mean if you

912
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,378
talked if you talk to Josh D or whatever

913
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,460
like he still has the same cut since 96.

914
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:55,799
yeah

915
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,380
um but because of the but because of the

916
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,260
the money and the rap and all that other

917
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,358
stuff do I believe it's alive I think

918
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,880
it's probably alive but like how would

919
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,880
you tell it from one of the three or

920
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,500
four sfv Cuts or how would you tell it

921
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,358
from this or how would you tell it from

922
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,460
the first goat like you know I mean

923
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:17,519
there's people that are like this 92 is

924
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,760
guaranteed it yeah and this ghost is

925
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,960
guaranteed it and this sfv is guaranteed

926
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,339
it

927
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,659
right and then you grow those three

928
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:27,119
things next to each other and they're

929
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,679
not the same plant yeah okay well let's

930
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,760
keep this more to the cookies thing do

931
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:31,858
you have an uh let's go into the

932
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,900
Thousand what you got

933
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:35,759
yeah so I guess not so it's a good

934
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,740
moment to bring you in as well so Matt

935
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,839
obviously has been also like doing a

936
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:41,578
little recap on the major components of

937
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,380
the family

938
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,140
um this is probably a good moment to

939
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,599
zoom out and talk about the problem at

940
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:52,199
large like going back to that crybaby

941
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:57,000
quote of uh it gets worse the further

942
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:59,338
down you go with cookies yeah um

943
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,780
boy what's your take on that because I

944
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:02,099
I've kind of given my take a little bit

945
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,200
but your take is going to be a different

946
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:06,420
and different perspective

947
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:07,199
what's your thoughts on that in general

948
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,240
um

949
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,460
you know what I think

950
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,819
what I think happened

951
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,519
basically is I mean if we wanted to

952
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,960
start at the end

953
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,320
you know

954
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,059
um some Bag seed fell out of some buds

955
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,440
that their people were rolling up into

956
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,500
making joints

957
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,059
and thin mint was found

958
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,219
right and it just so happens

959
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:38,338
that once that was found

960
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:41,338
okay uh in the bay

961
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:43,619
um out of some weed that came from Mendo

962
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:45,179
you know people's you know there's

963
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,440
people in that group that kind of

964
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,239
realized they might have had something

965
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,300
special

966
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,338
right and it was kind of like cookies

967
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,460
was sort of like in my opinion like the

968
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:58,858
birth of the modern weed scene yeah and

969
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,900
what I mean by that is that like it was

970
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:02,779
It was kind of around the time that IG

971
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,639
was really starting up

972
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,619
and so you couldn't smell you couldn't

973
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:10,440
taste you couldn't smoke but you could

974
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:11,760
see yeah and it was visually I mean

975
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,079
you'll remember Matt think about

976
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,540
remember how

977
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,640
stunning blueberry was when those

978
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,380
pictures were first posted on you know

979
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,078
on the forums probably 10 years before

980
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,640
that yeah you know um the only thing you

981
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,820
could see was visual

982
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,980
and Visually it was super appealing and

983
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,260
so you have a bunch of why do you think

984
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,420
the demarcation started with Instagram

985
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,859
and not at the Forum stage since both

986
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,599
were presenting pictures and you

987
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:38,519
couldn't smell it but it does I think

988
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,380
you're right like there is a clear

989
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:43,380
demarcation of when things changed

990
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,480
because IG came about when everybody had

991
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,880
started getting a smartphone in their

992
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,440
hand yeah it's a good point instead of

993
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,700
being a desktop

994
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,980
yeah

995
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:56,219
and probably the lack of long-form like

996
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,960
writing as well yeah yeah and you know

997
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:00,059
and a lot of those times there was

998
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,099
something you know the forums had

999
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,440
already sort of had their heyday

1000
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,838
and it's kind of like you had to like

1001
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,519
search them out and find them yeah type

1002
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:10,559
of thing I mean it's it's it's it's

1003
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:13,380
actually not that much different than

1004
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,279
you know some of the cookie stuff is

1005
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,940
like

1006
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,420
um

1007
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,980
it's also the first era where for

1008
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,260
decades

1009
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,940
um you know people hid their face and

1010
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,000
hid their involvement

1011
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:29,700
and all that and IG was sort of where

1012
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,400
people got famous by showing their face

1013
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:34,319
that's correct yeah that's very true it

1014
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
didn't happen a lot in the Forum and so

1015
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,740
there was a lot of that didn't really

1016
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,679
happen on a lot of the forums it's not

1017
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:44,459
like you saw Sam's man's face

1018
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:47,639
yeah it's not like you saw DJ's face

1019
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,139
you know or you know the or any any of

1020
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:50,519
the people that got you know kind of

1021
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:52,618
famous back then

1022
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:55,079
it was like you saw some weed pics maybe

1023
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:58,140
but you also because the way how wide

1024
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,880
the World Wide Web was back then

1025
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:02,879
you had to kind of it was a little bit

1026
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,160
more niche Niche do you think it had

1027
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,660
more to do also like coinciding with all

1028
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:09,480
the states going online and a bunch of

1029
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:12,299
new Growers sure I mean when when

1030
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,039
overgrow was going on

1031
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,900
um there was when it you know when it

1032
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,000
first started there was one there was

1033
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,000
one medical State yeah

1034
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,519
which was California yeah by the time IG

1035
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,880
was popping there was a there was it was

1036
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:29,338
the whole West Coast yeah and and times

1037
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,099
had changed and penalties had gone way

1038
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:33,900
down yeah and stuff like that you know I

1039
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,240
mean really what and this is this isn't

1040
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,338
a diss on him although we were making we

1041
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,979
were joking earlier but like

1042
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:43,559
you know every you know they they got

1043
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,300
burner because of his connections to

1044
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,279
hip-hop and stuff like that and various

1045
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:53,460
people he was hustling weed to to

1046
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:55,980
promote cookie yeah and he became cookie

1047
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,139
he did because because he was the face

1048
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,300
associated with

1049
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:02,338
you know now did he have did did he have

1050
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,320
anything to do with any of the accidents

1051
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:07,500
or any of the breeding involved before

1052
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,900
that no no but we had this received one

1053
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,119
through 300 or one through twenty one

1054
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,599
through eighty well we did about I think

1055
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,820
only like 15 strains uh 15 seeds on this

1056
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,240
funeral hunt and the number 20 was just

1057
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:23,940
popping when you plan so we do have that

1058
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,439
quote from him about breeding so look

1059
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,858
from the very beginning

1060
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,019
okay like and you can give and you can

1061
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:33,539
maybe give these guys great credit where

1062
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:35,699
you know there's a number of things that

1063
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:38,338
happen with cookie one

1064
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:41,098
you got to remember that at this point

1065
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:43,039
Southern California Los Angeles all that

1066
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,720
had become very famous and

1067
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,779
semi-synonymous with Kush absolutely

1068
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,759
right there is just like sports or

1069
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,700
whatever else like you know Giants

1070
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,560
Dodgers or whatever in baseball or you

1071
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:57,539
know there's Regional and especially

1072
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:01,559
City rivalries

1073
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:03,838
you know cookie was the first like you

1074
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:07,440
know cookie was was put the bay on the

1075
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:09,659
map yeah absolutely they did it was it

1076
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,579
was Bay Area it was found in the Bay

1077
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:13,679
Area the people promoting it were all

1078
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:16,619
from the bay it was something that

1079
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,480
everybody in the bay would you know uh

1080
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:21,300
could which you know goes kind of from

1081
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,740
San Jose to San Francisco to Oakland to

1082
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,019
you know it's kind of like a

1083
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:26,759
conglomerate of a bunch of little towns

1084
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:29,400
in a few cities

1085
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,300
they all could get behind it yeah

1086
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,980
yeah right and so a factor of like IG

1087
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,859
and it was extreme like because before

1088
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,480
before cookie you know looks weren't

1089
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:42,179
really all that important in weed as

1090
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,719
long as it worked yeah cookie really

1091
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:47,460
ushered in the looks are incredibly

1092
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:50,039
important

1093
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,240
and that person and that persists to

1094
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,460
this day

1095
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,219
you know and a lot of breeding post

1096
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,838
cookie became what was visually

1097
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:00,239
attractive

1098
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,739
and what people kind of found to be

1099
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,379
visually attractive was things that

1100
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:07,199
looked like cookies which is it was dead

1101
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:10,559
it was Frosty it looks like I mean

1102
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:12,480
what's funny is that if you look at it

1103
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,099
visually you know if you're like oh man

1104
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,440
it's code and the other part of it is if

1105
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:18,359
you have purplish buds or you have

1106
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,338
darker Buds and you have a bunch of

1107
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:24,239
Crystal on it

1108
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:27,000
it makes those that Crystal pop yeah

1109
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:29,699
right it makes it more visually you know

1110
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,039
and like really dense buds as you and I

1111
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:34,139
know often they don't have the same type

1112
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,179
of Crystal as like sour diesel yeah

1113
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:38,400
because they don't have as much surface

1114
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,559
area for all that Crystal to exist on

1115
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,358
with all the like you know I call it

1116
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,299
Hills and Valleys or whatever but with

1117
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:47,578
all the irregularly shaped yeah if you

1118
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,140
get a perfectly shaped rock hard nugget

1119
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,180
the whole thing looks like it's coated

1120
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:53,460
in Crystal it looks like it should be

1121
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:55,980
really dank yeah

1122
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,960
you know and then because there wasn't

1123
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,940
that much of it it was going for high

1124
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,579
dollar

1125
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,380
and then Berner gave it to Wiz Khalifa

1126
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,780
and he gave it to other hip-hop artists

1127
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,760
and they started rapping about it and

1128
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,400
they did a good job of making it a

1129
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,020
cultural thing yeah for sure and then

1130
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,639
they had a situation where they had the

1131
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:15,659
whole Bay behind them because the whole

1132
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,879
Bay

1133
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:20,519
had been desperate to like have I mean

1134
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,940
the bay was has always been a massive

1135
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:26,280
conglomerate of weed hustling

1136
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,318
yeah because it's sort of the end point

1137
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,640
for where almost all the weed from the

1138
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:34,858
triangle flowed down into by the 101.

1139
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:37,318
Humboldt Trinity Mendo Sonoma all that

1140
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:38,940
you get on the 101 and you go to the Bay

1141
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,739
right

1142
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,139
but this was the first thing that the

1143
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:46,139
bay could claim yeah

1144
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:49,019
and that made a big difference

1145
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:50,460
I think so I would imagine so you know

1146
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:53,219
and you couldn't smell it you couldn't

1147
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,838
smoke it you couldn't you know you

1148
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:56,399
couldn't see what was up with it but you

1149
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:59,219
could see it and Visually it looked

1150
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,599
incredible yeah and I think to this day

1151
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:07,618
a lot of people are still breeding for

1152
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,960
um for looks yeah I mean so yeah earlier

1153
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:12,180
Matt said not so that the first

1154
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,720
generation so to speak of cookies work

1155
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:19,019
wasn't wasn't the worst with respect to

1156
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:20,879
breeding but it does get seem to get

1157
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:23,039
worse quote unquote once you get to the

1158
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,940
later generations like the gelatos and

1159
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,920
runts what is your take on the that kind

1160
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,318
of like more recent

1161
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,260
part of cookies

1162
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:36,119
um gosh

1163
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,920
well I'll say this

1164
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,920
the people that made cookie famous

1165
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:48,420
were not the people that made cookie

1166
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,338
yeah right so the problem is is that you

1167
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,960
know the problem with cookie is that the

1168
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:54,420
people that ended up getting it and

1169
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,039
hyping it and making it work they

1170
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,260
essentially had

1171
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,719
a cut

1172
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,180
yeah they didn't have the parents they

1173
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:06,480
didn't have the grandparents cookie had

1174
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:08,338
been like a a conglomeration in my

1175
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,818
opinion of accidents that happened over

1176
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:15,059
probably a seven to ten year period

1177
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:17,818
yeah right and and you know that story

1178
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:20,219
is very common because you know you

1179
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:23,699
trace a lot of super famous weed back to

1180
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:26,219
its Origins and its bagseed

1181
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:28,919
yeah right

1182
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:30,299
and so whether that's sour diesel or

1183
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,940
whether that's kush or whether that's

1184
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,200
cookie or whatever there's bag seed and

1185
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,480
then there's different people at

1186
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:38,939
different times that had things that led

1187
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,858
to one thing led to another thing

1188
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,318
the thing that about cookie that made it

1189
00:45:40,858 --> 00:45:46,559
more difficult is that the people

1190
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:48,838
involved in my opinion did not want

1191
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,578
anyone going out there and remaking it

1192
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:52,920
better than what they had

1193
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:55,920
no yeah that's for damn sure it's money

1194
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,720
from from the very beginning they had no

1195
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,059
their interests

1196
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:02,098
were in using this line to get

1197
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:04,380
themselves loot make themselves famous

1198
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,300
and build a brand yeah

1199
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,480
yeah they weren't trying to do like

1200
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:12,000
constructive breeding per se well I I

1201
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,460
just meant in the sense that like they

1202
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,440
didn't want anyone else out there to

1203
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:19,079
recreate it

1204
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,780
better than they were yeah and they

1205
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:24,260
didn't want to give anyone credit before

1206
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,260
them

1207
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:30,300
who might have had a part in making it

1208
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:32,118
you see what I'm saying so you have a

1209
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,339
you have a loose collection of guys

1210
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:37,200
that's involved in different ways

1211
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:39,119
there's no contracts there's no

1212
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,019
organization everyone's trying to make

1213
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,619
it

1214
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:45,719
like this is their shot yeah

1215
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:46,559
right so

1216
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,199
um

1217
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,699
so the problem with cookie like I mean

1218
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,019
I've mentioned I can't remember maybe it

1219
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:53,759
was on

1220
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:56,460
I can't remember whose post it was on

1221
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,760
but I kind of view like

1222
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,858
um you know when animal cookies came out

1223
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,200
animal was kind of like they took thin

1224
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:06,598
mint and they threw it on Kush right

1225
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,460
yeah and it was cookie but it was cushy

1226
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,480
and it had some potency and all that

1227
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,420
right

1228
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,900
the problem that they faced is that they

1229
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,780
kept they tried to make a whole family

1230
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:21,660
based on one cut yeah and so they

1231
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,599
started inbreeding really strongly

1232
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:27,659
and I think what they did is they made

1233
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:29,338
mistakes in breeding early on

1234
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:31,098
because they were just learning about

1235
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:32,719
what they were up to

1236
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:35,760
right

1237
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,618
and they didn't know how to recover from

1238
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,079
those

1239
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:42,900
yeah it would have take knowing how to

1240
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,359
actually breed to recover that's that

1241
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,160
like my main thing was that yes people

1242
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,078
made crosses but breeding's a totally

1243
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:51,539
different thing well you also have to

1244
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,060
realize too that like

1245
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:57,179
at the same point in time that this was

1246
00:47:54,059 --> 00:48:00,119
all going on okay because there was a

1247
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:03,059
number of things with cookie that were

1248
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:05,039
you know or let's just say components of

1249
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:07,920
that we believe are in cookie over time

1250
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:11,880
yeah that just happened that were Herm

1251
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,880
accidents yeah and in that era before

1252
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,760
you know pre-cookie everything was still

1253
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,280
basically males and females

1254
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,200
yeah and her accidents

1255
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,740
and then when they started breeding with

1256
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:31,980
cookies right that's that was sort of

1257
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:34,318
the beginning of the reversal era yeah

1258
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,019
right I talked a bit about that in the

1259
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,759
beginning about how like during my era

1260
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:40,980
reversals were really looked down on but

1261
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,280
as we got into like the mid to late

1262
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:46,019
2000s even into like 2013-14

1263
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,359
because it was a bunch of new Growers

1264
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:51,480
and spray was available to buy it wasn't

1265
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:53,578
as like demonized as it was during our

1266
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,619
era so a lot of people were able to do

1267
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:58,859
that and not get the pushback that we

1268
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:01,140
got at the beginning if that makes sense

1269
00:48:58,858 --> 00:49:05,159
you know and and so they weren't really

1270
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:07,980
like really what they were doing is they

1271
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:09,299
had no interest in releasing accurate

1272
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,699
information

1273
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,140
yeah what they had interest in is

1274
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,399
releasing things that they were going to

1275
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:16,618
make a bunch of money

1276
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,780
off the pounds of it they were going to

1277
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:21,660
control who had it they were going to

1278
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,920
get kickbacks from who had it

1279
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:25,980
you know what I'm saying and they were

1280
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,300
going to build a brand based off of it

1281
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,440
you know

1282
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:33,480
um and and so that is very different

1283
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,300
from like our weed nerd of like oh well

1284
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,940
how exactly did it happen yeah exactly

1285
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:43,099
they had zero interest in being like oh

1286
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:45,780
well it you know it fell into our laps

1287
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:47,640
that doesn't sound as good right you

1288
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,040
know and then after it fell into our

1289
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:51,900
lapse we took the thin mint and we

1290
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,380
started doing a bunch of stuff with that

1291
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:57,920
one cut and they also had so many

1292
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,858
different menial types

1293
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,180
phenotypes well the other part of it too

1294
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:06,358
is that

1295
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:08,460
you know when we talk about they

1296
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:10,858
right

1297
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,318
um different people in the very small

1298
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:16,559
circle that they were in had different

1299
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:18,239
bits and pieces of information sure and

1300
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,858
they weren't exactly free to share it

1301
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,299
with each other either

1302
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:23,400
no I mean there's still competition

1303
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,380
going on because nobody wanted to get

1304
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,380
cut out yeah

1305
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,200
so it's not just like they were all it's

1306
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:34,200
almost like with a lot of those guys

1307
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:36,419
like the truth doesn't come out because

1308
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:37,618
it's more like a circular firing squad

1309
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,659
yeah

1310
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:41,160
yeah

1311
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:43,379
if somebody was still like up and out

1312
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:45,358
you know it doesn't matter what member

1313
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,720
and point fingers at that member and lay

1314
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:51,019
out exactly what they did and didn't do

1315
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:53,459
right that would might even be all true

1316
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:55,440
that person could point at them and

1317
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,960
release parts that they're not super

1318
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,818
enthused about other people knowing it's

1319
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,800
kind of like uh the mutually assured

1320
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:05,719
destruction that we saw when Dying Breed

1321
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,720
became terpogs from dying breed

1322
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,760
there was a lot of you know and and so I

1323
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,318
mean there's even a situation you know

1324
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,180
it's like where you know if I start

1325
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:16,920
mentioning names or whatever it's like

1326
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:20,519
and the hard part about discussing

1327
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,358
cookie to be frank is that

1328
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:25,019
um

1329
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:28,019
cooking now is uh is is a big clothing

1330
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:30,539
company and uh and a you know a

1331
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:33,960
multi-state an MSO a multi-state

1332
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:36,119
operator yes that is very intent on when

1333
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,720
we'd get goes fully federally legal

1334
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,760
getting bought out by somebody huge yeah

1335
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:43,980
and there's an enormous amount of money

1336
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,200
involved in cookie

1337
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:49,019
indeed you know and there's there's

1338
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:51,899
people in cookie you know that are that

1339
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:54,780
that are a pretty big part of like the

1340
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:57,000
formation of it but maybe aren't

1341
00:51:54,780 --> 00:52:00,119
represented nearly as well in terms of

1342
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,760
like stock position or whatever or you

1343
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,079
know within the company you know for

1344
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,660
sure like

1345
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,920
burner had nothing to do with any of it

1346
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:10,858
what but

1347
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,920
you know but they picked him

1348
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:16,139
to do what he's very good at it must

1349
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,079
have been his looks which is promote

1350
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:20,879
yeah yeah

1351
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:23,280
you can you can you can't I mean he's

1352
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,740
good at promoting things he is very good

1353
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,559
at promoting good at hyping things up he

1354
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:30,719
was good at getting the babe to be

1355
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,540
behind him because being behind him is

1356
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:36,058
being loyal to the Bay yes that's very

1357
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:37,739
true you know and then as a result of

1358
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,319
that there was other members in cookie

1359
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:41,759
that got angry whenever I mean I I used

1360
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,039
to have this running joke that people

1361
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,900
when they went to buy cookie you know

1362
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:47,519
they bought their eighth you know in the

1363
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,260
bay at like the dispensaries or whatever

1364
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:52,139
they thought that like it had been hand

1365
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:55,440
watered by burner yeah hand selected and

1366
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:56,818
watered and manicure they and you know

1367
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,440
and they actually even they actually

1368
00:52:56,818 --> 00:53:00,779
gave him the clothing company because

1369
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,539
they didn't want him to have the weed

1370
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:06,359
makes sense but then they got angry

1371
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:09,420
because a clothing company has way less

1372
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:12,299
issues as far as taxes or federal

1373
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,380
problems or anything like that and also

1374
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:17,640
really well with a bunch of money

1375
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:20,059
selling 150 sweatshirts yep and these

1376
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:24,779
other people are stuck running you know

1377
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:27,119
semi-gray area 215 era warehouses yeah

1378
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:30,000
yeah and they're making cash but it's

1379
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,019
not like you know it's it's not banked

1380
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,318
money

1381
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:36,599
like a clothing brand and then when the

1382
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:39,599
money came in you know when the

1383
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:42,539
investment Capital came in they wanted a

1384
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,300
front man to promote it yeah

1385
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:47,699
you know like everybody you know like

1386
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,960
every everybody sees burner all over

1387
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,879
cookie

1388
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,159
and that's intentional because you don't

1389
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,440
want to see the people behind cooking

1390
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:58,858
yeah because they're you they're just

1391
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,980
your normal old style I wouldn't even

1392
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:04,679
say normal or old I remember two of them

1393
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,000
were very young and and kind of good

1394
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:08,399
looking people but they just happened to

1395
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,239
work with the feds so they were put in

1396
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,940
the back

1397
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:14,058
yeah or or you know they were younger

1398
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,260
people that were related to

1399
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:19,260
those older people

1400
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:21,780
exactly you know and so as a result of

1401
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,079
that they had access to investment

1402
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,079
capital

1403
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,059
you know and so now it's all about like

1404
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,099
the problem with cookies when you talk

1405
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,900
about cooking there's there's multiple

1406
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,480
distinct things there's the cookie

1407
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,220
strain

1408
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,079
and sherb and all that which like is

1409
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:41,639
right in our wheelhouse of like weed

1410
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,818
history and all that other type of stuff

1411
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:46,980
but yeah cookie today has very little to

1412
00:54:44,818 --> 00:54:48,960
do with genetics

1413
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,838
that's the main point it's a clothing

1414
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,599
brand and it's a series of dispensaries

1415
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:57,358
yeah and as you well know this isn't any

1416
00:54:54,599 --> 00:55:00,059
secret now but almost all of their

1417
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:01,799
breeding is outsourced I still think

1418
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:04,559
that most people that watch this that

1419
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,960
are new do not know that part that

1420
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,300
cookies proper doesn't make seeds they

1421
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,858
have other places that make seeds White

1422
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,019
Label seeds that they release under

1423
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:15,900
cookies I mean let's put it this way

1424
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:18,539
because it makes their MSO situation a

1425
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,818
lot simpler yeah they don't even grow

1426
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:24,719
weed yeah that's a good point yeah

1427
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:27,539
that's the wild part they don't they

1428
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:31,318
they have contracts with third parties

1429
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:34,440
yeah where they provide the strains

1430
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:36,558
and in some cases and they have the

1431
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,760
right of first refusal

1432
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,400
they don't grow weed cookies doesn't

1433
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,920
have big indoors

1434
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,619
or greenhouses or outsides or whatever

1435
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,780
they contract with farmers

1436
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,039
right what they control is the clothing

1437
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,900
line

1438
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:55,858
the store

1439
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,660
and the mylars this is my Lark that's

1440
00:55:55,858 --> 00:55:59,338
right

1441
00:55:56,659 --> 00:56:01,019
that's how you you know like you know if

1442
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:02,460
it that's how I mean that's kind of how

1443
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:05,099
the runs people did it where it's like

1444
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,240
it's not official unless it's in their

1445
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:09,900
mylar

1446
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:13,318
yeah they control yep right and so

1447
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,460
touching weed makes your life a lot more

1448
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:16,739
complicated

1449
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,720
it does because that's the federally

1450
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:20,338
illegal part that's the sketchy part

1451
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:23,399
that's this having a clothing company

1452
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:26,159
and a dispensary where you're just

1453
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,318
you're not you know so

1454
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:29,578
you're brookering you're brokering

1455
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,380
basically yeah

1456
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:33,420
yeah um can I just interject here and

1457
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:38,099
say that I think this is a really good

1458
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:40,619
account of the social historical uh

1459
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:43,260
technological commercial conditions for

1460
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:46,140
the emergence of cookies but I kind of

1461
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:49,020
like to bring it back to the breeding

1462
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:52,019
side of things again and say

1463
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:54,780
uh another prompt from Crybaby was the

1464
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:57,420
importance of uniqueness in cannabis and

1465
00:56:54,780 --> 00:57:00,180
I think Matt you wanted to

1466
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:02,700
um raise no five Haze as a good counter

1467
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:04,558
example yeah so this is a perfect time

1468
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:06,899
for for NASA to delve into this a little

1469
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:11,400
bit more but um

1470
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:16,200
a counter example maybe of of a way of

1471
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:18,358
of a strain or a project that was a

1472
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,679
cross of a few things like cookies but

1473
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:21,239
when a completely different direction

1474
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,578
and why it went a different direction

1475
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:25,739
I'd say one of the best things the best

1476
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:28,740
examples for people to learn would be in

1477
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:30,479
all five Haze because it was a true F1

1478
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:32,818
hybrid

1479
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,460
um despite Haze being a couple of lines

1480
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:38,659
of different sativa types generally

1481
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:41,818
speaking what an F1 hybrid is is taking

1482
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:44,578
two distinctly different genotypes and

1483
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:47,099
Crossing them and in this case Haze and

1484
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:50,039
nl5 one being an Afghan one being a

1485
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:53,338
typically like uh equatorial sativa type

1486
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:55,318
Crossing those two brings a lot of of

1487
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:57,659
diversity and not only that we found

1488
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:01,079
that in a real F1 hybrids some of the

1489
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:03,239
most amazing gold is found you could

1490
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:05,039
talk about some of the the nl5 haze

1491
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:08,219
different cuts and and how they brought

1492
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,539
uniqueness versus what cookies is

1493
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:11,338
um

1494
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:13,318
Okay so

1495
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:17,099
I've said this before I think but I

1496
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:20,940
think that nl5 Haze is probably

1497
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:22,260
by far uh the most successful and

1498
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,599
impactful

1499
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,800
commercially available seed line that

1500
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:28,019
was ever created

1501
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,260
why didn't why did it not end up like

1502
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:30,259
cookies

1503
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,800
um well a number of reasons

1504
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:37,500
uh first

1505
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,900
you know Neville made the hybrid sure

1506
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,818
and so there's one person

1507
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:45,358
that made the hybrid

1508
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:47,338
and he had the parents for years

1509
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:50,159
it was cookie like like I said earlier

1510
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:53,460
cookie cookie was found in a bag seat

1511
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:56,279
yeah the people that popularized cookie

1512
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:59,220
didn't have the parents yeah

1513
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,280
right exactly and it was it was

1514
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:03,838
accidentally made rather than

1515
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,819
intentionally made yeah now the other

1516
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:08,338
thing about it now the other thing it's

1517
00:59:05,818 --> 00:59:10,858
also entirely possible I think it's

1518
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:13,858
likely although it can't be proven

1519
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:16,798
um I think thin mint itself was an S1

1520
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:18,358
okay okay where as you were mentioning

1521
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:23,219
before

1522
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:25,920
um nl5 Haze was an F1 yes of two vastly

1523
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:28,618
different genetics coming together

1524
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,500
okay and so this could this could also

1525
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:33,720
tie into something else which you know

1526
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,699
we we've talked about before but Bears

1527
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:39,358
repeating

1528
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:41,699
um nl5 Hayes was sort of a

1529
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,920
um because it was so wild

1530
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:45,779
yeah because it was it was two totally

1531
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,900
different things crossed together

1532
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:51,298
it had a really low floor and a really

1533
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:53,720
high ceiling yeah which meant that you

1534
00:59:51,298 --> 00:59:56,759
could find absolute junk

1535
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:59,219
all the way to I mean there's still

1536
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,500
probably eight or twelve cuts of nl5

1537
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:03,719
haze that are hoarded yeah that are 30

1538
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,280
plus years old yeah I don't think

1539
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:09,058
there's another line out there where

1540
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:12,420
there's as many living cuts

1541
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:14,400
that are that old that are still kept

1542
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:17,818
because of their value

1543
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,619
and a major a major part of that too in

1544
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:20,759
in why it differs from cookies because

1545
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:24,180
you know like we're talking about

1546
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,500
cookies you know uh gelato exists you

1547
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:27,598
know sherb exists all these little

1548
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,420
different nuances or takes on it even if

1549
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,818
they're hybrids but with the variation

1550
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,798
and the high floor low ceiling the nl5

1551
01:00:32,818 --> 01:00:37,199
haze had

1552
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:40,619
you were seeing variation in breeding

1553
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:42,838
again like you could take that nl5 Haze

1554
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:44,880
Direction one of those directions S1 it

1555
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:46,500
and still have tons of variants well

1556
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,500
maybe maybe we should maybe we should

1557
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:53,880
talk about this for a second so

1558
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:55,559
cookie came about by one bag seed and

1559
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,099
then a tiny group of people trying to

1560
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:00,980
control its rise yeah and not give

1561
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:03,539
people access to either the information

1562
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:06,000
or even the cut to do with what they

1563
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:08,159
wanted yeah that's for sure nl58 was

1564
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,099
totally different there was people in

1565
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:14,098
America that found an amazing nl5 Haze

1566
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:16,440
yeah okay like say in New York or South

1567
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:18,240
Florida or something and they wouldn't

1568
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,280
share it

1569
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,019
and so some of those people that they

1570
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,339
that they couldn't get it from those

1571
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:25,019
dudes

1572
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:26,578
they just went over to Amsterdam and

1573
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:29,338
they bought the exact same seed line

1574
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:31,260
from Neville yeah yeah there was a seven

1575
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:34,199
year period

1576
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:36,240
right imagine if cookie came out

1577
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:37,919
and for six or seven years after that

1578
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,598
you could go to the breeder where they'd

1579
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,880
found it in and bought the exact same

1580
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:45,420
seed line and Hunt yourself

1581
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,858
yeah we're not exactly sure when nl5

1582
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,280
died

1583
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:53,400
um or the the formula for nl5 haze

1584
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,440
um ended but it seems like it ended in

1585
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,079
somewhere in the the mid to late 90s

1586
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,940
yeah but that literally means that there

1587
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,519
was a seven or an eight year period

1588
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:04,500
where even if you couldn't get a hold of

1589
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:07,559
the cut itself because it was held on

1590
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,059
too tight you could go buy 100 or 200 to

1591
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:11,339
300 seeds

1592
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:15,119
of the exact same genetics and start

1593
01:02:11,338 --> 01:02:18,960
hunting it yourself yeah which is how

1594
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:21,180
all these phenos started happening

1595
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,579
because they weren't all bag seeds and

1596
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:25,259
f1s off one cut like happened with

1597
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:28,559
cookie

1598
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:30,720
right yeah they could go find full

1599
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:34,079
sisters

1600
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:36,959
and so there wasn't one small group that

1601
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:39,960
had control over it and was like lying

1602
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:42,240
about what the genetics were yeah you

1603
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:45,599
could literally go by the exact same

1604
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:47,759
genetics from the dude

1605
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,740
so I think that's a major difference in

1606
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,579
itself yeah right

1607
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:56,578
and then obviously if um

1608
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:59,818
if nl5 Haze is a full F1

1609
01:02:56,579 --> 01:03:01,798
with wide diversity in the line made by

1610
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:03,960
a male and a female

1611
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:05,219
like there's a lot more there's a lot as

1612
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,559
you were saying before there's a lot

1613
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:12,739
more directions you can take it

1614
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:12,740
yeah then a potential S1 bag seed

1615
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:22,380
yes it's a it's now not every bag seed

1616
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:25,079
that that created cookies was an S1 some

1617
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:27,420
of them were hybrids sure you know but

1618
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,579
it was just a vastly different it's

1619
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,079
almost like with cookie it's like you

1620
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:33,059
know there was an intentional breeding

1621
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:34,740
in the beginning and then a few years

1622
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:37,319
later something hermed onto something

1623
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:39,000
else and then that thing got grown for a

1624
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:40,679
few years and then that thing harmed

1625
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,380
onto something else and then that thing

1626
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:45,000
got grown for a few years and then that

1627
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,200
thing harmed and then they found thin

1628
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,019
men out of it

1629
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:53,039
yeah you know and so it's just it's just

1630
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:53,880
different and so as a result of that

1631
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:58,139
um

1632
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,519
you know uh cookie uh and then you know

1633
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:03,298
beyond that

1634
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:05,039
I mean even after like nl5 Hayes stopped

1635
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,719
being a thing for a second in the sense

1636
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,619
that you couldn't get the exact seed

1637
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:09,659
line

1638
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:12,298
within a few years of that happening

1639
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:15,118
mango Haze and Neville's Haze and Super

1640
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:18,298
Silver Haze all came out and that

1641
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:21,660
dominated the scene again and still to

1642
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:24,298
this day like super silver haze Jack via

1643
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:26,759
Amnesia Haze dominate that scene to this

1644
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:29,280
day almost like cookies did over here

1645
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:33,480
and they have like literally kind of

1646
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:35,880
bred Amnesia in the same directions like

1647
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,679
certainly Amnesia is amnesia no matter

1648
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,539
what you cross to it so you know you

1649
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,460
start looking at you start looking at

1650
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:43,199
sherb or you start looking at gelato or

1651
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,900
you start looking at

1652
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:48,598
and all this different stuff and at some

1653
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:52,380
point in all of that they re-cross it

1654
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:57,359
directly back to the same cut yes most

1655
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:58,680
cookie breeding involves one cut yes

1656
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:00,779
doesn't mean they might not have

1657
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:03,000
outcrossed it but once they outcross it

1658
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,760
into something they typically hit it

1659
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,858
back again or the outcross is usually

1660
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,619
already a component of what they were

1661
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:13,259
crossing it sells so what happened with

1662
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:16,440
with you know with cookie or like let's

1663
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:18,540
let's put it this way Neville because he

1664
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,639
had the both parents and was able to

1665
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:23,039
make a massive amount of seeds

1666
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,719
he was able to take the line in all

1667
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,239
kinds of different directions

1668
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:30,779
cross it to different things and make

1669
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:33,179
completely new lines out of it

1670
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:36,359
right that had their own thing where

1671
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:39,480
cookie all all started from basically

1672
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:41,639
like one bag seat

1673
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:44,039
yeah and so their their method was

1674
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:46,078
crossing things back to that same thing

1675
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:48,179
because it was popular and they wanted

1676
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,920
to reiterate it over well they also they

1677
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:53,578
also came into it in different way like

1678
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:57,019
they never had the parents

1679
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:57,019
they didn't have the parents

1680
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,960
it might be a good point for me to ask

1681
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,880
and it's kind of like uh

1682
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,280
it's kind of a slightly different take

1683
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,619
but I'd like to hear from both of you

1684
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,420
were there any positives to come out of

1685
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:11,220
cookies like from any part of it like

1686
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:14,579
what what do we get

1687
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:16,858
in terms of like lessons or

1688
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:20,400
Expressions that are still you know

1689
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:23,578
useful and could be worked with uh well

1690
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,740
I mean I might have a different take on

1691
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:27,119
this than me go ahead yeah you give or

1692
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:28,798
take

1693
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,039
um cookies made

1694
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:35,239
in the weed world at least

1695
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:38,099

weed world I'm wealthy most of the time

1703
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,720
if you mention those people to anybody

1704
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:56,339
with a decent knowledge of of modern

1705

weed history they know who you're

1706
01:06:56,338 --> 01:07:03,719
talking about yeah um cookies cookies

1707
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:07,500
started and it's probably it you know

1708
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:10,259
turn it that one cut led to one of the

1709
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,298
largest current brands

1710
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,799

States what are you going to say a

1712
01:07:13,798 --> 01:07:17,280
thousand

1713
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:19,558
oh this is going to say so yeah it's

1714
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,740
obviously benefited the individuals

1715
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:23,880
involved yes but uh all the individuals

1716
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:26,459
involved

1717
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,900
cookies has a brand

1718
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,599
um you know I won't say his real name

1719
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:33,119
but um

1720
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:35,700
sherbinsky has an entire brand yeah um

1721
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:38,940
it's basically made their careers yeah

1722
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:41,719
right and since that came out

1723
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:43,920
they've made an enormous amount of money

1724
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:47,279
marketing clothing

1725
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,880
marketing you know basic hybrids and

1726
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,640
then on top of that because cookie

1727
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,640
got so famous and the look became so

1728
01:07:53,639 --> 01:08:00,139
popular Matt can speak to this a bit

1729
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:02,699
an enormous amount of new breeders

1730
01:08:00,139 --> 01:08:05,818
decided I'm gonna try to make my own

1731
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:07,379
variation on this thing yeah and so for

1732
01:08:05,818 --> 01:08:10,259
the next decade

1733
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:13,680
at least for I would say from 2010 to

1734
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:18,000
2020 easily and maybe even a little bit

1735
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:20,399
more the most common hybrid in cannabis

1736
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,039
is

1737
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,358
cookie some kind of cookie crossed to

1738
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:28,679
some kind of kush

1739
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:30,620
yeah so is it charitable take framing of

1740
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:32,520
what you just said that cookies

1741
01:08:30,619 --> 01:08:35,039
encouraged a whole bunch of people to

1742
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:38,460
get into making seeds

1743
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:42,238
no I don't think that's true

1744
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:44,880
um well because you know so what I think

1745
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,879
what I think happened there and this

1746
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,100
might be a little bit of a tangent but

1747
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,400
um you know it used to be very very

1748
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:57,719
difficult to be an American Seed breeder

1749
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:59,579
and have a market yeah most people

1750
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:01,859
um like say take DNA or somebody like

1751
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:04,318
that Americans who wanted to start a

1752
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:05,880
seed company they literally up they got

1753
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,179
a bunch of stuff from America and they

1754
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,859
moved to Amsterdam yeah Matt to throw

1755
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:14,640
people off his Trail

1756
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:16,199
uh wasn't your first website dot NL yeah

1757
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,560
I wanted people to think I was a Dutch

1758
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:25,198
company just in case so

1759
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:27,000
IG not only did IG explode you know uh

1760
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:30,059
cookie in the sense that like because it

1761
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,880
was so visually appealing it also gave a

1762
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,380
lot of small breeders a way to access

1763
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,920
customers

1764
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:40,440
a way to promote their seeds away for a

1765
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,600
bunch of small hobbyists with garages to

1766
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:45,358
create a seed company and then Market

1767
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:49,620
those seeds and then because in the in

1768
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:52,140
the in the 2010s and on 215

1769
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:54,179
and all these medical places had

1770
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:58,280
happened so much

1771
01:09:54,179 --> 01:10:02,520
there was this huge cup era

1772
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:05,579
okay of High Time starting to throw lots

1773
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:08,280
of cups in California monthly cups

1774
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:10,800
monthly cups in California in Colorado

1775
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:13,319
and all these different places so then

1776
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,779
all of a sudden you had a situation

1777
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:18,359
where a lot of these small breeders not

1778
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:21,300
only could promote themselves on IG

1779
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:23,158
but they could buy a booth at one of

1780
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,159
these cups and it would almost be like a

1781
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:28,019
flea market gray area swap meet where

1782
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,000
they could get in front of customers and

1783
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,320
start selling their package seeds to

1784
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,479
people

1785
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:37,139
I mean Matt and I joke that probably

1786
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:40,379
like 95 of today's breeders came up in

1787
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:42,780
that environment sure and so what are

1788
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:45,179
you doing I wouldn't say 95 I would say

1789
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:47,099
five percent 95 came up in the

1790
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:49,100
environment of IG that's what I mean

1791
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:54,000
yeah like 95

1792
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:55,679
of new breeders you know like were you

1793
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,479
know maybe five percent was old

1794
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,158
schoolers deciding they finally could

1795
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:01,500
like do it a little bit more publicly

1796
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:03,539
and not just give it to friends yeah and

1797
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:07,198
95 of them were people that were like

1798
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:09,479
man I can I can get on IG I have 5 000

1799
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:12,119
followers I have 10 000 followers I can

1800
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:13,559
announce a drop yeah I have a way to

1801
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:15,899
communicate with them I have a way to

1802
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:19,980
stay a little bit Anonymous I can also

1803
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:20,819
get booths and go sell them directly and

1804
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:23,879
so

1805
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:27,299
part of Cookie's popularity was because

1806
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,699
since cookie was the most popular thing

1807
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:31,920
when this was all going on

1808
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:36,000
the easiest thing for these new breeders

1809
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:38,940
to do was to use cookie in their hybrids

1810
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,738
yeah to gain popularity so it almost

1811
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:43,079
went hand in hand

1812
01:11:40,738 --> 01:11:45,899
yeah I can see that you know like if it

1813
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:49,619
had happened 10 years before it would

1814
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:51,479
have been Kush and Diesel

1815
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:53,939
yeah it's really interesting um

1816
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:56,039
intersection I mean what about you man

1817
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:58,259
like what do you see as possible

1818
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:59,640
positives coming out of

1819
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,840
cookies

1820
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,300
so

1821
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,579
I think like one of the biggest lessons

1822
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:07,619
we have with cookies like the positive I

1823
01:12:05,579 --> 01:12:10,679
would take from it is learning that

1824
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:13,920
there is a way where

1825
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:17,100
at first it was learning a whole new

1826
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:20,279
method of advertising for for people who

1827
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:22,380
sold seeds we had to learn to adapt in a

1828
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:24,359
whole new environment in the first place

1829
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:27,480
so that in itself is a good thing

1830
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:29,219
because you know in a long in a business

1831
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:31,079
that lasts a long time you always have

1832
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:33,179
to recreate yourself in some way shape

1833
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:35,399
or form to keep people interested and to

1834
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:38,039
keep your own interest right

1835
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:39,839
um cookies taught me a lot about how the

1836
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:42,779
market works and how the market works

1837
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,699
when a lot of money is thrown into an

1838
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:45,779
industry where there was not a ton of

1839
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:47,519
money especially coming from the

1840
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:49,380
American side in the Sea World there

1841
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,600
wasn't a lot of money put into marketing

1842
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,400
so we learned how that works and we also

1843
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,280
learned how it works when you take a

1844
01:12:53,399 --> 01:13:00,359
specific line that is fairly new and run

1845
01:12:56,279 --> 01:13:02,399
it into the ground 90 Ways to Sunday and

1846
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:05,698
where that kind of takes the whole

1847
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:08,099
market and that people can be convinced

1848
01:13:05,698 --> 01:13:10,439
that something is new and different even

1849
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,840
though it looks exactly the same as the

1850
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:13,859
last thing that was shown now I don't

1851
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,260
know if that's necessarily for the

1852
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:19,198
better or worse but any new data points

1853
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:22,079
in my mind are good even if they are

1854
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:24,299
null data points or bad like negative

1855
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:27,198
data points where it's like it impacts

1856
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,199
the scene negatively

1857
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:33,359
I could make a point to that too where I

1858
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:35,579
could say that um

1859
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:37,279
I would say in the previous era to

1860
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:38,939
cookie

1861
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:42,439
mostly

1862
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:44,059
what drove popularity to a large degree

1863
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:48,479
was

1864
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:50,039
potency taste and scent

1865
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,500
you know

1866
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,779
um you know especially like the sour era

1867
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,279
sour could look kind of funky and ugly

1868
01:13:54,779 --> 01:13:58,259
and sticky you know it could have a lot

1869
01:13:56,279 --> 01:14:01,380
of stick you know a lot of stent could

1870
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:04,140
be stemi uh all that and people would

1871
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:06,119
crack open the bag and get a whiff of

1872
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:09,000
that nose and look up and say this will

1873
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:09,599
work yep right

1874
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,198
um

1875
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:16,320
you know Kush became popular because it

1876
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:19,439
was very potent yeah it had a

1877
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:22,019
distinctive gassy type nose

1878
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:24,299
that you could sort of roll around in

1879
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:25,679
your mouth after you hit it right

1880
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,600
a lot of people when they first

1881
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,760
experience Kush

1882
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,260
and they'd smoke it a little and then

1883
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,820
they'd be they'd realize that the

1884
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,520
aftertaste they could sort of like roll

1885
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:38,460
around on their tongue yeah and it was

1886
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,620
very potent and it was it got you it got

1887
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:42,539
you more stoned than a lot of the stuff

1888
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:46,380
that was around it at the time it was

1889
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:49,319
very cerebral High you know narcotic and

1890
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:52,079
so what cookies did

1891
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:54,299
um is cookies which in my opinion still

1892
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:58,979
holds today

1893
01:14:54,300 --> 01:15:01,079
um today it's it's about uh testing and

1894
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:03,839
looks yeah

1895
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:07,140
those are the top two primary

1896
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:10,319
considerations for breeding you know

1897
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:13,980
if you compare it to the Barbie era for

1898
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:16,380
women during a certain era women kind of

1899
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:18,539
changed the way that beauty looked from

1900
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:20,520
the era in the 60s when Barbie or 50s

1901
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:21,899
when Barbie popped up women were

1902
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,940
expected to kind of have this kind of

1903
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:26,579
figure in form and people got used to

1904
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:28,738
seeing this as what beauty is right and

1905
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:31,140
I think this kind of impacted what weed

1906
01:15:28,738 --> 01:15:33,359
became in that cookies had a very

1907
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:35,640
specific look and this became what was

1908
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:38,099
beautiful in cannabis which didn't

1909
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:40,079
necessarily represent the high or any of

1910
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,120
those other things but image is what was

1911
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,600
important just like with the Barbie era

1912
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:48,658
and what we ended up was this is what

1913
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,100
most people's concept of beauty is in

1914
01:15:48,658 --> 01:15:51,319
weed and what they expect it to look

1915
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,300
like purple

1916
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:56,579
extremely resonance like lots of resin

1917
01:15:54,300 --> 01:16:00,060
glands and stocks

1918
01:15:56,579 --> 01:16:01,760
and you know dense dense purple nuggetry

1919
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,900
you know like yeah

1920
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,219
and that's what yes well and bracks and

1921
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:07,859
that's what people expect out of beauty

1922
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:10,140
of cannabis it's it's defined it in a

1923
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:12,299
way that it's very hard to change the

1924
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:14,100
Market's idea of what real beauty is in

1925
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:17,159
cannabis in the high

1926
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:20,280
I mean the other part of it too is that

1927
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:21,179
you know it also sort of like brought

1928
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:24,079
along

1929
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:26,460
a little bit of the Primacy of indoor

1930
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:29,158
because most of the cookie stuff was

1931
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:32,279
being grown in indoor grows in

1932
01:16:29,158 --> 01:16:34,259
warehouses in the bay yeah and people

1933
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:36,300
would try to take it and like put it

1934
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:39,600
outside or put it in depth or put it in

1935
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:41,400
full sun and it grew like crap yeah

1936
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,380
you know but for someone that was

1937
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:46,738
growing a bunch of two foot tall plants

1938
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:49,079
on rockwool yeah you know it worked and

1939
01:16:46,738 --> 01:16:51,539
so I think what happened is is that

1940
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:54,359
because those people were interested in

1941
01:16:51,539 --> 01:16:57,899
in branding and marketing and all that

1942
01:16:54,359 --> 01:17:01,559
they were perfectly fine with the look

1943
01:16:57,899 --> 01:17:03,899
like outpacing the effect oh yeah and

1944
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,760
once they lost the effect they didn't

1945
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:08,579
really have the skill set because that's

1946
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:11,100
not who they were to find it again like

1947
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:13,439
there's there was a potential if things

1948
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:14,940
had gone a slightly different way where

1949
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:17,698
they probably they might have been able

1950
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:18,799
to like marry that look with a good

1951
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:22,379
effect

1952
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:24,179
but they just lost it early on they lost

1953
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,920
the effect of OG Kush which was the best

1954
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:26,940
you know and they so they lost that

1955
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,060
effect

1956
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:32,460
the look was easy to find but once you

1957
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,920
know as anybody knows if you start

1958
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:36,239
picking your winners based on testing

1959
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,579
and looks

1960
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:41,819
you'll quickly get to like a very kind

1961
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:43,738
of bland Bud yeah

1962
01:17:41,819 --> 01:17:46,799
so this is this is a good moment I think

1963
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:49,439
to to say um in the last in the first

1964
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,820
cookies episode that YouTube did

1965
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:54,359
um you had a little thought experiment

1966
01:17:50,819 --> 01:17:56,519
that was what can you do with cookies as

1967
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:59,399
a hypothetical breeding project right

1968
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:02,520
and I think what would be cool for now

1969
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:07,379
um for today's episode is how would you

1970
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:08,280
what a possible reconstructions of it

1971
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,900
um

1972
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:11,939
they all have very different opinions

1973
01:18:09,899 --> 01:18:14,698
than Matt so Matt can go first

1974
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:18,059
okay so if I was going to be be

1975
01:18:14,698 --> 01:18:20,039
reworking something very purple

1976
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:23,159
with lots of

1977
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:25,140
stocks that had oil filled heads which

1978
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:26,639
to me is super important and a lot of

1979
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:29,579
people don't realize that in the cookie

1980
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:31,860
stuff like it's a lot of of stocks but

1981
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:33,600
not a lot of oil in the in the heads

1982
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:35,519
which is why you don't get super terpy

1983
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,860
cookie stuff in my opinion like you just

1984
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,120
don't so I would choose something that

1985
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:43,039
would be purple

1986
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:46,738
and I mean as a man that loves purple

1987
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:49,679
myself I lean towards a potent blueberry

1988
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:52,859
if I were going to go this direction I

1989
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:56,340
would want to terpy a good Afghani blue

1990
01:18:52,859 --> 01:18:58,979
type to to take that over and maybe

1991
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:02,039
maybe uh even in the direction of let's

1992
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:03,779
say a Bubba blueberry would even be a

1993
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:05,039
better direction for me and something

1994
01:19:03,779 --> 01:19:06,719
that I could take it 100 different

1995
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:08,819
directions keep breeding it and

1996
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,380
outcrossing it and not have the inbred

1997
01:19:08,819 --> 01:19:12,420
nature even though blueberry does have

1998
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,739
some inbred nature to it I would use

1999
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,960
blue bonnet because I already know that

2000
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:19,319
doesn't and kind of cheat that way and

2001
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:21,600
go up and make a uh a very dense potent

2002
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:23,579
purple plant with tons of turfs that's

2003
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,440
how I'd redo it I mean I knew you were

2004
01:19:23,579 --> 01:19:27,059
going to say that and so I'm gonna ask

2005
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,178
you what if you had to do it without the

2006
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:33,800
blue oh Jesus so

2007
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:33,800
I would probably go

2008
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:41,399
oh I would go deep chunk I would take it

2009
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:43,020
to the Deep chunk route look at myself I

2010
01:19:41,399 --> 01:19:45,599
know because deep chunk deep chunk is

2011
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:47,219
not terpy and it's notoriously dominant

2012
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,500
in what you cross it to

2013
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:52,020
but I've also crossed into things that

2014
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:54,238
it is dominated by and only passes its

2015
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:58,260
resin production with with those glands

2016
01:19:54,238 --> 01:20:00,178
so I would go deep chunk cross to Tom

2017
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:01,800
Hill says

2018
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:03,539
because I've actually seen it done and

2019
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,079
it looks like cookies and it's kind of

2020
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:08,819
another cheat nice that entire last

2021
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:10,679
minute might have just been to just to

2022
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:12,920
make Tom mad at him so we'll see what

2023
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,920
happens

2024
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:20,219
yeah what Tom's work needs is is to turn

2025
01:20:18,658 --> 01:20:21,479
it permanently purple that's what he

2026
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:22,980
wants that's what he said that's what he

2027
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:24,839
that's what he's after is this beautiful

2028
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:26,819
his whole career if he could just take

2029
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,619
his life work and make it purple for him

2030
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:32,158
he would just negative fall over and die

2031
01:20:28,619 --> 01:20:34,738
yep I I would say I mean I'll have a

2032
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,719
two-part thing to it one

2033
01:20:34,738 --> 01:20:38,399
is that because I come from a very

2034
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:41,100
different world than that

2035
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:45,599
uh in the in the 90s

2036
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:50,100
we would have we would have loved cookie

2037
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:52,860
okay because when you're growing gorilla

2038
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,900
and you're growing shade grown weed

2039
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:56,819
that doesn't get full sun and you're

2040
01:20:54,899 --> 01:20:59,879
hiding it in manzanita's and stuff like

2041
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:02,039
that a strain that gets dense

2042
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:04,319
a strain that doesn't need very much

2043
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:06,060
light to get dense

2044
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:09,119
um cookies is kind of famous for like

2045
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:11,219
not liking sun and not liking food yeah

2046
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:13,619
right so

2047
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:16,920
it would it would like a cookie type

2048
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:20,939
line would be amazing if we ever had to

2049
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:22,800
go back to the manzanitas because it

2050
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:26,039
would yield really well

2051
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,659
it likes being shade grown yeah I mean

2052
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:30,179
there was people that got cookies early

2053
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:32,219
on that used to like grow tables of

2054
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:34,079
something else and then on the outskirts

2055
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:35,579
of that table where there was only

2056
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,279
partial light they would load it down

2057
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:39,779
with cookies yeah because it would still

2058
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:42,179
yield really well

2059
01:21:39,779 --> 01:21:44,340
and they started getting amazing yields

2060
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:47,940
per light because cookies could kind of

2061
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:49,560
grow in half shade yeah so make sense a

2062
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:52,500
strain that would do really well like

2063
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,539
that and stay short and and dense up and

2064
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:58,020
look really pretty that you could grow

2065
01:21:54,539 --> 01:22:00,238
like in not ideal conditions

2066
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:02,940
we would have loved back then

2067
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:04,678
as far as like where what you could do

2068
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:07,079
with it now

2069
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:10,800
how would you recreate it no recreate

2070
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:13,500
what would be the not not so cookies

2071
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:16,800
what would be the not so cookies yeah

2072
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:19,560
how would you make a purple dense well I

2073
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,000
mean that could be maybe giving up some

2074
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,280
of the

2075
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,840
some of the secret sauce or whatever of

2076
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:26,759
what was in it

2077
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,199
um but I think if you were going to

2078
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,820
remake it

2079
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:33,238
you know

2080
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:35,179
um the the idea would be to try to keep

2081
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:38,158
it somewhat wide

2082
01:22:35,179 --> 01:22:41,119
right so you know I mean

2083
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:44,099
you know you add cushion

2084
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:46,859
right so you'd add some type of kush

2085
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:49,020
I would try to go with one of the ones

2086
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:51,799
that we think of as like an original

2087
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,940
Kush like the Flow Rider or the TK or

2088
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,619
you know if you could figure out which

2089
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:57,000
one was the actual one that Josh D

2090
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:58,979
brought out just because it wouldn't be

2091
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:03,179
necessarily an S1 it would be a hybrid

2092
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:06,000
sure right so for instance to expand on

2093
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:09,719
that for a second a lot of people when

2094
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,359
they s one'd a lot of kush cuts

2095
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:14,640
the Kush cuts that ended up being nice

2096
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:17,219
in those s1s kind of looked exactly like

2097
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:20,699
the mother cut yeah because those cuts

2098
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:22,140
were already bag seats and then

2099
01:23:20,698 --> 01:23:25,139
when you

2100
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:27,600
reverse like one of the hybrids say like

2101
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:29,280
the T like What CSI did with the TK

2102
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,980
right

2103
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:34,380
um all of a sudden you get a y a much

2104
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:37,678
wider variety of phenotypes that pop out

2105
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:40,560
of it yeah right it's not just it the

2106
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:43,500
good ones look exactly like the mom yeah

2107
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:46,199
right and so I guess what I'm saying in

2108
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:49,020
a long-winded way is I would try to

2109
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:50,639
create create it without bottlenecking

2110
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:52,260
it

2111
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,360
because I think that's what ended up

2112
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,860
happening to it is it got bottlenecked

2113
01:23:54,359 --> 01:23:57,420
way too early

2114
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:59,819
that's cheating yeah what would you

2115
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:02,520
recreate it with with without using the

2116
01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:04,559
same components but it's hard because I

2117
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,480
mean you said you said it's hard you you

2118
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:10,020
know you mentioned that you might cross

2119
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:12,419
it like you know I I can see why you use

2120
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:14,460
deep chunk take an adventure because

2121
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:17,460
you're trying to figure something short

2122
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:19,439
and dense that isn't Kush and isn't bad

2123
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:21,119
I almost went purple number one and

2124
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:24,539
really [ __ ] it up so

2125
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:27,539
you know I mean and then you know you

2126
01:24:24,539 --> 01:24:29,640
have a situation where like you know I

2127
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:32,219
mean it it kind of has

2128
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:34,320
it has some you know how do you remake

2129
01:24:32,219 --> 01:24:35,939
it without using Kush without using any

2130
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,979
of like the purple strains that were

2131
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:39,539
famous you don't even have to make it

2132
01:24:37,979 --> 01:24:41,039
smell the same but something that would

2133
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:42,300
actually it doesn't even necessarily

2134
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:43,439
have to smell taste or at the same

2135
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,860
height because that's not what people

2136
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:48,359
even judge cookies on anyways an imagery

2137
01:24:46,859 --> 01:24:49,679
how would you make something appear the

2138
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:51,479
same what what route would you take

2139
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,579
without using the same components

2140
01:24:51,479 --> 01:24:55,319
without using the same component I could

2141
01:24:53,579 --> 01:24:56,880
hit you upside the head with an obvious

2142
01:24:55,319 --> 01:24:58,559
purple right now you could use it's a

2143
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,079
purple afghan

2144
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,780
I mean

2145
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:06,238
the thing about it is is that

2146
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:08,099
is you know if you wanted to look the

2147
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:09,649
way that it looks

2148
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:12,710
you know I mean

2149
01:25:09,649 --> 01:25:12,710
[Applause]

2150
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,279
everything I think of I'm like oh it's

2151
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:19,259
kind of related to it in some way well

2152
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:22,439
no not not just

2153
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:24,060
not necessarily because like assume that

2154
01:25:22,439 --> 01:25:28,339
it is made with what they say it's made

2155
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:28,340
with just Urkel and GDP and all that

2156
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,359
you know

2157
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,360
um

2158
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:37,919
you know we there's actually

2159
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:40,020
I think I'm

2160
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,719
I think I had something to say and then

2161
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:45,239
it got like

2162
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:47,279
huh we broke the robot we broke it we

2163
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:51,000
broke the robot I mean so I was thinking

2164
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:53,759
you'd go Mendo perps cross to the Maui

2165
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,679
or something like that well

2166
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:59,159
that

2167
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:00,779
but the problem is is that uh at least

2168
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:02,219
when it comes to certain certain

2169
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:03,840
branches of the family I think that

2170
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:06,060
that's in there already

2171
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,139
yeah but we haven't talked about that at

2172
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,260
all we weren't going to talk about it so

2173
01:26:07,139 --> 01:26:12,480
I think you know because the problem is

2174
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:14,699
see the the biggest issue with cookie is

2175
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,559
that because everybody tries to muddy

2176
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:18,779
the waters on what's in it

2177
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,820
it's very difficult to get a straight

2178
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:22,198
answer out of any of them even if you've

2179
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:24,840
known some of them a really long time

2180
01:26:22,198 --> 01:26:26,759
sure right and what they're going to do

2181
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,800
is if you if you start talking

2182
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,800
definitively about what you think is in

2183
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:35,039
there they're going to jump on the parts

2184
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:37,139
that they that might be a little bit off

2185
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:39,119
that they disagree with obviously that

2186
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:41,760
they disagree with and then use that to

2187
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:43,738
discredit the whole thing you know and

2188
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,800
part of the reason why Matt's tried to

2189
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:48,779
get me to talk about cookie a lot and I

2190
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,699
have been hesitant to

2191
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:52,139
um simply because

2192
01:26:50,698 --> 01:26:54,299
um you know like I said there's a branch

2193
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:56,219
of cookie that wants to be a

2194
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:58,860
multi-billion dollar corporation that

2195
01:26:56,219 --> 01:27:01,439
gets gobbled up by somebody huge and all

2196
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:03,479
these people get payouts

2197
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:05,460
so it's really difficult to discuss

2198
01:27:03,479 --> 01:27:09,178
cookie

2199
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:12,420
right because there's that element to it

2200
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:14,158
sure it's not just you're not just gonna

2201
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,899
like anger

2202
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:17,579
a few people

2203
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:19,738
no and I mean I think this whole episode

2204
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:22,559
is going to be that and as Matt and is

2205
01:27:19,738 --> 01:27:25,619
Matt well knows you know even even on

2206
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:27,600
small people or like you know when I say

2207
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:30,119
small I mean like not smaller compared

2208
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,980
to like the cookie monolith or whatever

2209
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:34,079
if Matt Matt's you know a lot of the

2210
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:38,158
reason why Matt gets black in public is

2211
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:41,460
because he outs somebody's truth and

2212
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:43,619
then they feel like that

2213
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:46,679
well it might be true it's also

2214
01:27:43,619 --> 01:27:48,599
affecting their pocketbook sure so the

2215
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:50,460
the way that it doesn't affect their

2216
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,980
pocketbook is by making everybody know

2217
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:54,119
that Matt Ryan is a total scumbag and

2218
01:27:52,979 --> 01:27:55,879
you shouldn't believe anything that

2219
01:27:54,119 --> 01:27:59,420
comes out of his mouth

2220
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:03,420
we have to discredit the messenger

2221
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:06,840
right at all costs yeah and this is like

2222
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:08,219
80 of your online battles yeah and it's

2223
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,219
probably gonna be this episode is going

2224
01:28:08,219 --> 01:28:13,800
to definitely ignite it is you

2225
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,600
saying something that is generally well

2226
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,400
known

2227
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,900
amongst the small group of in the know

2228
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:21,299
type people in the Cannabis Community

2229
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:25,079
but you know maybe isn't well known to

2230
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:26,219
the larger Community yeah right and like

2231
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:28,920
even though it might be well known

2232
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:31,560
within a few thousand people they don't

2233
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:34,139
want the larger Canada Community to hear

2234
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:35,699
that correct yeah so then they attack

2235
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:37,800
you like crazy

2236
01:28:35,698 --> 01:28:41,698
yeah you know you've seen this recently

2237
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:44,699
yourself like oh yeah it's not it makes

2238
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:46,379
it difficult and you know and and some

2239
01:28:44,698 --> 01:28:48,178
of these people have deeper pockets and

2240
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:50,639
more political power

2241
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:54,480
or I just have all the time in the world

2242
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:56,219
to be demons I mean I I will say

2243
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:58,759
that what's funny about it and I

2244
01:28:56,219 --> 01:29:02,219
mentioned it before but like literally

2245
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:05,760
the person who the thin mint accident

2246
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:07,560
happened in their room is probably the

2247
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,920
least famous cookie person

2248
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:14,159
yeah yeah I'd say so

2249
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:16,319
you know it's probably the least yeah

2250
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:18,299
I can yeah and I can see why you know

2251
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:19,380
the stories always come back to this

2252
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,060
because

2253
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:23,579
cookies

2254
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:26,639
embodies a lot of what the industry is

2255
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:29,460
going through as a whole it is typifies

2256
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:32,219
some of the current inclinations right

2257
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:35,880
of the industry for better or worse

2258
01:29:32,219 --> 01:29:39,060
yeah big time and and the Mystery of

2259
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:41,699
strains uh it definitely helps with that

2260
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:43,560
because mystery drives sales and there

2261
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:44,939
is some mystery to cookies like there is

2262
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,639
disagreements between what it is and

2263
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:49,919
what people say it is I mean there's a

2264
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:53,179
thing I posted on my Ig a while back

2265
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:57,060
it's like a New Yorker uh cartoon

2266
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:59,158
and they were talking about history

2267
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:01,260
um you know and I'm paraphrasing here

2268
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:03,479
but there's a guy that's like oh I

2269
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,820
remember it differently in a way that

2270
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:07,919
paints me in a positive light and gives

2271
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:10,439
me the credit yeah

2272
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,239
right and so that's the thing that Matt

2273
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:16,500
and I run into all the time with talking

2274
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:17,759
wheat history is the vast majority of

2275
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,260
people

2276
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,960
in weed

2277
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:23,940
are interested in history that makes

2278
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,859
them look good and buttresses their

2279
01:30:23,939 --> 01:30:27,539
pocketbook yeah

2280
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:30,839
or

2281
01:30:27,539 --> 01:30:32,760
you know even with Old-Timers whose

2282
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,800
history is decades ago

2283
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:37,199
their interest in the history is how can

2284
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:40,020
it benefit me today right now and in the

2285
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:41,579
future yeah there's a lot of that and

2286
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:44,159
you start you get that you get these

2287
01:30:41,579 --> 01:30:46,198
conversations that go on and the first

2288
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:48,299
conversation is pretty open and forward

2289
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:49,799
and then the next couple once they

2290
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,300
realize that there's some money or some

2291
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,039
rep to be made

2292
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,500
all of a sudden the story starts

2293
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:57,359
changing and people start getting huffy

2294
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:00,300
and angry about stuff

2295
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:02,939
and how dare how dare you bring up that

2296
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:05,039
I contradicted myself a month before on

2297
01:31:02,939 --> 01:31:06,719
the episode that we talked about it yeah

2298
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,698
this this is what I'm currently

2299
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:11,100
promoting yeah

2300
01:31:08,698 --> 01:31:13,439
so it's like I could you know do I know

2301
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:16,560
the entire story inside and out with all

2302
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:18,658
details no no but I'm not even sure the

2303
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:22,380
core people know the entire story inside

2304
01:31:18,658 --> 01:31:24,779
and out because they all hit hid parts

2305
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:26,819
of it from one another intentionally

2306
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:29,219
yeah

2307
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:31,920
right and so everybody has pieces like

2308
01:31:29,219 --> 01:31:34,139
for instance you know the the guy that

2309
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:37,920
you know the accident happened in he's

2310
01:31:34,139 --> 01:31:39,840
been trying to recreate it using pieces

2311
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,119
that the other people didn't have or

2312
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,860
didn't know about yeah

2313
01:31:42,119 --> 01:31:45,779
because different people got brought in

2314
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:47,579
at different times

2315
01:31:45,779 --> 01:31:48,779
you know and it is I start talking about

2316
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:51,658
the truth

2317
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:53,099
and there's like big brands

2318
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:56,399
that are all going to be all pissed off

2319
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:57,900
at me oh yeah yeah and like and and

2320
01:31:56,399 --> 01:31:59,279
they're investors what do their

2321
01:31:57,899 --> 01:32:00,899
investors want return on their

2322
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:03,899
investment

2323
01:32:00,899 --> 01:32:06,359
Roi baby you know what do the people

2324
01:32:03,899 --> 01:32:09,179
want you know I mean they want to be

2325
01:32:06,359 --> 01:32:11,399
rich and famous and have money yeah I

2326
01:32:09,179 --> 01:32:13,319
mean Matt and I joke you know but this

2327
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:17,279
is very much this is very much a cookie

2328
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:18,719
phenomenon where you know most real

2329
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:21,840
breeders

2330
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,399
are somewhat anti-social

2331
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:26,940
maybe you have a touch of the Chisholm

2332
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:29,579
yeah don't like to be that public

2333
01:32:26,939 --> 01:32:33,419
and um you know

2334
01:32:29,579 --> 01:32:36,238
and the cookie era brought in uh weed

2335
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:37,739
celebrity yeah where all of a sudden it

2336
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:40,138
became very important where some of

2337
01:32:37,738 --> 01:32:41,879
these guys are they're at an art gallery

2338
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:44,219
in LA

2339
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:47,760
they're flying out to New York they're

2340
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:49,020
small they're smoking joints dressed to

2341
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,560
the nines

2342
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:54,659
yeah right they're hiring photographers

2343
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:57,420
to literally make them look good and

2344
01:32:54,658 --> 01:32:59,638
sexy and cool while they're checking out

2345
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:01,139
their plants I don't even know how you

2346
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:04,139
afford that but yeah they do that a lot

2347
01:33:01,139 --> 01:33:06,539
they turn they turn going to the Garden

2348
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:08,039
into a photo op

2349
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:09,779
yeah

2350
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:11,698
yeah they go to their friends Gardens

2351
01:33:09,779 --> 01:33:15,059
that they don't even own

2352
01:33:11,698 --> 01:33:17,039
and they could look like a photo op that

2353
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:19,260
they're checking on their plants this is

2354
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,000
true and Matt's laughing about it but

2355
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:23,579
like one of the things that

2356
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,920
if you start getting photographed in LA

2357
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:27,238
and then San Diego and in New York and

2358
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,039
flying around and at all these

2359
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:30,439
conferences and doing all this stuff all

2360
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:32,939
the time

2361
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:36,119
it's very obvious

2362
01:33:32,939 --> 01:33:37,738
you're not actually growing to Growers

2363
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:40,019
it's very obvious you're the Growers

2364
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:43,799
it's very obvious because in order to do

2365
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:45,960
a good job you are married you I I don't

2366
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,400
know any of us who are able to take a

2367
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:49,679
vacation for more than two days without

2368
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:51,259
freaking out like it just it's what it

2369
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:53,819
is it's the Life

2370
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:55,500
part of it and so it's like it's not

2371
01:33:53,819 --> 01:33:57,359
yeah it's not like you can't leave ever

2372
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,460
or like have some friends you know it's

2373
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:02,339
not like you can't time it

2374
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:04,260
to where like you you can get a free

2375
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:06,600
week or a free 10 days or something like

2376
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:08,760
that here or there yeah but what

2377
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:12,480
happened is is that

2378
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:16,500
a lot of these guys are the front man

2379
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:17,939
they are the promotion wing of this

2380
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,520
conglomerate

2381
01:34:17,939 --> 01:34:24,059
right and they hire

2382
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:25,020
out the work yeah so that gives them the

2383
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:28,500
freedom

2384
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:30,300
to be wearing a cool hat and to catch

2385
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:32,158
the smoke going around their face just

2386
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:35,159
so as they're standing outside the club

2387
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:36,719
you know and they're touring you know a

2388
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:39,179
lot of times they'll hook up with

2389
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,800
friends to go tour facilities

2390
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:41,940
and never mention it's not their

2391
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,400
facility

2392
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:46,319
yeah and so it gives people the sense

2393
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:48,539
that these guys have big things going on

2394
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:50,519
all over the place well yeah girls let

2395
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:52,920
let them put e-cigarettes in their in

2396
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:54,659
their bum hole and and make ads out of

2397
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,300
them I mean it just it's what it what it

2398
01:34:54,658 --> 01:35:00,559
is is that weed really wasn't ready for

2399
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:04,279
modern marketing techniques no it was

2400
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:07,080
so we were extremely susceptible

2401
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:09,599
to very basic modern marketing

2402
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:12,119
techniques and since there wasn't any

2403
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:15,780
celebrities

2404
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:17,579
we were very susceptible to all of these

2405
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:19,920
sort of new school celebrities and the

2406
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:23,519
way that you become a celebrity in weed

2407
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:25,440
is by being associated or an OG that

2408
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,900
just so happened to be near some strain

2409
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:31,379
that became famous in my opinion yeah

2410
01:35:27,899 --> 01:35:34,619
that's the classic way to become famous

2411
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:36,539
and oftentimes the person that speaks up

2412
01:35:34,619 --> 01:35:39,899
publicly about it

2413
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:42,238
becomes the most well-known

2414
01:35:39,899 --> 01:35:44,158
even if they just got the cut relatively

2415
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:45,599
early it had nothing to do with it oh

2416
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:47,879
yeah

2417
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:51,960
you know I mean going back think about

2418
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:53,760
think about like how how much I mean

2419
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,198
this might get people this might get him

2420
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,619
mad at me or whatever but I don't care

2421
01:35:55,198 --> 01:36:01,619
like think about how intent Sam gunkman

2422
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:04,439
was of being on all of the early forums

2423
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:07,319
and battling so that his view on what

2424
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:09,000
happened was the view oh yeah for sure

2425
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:10,380
and it wasn't like there was four or

2426
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,960
five other dudes that were all there

2427
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:14,760
that were competing with him no So

2428
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,198
eventually when you repeat something

2429
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,460
like that over and over and over and

2430
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:20,219
over again

2431
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:25,079
it gets pushed into the fabric of the

2432
01:36:20,219 --> 01:36:26,819
tail yes it's very hard to dislodge

2433
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:29,340
yeah it's like a turn to punch bowl just

2434
01:36:26,819 --> 01:36:32,759
keeps popping back up you know and and

2435
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:34,739
so you know what you know but it it's

2436
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:37,079
one of those things where now back then

2437
01:36:34,738 --> 01:36:39,059
he didn't show his face

2438
01:36:37,079 --> 01:36:41,460
and he would have different monikers on

2439
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:43,800
different on on different forums

2440
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:46,679
yeah but everybody knew you know you

2441
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:48,719
know not everybody we knew yeah you know

2442
01:36:46,679 --> 01:36:50,219
right not every I mean I mean that's

2443
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:52,619
what we were talking about it earlier

2444
01:36:50,219 --> 01:36:54,480
but like there's a lot of stuff that's

2445
01:36:52,619 --> 01:36:57,479
fairly common knowledge

2446
01:36:54,479 --> 01:37:00,119
within a very a relatively small group

2447
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:02,339
of wheat insiders yeah that the public

2448
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:04,260
is totally ignorant of and that's that's

2449
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:07,020
kind of why I wanted to do this episode

2450
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:09,659
today because like a lot of the people

2451
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:11,940
coming in don't understand why we have

2452
01:37:09,658 --> 01:37:14,339
the take on cookies being just inbred

2453
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:16,379
garbage and why like when new seed

2454
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:17,639
makers and I definitely specify the

2455
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:18,779
difference between breeders and Seed

2456
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:21,659
makers because there's a major

2457
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:22,920
difference when new seed makers like

2458
01:37:21,658 --> 01:37:25,679
come to me and they're like hey check

2459
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:27,899
out this [ __ ] Forum crossed OG I'm

2460
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:30,000
doing this is breaking this is gonna

2461
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:31,619
break new ground and I I just don't have

2462
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,719
a good response for them and sometimes

2463
01:37:31,619 --> 01:37:35,158
I'm just like man maybe you should try

2464
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:36,899
something different because that's been

2465
01:37:35,158 --> 01:37:39,599
done A Hundred Ways to Sunday and they

2466
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:41,399
don't get it I I mean I don't you know I

2467
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,980
get hesitant to mention names on here

2468
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:46,138
because inevitably like it'll be a 15

2469
01:37:43,979 --> 01:37:49,379
second clip that gets cut out in the

2470
01:37:46,139 --> 01:37:53,940
personal oh yeah PM's all angry but you

2471
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:55,920
know being that cookies and Kush has

2472
01:37:53,939 --> 01:37:57,899
been Blended by

2473
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,158
lots and lots and lots of different

2474
01:37:57,899 --> 01:38:02,279
people

2475
01:37:59,158 --> 01:38:04,198
it is very unlikely that by blending

2476
01:38:02,279 --> 01:38:06,198
these things you're going to come up

2477
01:38:04,198 --> 01:38:09,119
with something truly new and unique

2478
01:38:06,198 --> 01:38:11,399
exactly we have this running joke on the

2479
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:14,760
Discord where like you know we'll post

2480
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:18,238
pictures of that new new yes and it

2481
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:21,060
looks like the same ultra dense frosted

2482
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:22,379
purplish cookie type weed that we've

2483
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:24,780
been seeing for the better part of the

2484
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:26,639
last 14 years I mean to me it doesn't

2485
01:38:24,779 --> 01:38:28,559
matter if you call it jealousy if you

2486
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,359
call it cookies if you call it whatever

2487
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,239
cheetah piss whatever name they have for

2488
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:35,039
it today it's always some form of inbred

2489
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:36,599
in crossed cookies maybe with a single

2490
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:38,460
outcross somewhere in there to try to

2491
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:40,739
give it that fact of it it just doesn't

2492
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:43,079
I mean I'll throw something else out

2493
01:38:40,738 --> 01:38:44,879
there for a second you know

2494
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:48,000
um and maybe this is controversial or

2495
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,199
whatnot but I actually respect

2496
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,779
okay

2497
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:53,759
burner and cookie

2498
01:38:51,779 --> 01:38:56,759
um going to going and trying to work

2499
01:38:53,760 --> 01:39:00,300
with our buddy Bodhi

2500
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:01,860
and I'll tell you why okay

2501
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:04,980
the reason is

2502
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:08,399
that that I is because

2503
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:09,419
that stuff is long overdue

2504
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:12,238
yeah

2505
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:14,158
for someone to take it

2506
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:15,658
and to take it in a totally different

2507
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:17,759
direction

2508
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:20,219
yeah they've already done the seed

2509
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,860
junkie they've already done the the the

2510
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:25,260
the the Chris compound they've already

2511
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:27,899
done as many variations on the theme as

2512
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:29,219
you can yeah you can have other breeders

2513
01:39:27,899 --> 01:39:32,099
out there being like I'm gonna cross

2514
01:39:29,219 --> 01:39:35,819
cherry pie to Kush but not this kush

2515
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:37,139
yeah exactly yeah you know and so you

2516
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:38,880
know like I mean they didn't really do

2517
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:41,100
it but like really what what you know

2518
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,679
what cookies needs is like they can be

2519
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:46,760
like hey Bodhi cross it to this weird

2520
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:49,980
Cambodian you have yeah

2521
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:51,239
way different you know what we want out

2522
01:39:49,979 --> 01:39:53,039
of this cookie we want the cookie to

2523
01:39:51,238 --> 01:39:54,839
like bring down the flowering time and

2524
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,760
add some density to this larfy ass

2525
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:59,579
[ __ ] you know what I'm saying and

2526
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:01,139
take it from 18 weeks to 12.

2527
01:39:59,579 --> 01:40:03,539
like that's what we're looking for

2528
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:05,460
cookie needs to go in a totally

2529
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:07,079
different direction

2530
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:10,619
even if

2531
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:12,238
that direction is risky yeah right

2532
01:40:10,619 --> 01:40:13,979
because you think that the corporation

2533
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:15,299
itself has actually recognized this

2534
01:40:13,979 --> 01:40:18,539
properly

2535
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:22,440
well the problem that they faced is that

2536
01:40:18,539 --> 01:40:23,779
is is that body and cookie are such

2537
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:28,138
different

2538
01:40:23,779 --> 01:40:30,719
pieces of the of the canopy that both

2539
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:32,699
fan bases were sort of insulted that the

2540
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:36,119
other one worked with the other one yeah

2541
01:40:32,698 --> 01:40:38,158
like it didn't go over well you know as

2542
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:41,099
soon as they announced the as soon as

2543
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:44,399
they announced the [ __ ] like our homie

2544
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:47,760
got mad Flack yeah burner had to turn

2545
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:50,819
off comments you know it was basically

2546
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:53,159
like you know Luke Skywalker being like

2547
01:40:50,819 --> 01:40:55,380
I'm in a bond with the Empire but I'm

2548
01:40:53,158 --> 01:40:57,539
not going to try to change them

2549
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:59,460
at all I'm not gonna try to like save my

2550
01:40:57,539 --> 01:41:01,319
dad or anything like that I just really

2551
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:03,420
like like they've won

2552
01:41:01,319 --> 01:41:05,939
so I might as well hitch my horse to

2553
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:08,399
that guinea and go with it right and so

2554
01:41:05,939 --> 01:41:10,619
it didn't go over very well but

2555
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:12,779
you know it's like if you want something

2556
01:41:10,619 --> 01:41:14,939
that's not same same

2557
01:41:12,779 --> 01:41:16,380
right because it's almost like if I

2558
01:41:14,939 --> 01:41:17,479
wanted to take it like in a musical

2559
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:21,000
Direction

2560
01:41:17,479 --> 01:41:24,059
what cookie needs is Cookie needs to go

2561
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,399
in a totally different genre Direction

2562
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:27,780
yeah right like think about like every

2563
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,238
music thing something comes out with

2564
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:33,000
music that's new and unique

2565
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:35,339
fast forward 10 or 15 years and there's

2566
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,520
a million bands making slight variations

2567
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:41,100
on the same theme yeah but it's not new

2568
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:43,199
it's the same well-traveled [ __ ] they're

2569
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:45,239
just trying to extract more money and

2570
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:47,339
then eventually the kids are like this

2571
01:41:45,238 --> 01:41:49,859
isn't cool and they move on to something

2572
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:50,940
else and then they make dubstep and ruin

2573
01:41:49,859 --> 01:41:53,519
it all

2574
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:55,500
well I mean if if you want to look at it

2575
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:58,020
and I don't know if you I've used this

2576
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:00,479
example a bunch privately but I think

2577
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:02,400
one of the most important bands in

2578
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:06,419
America and like in my lifetime in

2579
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:08,279
America was Nirvana oh Jesus no no check

2580
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:11,158
it out dude because I'm a little bit

2581
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:15,179
older than you all right and a lot older

2582
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:17,638
before Nirvana came out everything in

2583
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:20,158
pop everything in rock and everything on

2584
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:21,600
the radio and everything on MTV was

2585
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:25,198
poison

2586
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:29,579
Def Leppard warrant Winger enough's

2587
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:34,500
enough hair bands out the wazoo

2588
01:42:29,579 --> 01:42:37,019
right that was all it was Cinderella

2589
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:39,618
you know Bon Jovi

2590
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:44,460
right like great white shark

2591
01:42:39,618 --> 01:42:46,920
yeah striper yeah Winger warrant

2592
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:50,039
you know and they're all variations on

2593
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,420
the same theme and then Nirvana comes

2594
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:53,100
out and every single one of those

2595
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:54,480
[ __ ] lost their job except for

2596
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:58,739
Bon Jovi

2597
01:42:54,479 --> 01:43:00,658
and maybe one other slash they literally

2598
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:04,019
like guns and roses and Bon Jovi

2599
01:43:00,658 --> 01:43:05,759
survived yeah everybody else died

2600
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:08,280
yeah they were like this isn't cool

2601
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,780
anymore Motley Crew can't forget Motley

2602
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:12,359
Crue they did survive something modeling

2603
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:14,939
crew survived okay but what I'm saying

2604
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:16,738
is it went from literally dozens upon

2605
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:19,379
dozens of bands that were basically

2606
01:43:16,738 --> 01:43:22,138
variations on the same theme

2607
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:25,139
to two or three surviving and the entire

2608
01:43:22,139 --> 01:43:27,539
90s post Nirvana was different musically

2609
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:31,020
yeah I get yeah so you can not like them

2610
01:43:27,539 --> 01:43:33,000
but it was like after Nirvana

2611
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:35,100
every music executive went to Seattle

2612
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,260
and signed every single band they could

2613
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:38,520
find and everything after sounded like

2614
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:40,440
Eddie Vedder

2615
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:43,020
but they did right like because they

2616
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:45,000
realized that like the the mood had

2617
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:46,679
shifted yeah

2618
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,560
you weren't going to be able to get a

2619
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:52,319
big hair band in acid wash jeans and an

2620
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:55,199
entire bottle of Aquanet playing a huge

2621
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:57,299
heart-shaped guitar yeah and you would

2622
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,460
have a rocking tune and then a power

2623
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,739
ballad

2624
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:04,260
you know like that formula was done yeah

2625
01:44:01,738 --> 01:44:07,019
they needed a new formula

2626
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:09,539
speaking of new formulas I wanted to get

2627
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:11,460
into this before we like totally forget

2628
01:44:09,539 --> 01:44:13,859
it let me see how I bring it back but

2629
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:16,260
but hold just one second let me let me

2630
01:44:13,859 --> 01:44:20,279
just finish that thought so what cookies

2631
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:23,280
needs okay is cookies absolutely needs

2632
01:44:20,279 --> 01:44:26,399
to step out of its comfort zone

2633
01:44:23,279 --> 01:44:28,979
and be like what are the qualities in

2634
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:30,839
this weed that we could add on to

2635
01:44:28,979 --> 01:44:33,539
totally different weed

2636
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:35,579
that would then be the sum of its parts

2637
01:44:33,539 --> 01:44:37,340
because or better than the sum of its

2638
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:39,899
parts because for the last 14 years

2639
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:42,060
they've been inbreeding and trying to

2640
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:43,799
create various variations on the same

2641
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:46,020
theme

2642
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:48,600
and now it's all cookies it's all gelato

2643
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:50,520
it's all runs which is cookies in July

2644
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:53,460
it's all just it's all the same

2645
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:56,340
incestuous family yeah and a million

2646
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:58,139
different names attached to it right and

2647
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:00,840
that's going to fade

2648
01:44:58,139 --> 01:45:03,719
right so what people need to do is they

2649
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:07,020
need to take the useful parts of cookie

2650
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:09,840
and be like genetically what can we add

2651
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:11,699
like because cookies is so dense maybe

2652
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:14,760
we can add it to like some really larfy

2653
01:45:11,698 --> 01:45:16,799
stuff and like solidify it a little bit

2654
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:18,420
maybe we can add it to this maybe we can

2655
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,039
do this with it like they need to step

2656
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:22,679
out of their box they're not going to be

2657
01:45:20,039 --> 01:45:25,618
able to keep just rebranding the same

2658
01:45:22,679 --> 01:45:27,539
weed for the next 20 years

2659
01:45:25,618 --> 01:45:29,579
I don't know exactly when people are

2660
01:45:27,539 --> 01:45:31,500
going to move on from cookie but they

2661
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:33,359
will

2662
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:37,880
because they've moved on from every

2663
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:37,880
other fad or phase that we've ever had

2664
01:45:38,158 --> 01:45:43,379
you know what I'm saying yeah yeah for

2665
01:45:40,738 --> 01:45:45,959
sure I mean imagine if imagine if like

2666
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:48,480
we were still listening to warrant

2667
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:50,039
yeah some people do it's horrible right

2668
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:51,839
but it's like but most people that

2669
01:45:50,039 --> 01:45:52,859
listen to it it's like that's what they

2670
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,300
were listening to when they were in

2671
01:45:52,859 --> 01:45:57,000
their teens in their 20s and it just

2672
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:59,639
reminds them of their youth that's true

2673
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,639
right it's like that's kind of how music

2674
01:45:59,639 --> 01:46:05,579
goes it becomes like you know like it

2675
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:08,039
becomes for old people yeah what are the

2676
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:09,420
new kids into

2677
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:13,399
right

2678
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:15,779
so taking that

2679
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:17,579
uncsi have been working on some things

2680
01:46:15,779 --> 01:46:19,319
and some of them some of them I've been

2681
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:21,000
working on with like the F1 derp stuff

2682
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:23,340
we've been trying to go in and figure

2683
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,139
out some things with the F1 dirt because

2684
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:27,719
it was so

2685
01:46:25,139 --> 01:46:29,279
lauded by some and then some just

2686
01:46:27,719 --> 01:46:31,198
basically said it didn't exist we wanted

2687
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:35,099
to see what happens when you cross this

2688
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:36,779
to your Flo Rida OG cut so he took that

2689
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:39,000
and you guys crossed it and we're gonna

2690
01:46:36,779 --> 01:46:42,359
see what comes from that we also have

2691
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,639
the 56 day headband cut across two the

2692
01:46:42,359 --> 01:46:47,880
F1 derb to see how that direction goes

2693
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:51,719
with some kind of headband derb but

2694
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:54,000
mainly with uncsi you had given him your

2695
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:55,439
your La Kush Headband cut and we've

2696
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,260
talked about it you know I think there's

2697
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:59,759
a whole episode maybe even on it

2698
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:01,679
um but if you want to talk about some of

2699
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,900
these crosses and how it'll cross to say

2700
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:05,699
the Bubba Kush the different Thames the

2701
01:47:03,899 --> 01:47:07,379
bubble gum can you take a second to go

2702
01:47:05,698 --> 01:47:08,759
over a few of these

2703
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:12,960
sure

2704
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:17,460
um I mean just so just so people know

2705
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:20,939
um I've been sharing some of my

2706
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:24,359
um you know CSI is so prolific that I've

2707
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:27,118
been sharing some of my cuts with him

2708
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:29,039
um and then we've been doing some

2709
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:30,179
um you know some intentional breeding

2710
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:31,618
and then just like with every other

2711
01:47:30,179 --> 01:47:33,118
breeding you throw in some other stuff

2712
01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:35,759
in there that you think will work well

2713
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:38,698
sure right but so it's it's a mix of

2714
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:41,340
like you know making some cool seeds but

2715
01:47:38,698 --> 01:47:44,638
it's also a mix of of like well I wonder

2716
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:47,760
can we recreate certain things right so

2717
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:51,179
as people as people know or don't know

2718
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:52,500
um the 56 uh which a lot of people don't

2719
01:47:51,179 --> 01:47:56,420
call it that a lot of people just call

2720
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,420
it straight headband or the murder cat

2721
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:04,679
but it's basic story is that when Kush

2722
01:48:02,819 --> 01:48:07,679
was really tightly controlled and worth

2723
01:48:04,679 --> 01:48:08,480
a lot of money in SoCal there was this

2724
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:11,760
cut

2725
01:48:08,479 --> 01:48:14,218
and there was because it was worth so

2726
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:16,619
much money and because La is La there

2727
01:48:14,219 --> 01:48:18,300
was some violence around this cut and it

2728
01:48:16,618 --> 01:48:20,579
ended up going to the Bay

2729
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:22,260
and they wanted to like work with it in

2730
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:24,359
the bay but

2731
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,980
they didn't want to bring a bunch of

2732
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:29,158
heat that was occurring in Southern

2733
01:48:25,979 --> 01:48:31,738
California up to them yeah so they

2734
01:48:29,158 --> 01:48:34,198
decided to rename it headband

2735
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:37,019
to throw people off the trail

2736
01:48:34,198 --> 01:48:39,839
some people called it the 56 because it

2737
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:42,540
was done in roughly eight weeks so it's

2738
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:45,239
it's kind of one of those cuts that a

2739
01:48:42,539 --> 01:48:47,760
lot of people know as headband

2740
01:48:45,238 --> 01:48:49,198
um but it you know it was it was one of

2741
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:51,239
you know now you ask different people

2742
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:54,238
you know what it is and they'll be like

2743
01:48:51,238 --> 01:48:56,339
oh well it was the Kush

2744
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:59,759
and that's why people get so upset at it

2745
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:01,679
I will say that while it doesn't have my

2746
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:06,119
favorite Kush flavor

2747
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:08,460
it is by far the most potent Kush cut I

2748
01:49:06,118 --> 01:49:10,920
know of yeah it's very good very good

2749
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:12,060
you know I got it in 06.

2750
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,880
um there's other people that have it

2751
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:16,440
that got it from basically the same crew

2752
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:18,000
but it's floated around

2753
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:20,279
um different people call it different

2754
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,260
things one of Matt's buddies has it

2755
01:49:20,279 --> 01:49:24,658
there's a few other people that have had

2756
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:25,800
it and worked with it a little bit

2757
01:49:24,658 --> 01:49:30,299
um but

2758
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:32,340
it is uh it is a really good extremely

2759
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:34,260
potent some people find it too potent to

2760
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:36,840
smoke yeah which I know sounds like a

2761
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:39,300
lie but it does it has this thing which

2762
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:41,039
is strange for an Indica but uh Matt

2763
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:44,039
experiences this sometimes it gives

2764
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:46,260
people extreme anxiety oh yeah it's

2765
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:48,300
called The Fear the [ __ ] you know it

2766
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:51,000
gets people high enough that they get

2767
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:54,659
nervous yeah

2768
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,520
um so you know the uh so we have that um

2769
01:49:54,658 --> 01:49:58,859
that was across the F1 derb we have the

2770
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:00,480
flow right OG cross to the F1 derb in

2771
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:02,460
the list so those are basically what

2772
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:04,559
that is is that

2773
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:06,539
um you know since the Flow Rider I know

2774
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:09,119
for sure it's the it's the cushion

2775
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:10,979
cookie yeah because of when and who I

2776
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:14,460
got it from and what happened after that

2777
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:16,618
right so the the Flow Rider across the

2778
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:19,560
F1 derb is sort of like an attempt to

2779
01:50:16,618 --> 01:50:20,158
like mix some of the

2780
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,080
um

2781
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:24,899
some of the earlier generations of

2782
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:27,479
strains that led to cookie yeah maybe

2783
01:50:24,899 --> 01:50:29,819
it's not the exact claimed generation

2784
01:50:27,479 --> 01:50:33,118
that claimed lineage to see if it really

2785
01:50:29,819 --> 01:50:34,679
pans out yeah you know or it's in you

2786
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:37,079
know and it's it's a little bit more

2787
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:38,039
it's an attempt to do some intentional

2788
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:39,960
work

2789
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:43,139
where you get a where you get a chunk of

2790
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:46,139
seeds that isn't just like one bag seed

2791
01:50:43,139 --> 01:50:48,659
yeah and it's it's a way to look at

2792
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:50,279
I know nfcsi argues me on this all the

2793
01:50:48,658 --> 01:50:52,019
time but really it is a way to check out

2794
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:53,939
the parentage whether he likes David or

2795
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:56,580
not you can see the expressions and and

2796
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:58,138
traits of parents in those lines so

2797
01:50:56,579 --> 01:50:59,519
technically you can see what the the

2798
01:50:58,139 --> 01:51:01,859
sisters and brothers would look like

2799
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:04,080
yeah I mean so I I will say that you

2800
01:51:01,859 --> 01:51:05,880
know I mean I could I could explain some

2801
01:51:04,079 --> 01:51:09,118
of it the F1 derb

2802
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:11,100
is is the way that it was named and what

2803
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:13,799
it is and how it all works is it's been

2804
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:16,020
created intentionally mysterious yeah

2805
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:17,760
it's it was kind of the secret sauce

2806
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:22,320
that they didn't really want to let out

2807
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:24,360
what was part of it yeah right and so

2808
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:26,579
um you know that could be a way to get

2809
01:51:24,359 --> 01:51:29,399
some cookie-like stuff

2810
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:31,380
and and see what's going on you know now

2811
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:34,559
what's cool about the F1 derb is that it

2812
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:36,239
has color and it has Terps right and it

2813
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:40,380
has some unusual stuff like that going

2814
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:42,718
on hopefully by Crossing it to the um to

2815
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:45,420
the float to the Flow Rider into the 56

2816
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:47,520
you'd get some potency

2817
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:52,020
you know and some of that like dink dink

2818
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:54,840
dink dink dink classic look to it so

2819
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:57,060
we'll you know so we'll see we'll we'll

2820
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:59,819
see what happens with that the 56 is at

2821
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:02,460
the very least very early or the or one

2822
01:51:59,819 --> 01:52:06,299
of the earliest Kush cuts to come out of

2823
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:07,920
La yeah and the Flow Rider is you know

2824
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,659
it's it's it's another one of my

2825
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,279
favorites and it's another early one and

2826
01:52:09,658 --> 01:52:12,599
it and it uh it's it's definitely the

2827
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:14,819
one in cookie

2828
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:17,579
uh all right uh how about your your La

2829
01:52:14,819 --> 01:52:20,340
Kush Bubba Kush the headband publication

2830
01:52:17,579 --> 01:52:22,260
uh you know the LA like I've I've talked

2831
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:24,840
about it intensely

2832
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:26,520
um it's one of my favorite diesel cuts

2833
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:28,380
so

2834
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:29,820
um what the bubble would probably add is

2835
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:32,639
it would probably shorten up the

2836
01:52:29,819 --> 01:52:34,618
flowering time uh a lot of times some of

2837
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:37,618
these hybrids that people are running of

2838
01:52:34,618 --> 01:52:39,960
the LA they they can run 10 11 12 13

2839
01:52:37,618 --> 01:52:42,719
weeks sometimes yep

2840
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:45,179
um and so by Crossing it to Bubba you're

2841
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:47,399
Crossing it to something that's potent

2842
01:52:45,179 --> 01:52:50,399
um and it would hopefully uh maybe add a

2843
01:52:47,399 --> 01:52:52,979
little density maybe shorten the

2844
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:54,658
um the flowering time

2845
01:52:52,979 --> 01:52:57,118
um and both cuts are pretty potent in

2846
01:52:54,658 --> 01:52:59,460
different ways on their own

2847
01:52:57,118 --> 01:53:01,679
um we have we have one that we've seen

2848
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:05,300
uh quite a bit of which is the Indiana

2849
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:10,020
bubble gum reversed onto your La Kush

2850
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:12,000
yeah I mean uh the Indiana bubble gum

2851
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:14,219
it's kind of a weird one in the sense

2852
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,960
that it smells strongly of bubble gum

2853
01:53:14,219 --> 01:53:17,399
but the I would say it's pretty fair to

2854
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:20,340
say that the taste doesn't translate

2855
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:22,259
yeah and the hybrids tend to to not be

2856
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:24,600
as pink bubble gummy depending on what

2857
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:26,520
you cross it no but the the main thing

2858
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:28,739
about the bubble gum that's really nice

2859
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:31,800
is it seems to be

2860
01:53:28,738 --> 01:53:35,279
um it's a really good indoor and outdoor

2861
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:37,739
plant it's extremely resistant to mold

2862
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:40,679
yeah and just the way that it Stacks

2863
01:53:37,738 --> 01:53:43,138
nugs on itself and the way that it its

2864
01:53:40,679 --> 01:53:46,260
structure it's it's you know both in

2865
01:53:43,139 --> 01:53:48,239
branching and buds

2866
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:51,060
um as far as a production plant goes

2867
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:53,579
it's a it's a big winner it's a killer

2868
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:56,460
production and so hopefully uh what it

2869
01:53:53,579 --> 01:53:57,899
would do is it would make the the LA a

2870
01:53:56,460 --> 01:54:00,239
little bit more into a production plant

2871
01:53:57,899 --> 01:54:02,939
but you would get some of those Terps

2872
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:07,198
and some of that weird Zippy high that

2873
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:09,599
comes along with the um the LA yeah

2874
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:11,099
um so then we get into let's let's just

2875
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:12,420
put these all in one kind of category

2876
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:14,820
even though it's three different cuts

2877
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:18,179
that may not even be sisters chem D cam

2878
01:54:14,819 --> 01:54:19,799
number one and the dog m91

2879
01:54:18,179 --> 01:54:20,460
well

2880
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,560
um

2881
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:25,698
I'll start with d

2882
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:29,039
because uh it's been grown out a lot

2883
01:54:25,698 --> 01:54:32,219
that's been out it was so nice I loved

2884
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:34,560
it and you guys right

2885
01:54:32,219 --> 01:54:36,118
um that makes me happy that a lot of a

2886
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:38,940
lot of people have tagged me and stuff

2887
01:54:36,118 --> 01:54:40,979
or sent me or you know sent me uh Tales

2888
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:44,339
or pictures of their experiences with it

2889
01:54:40,979 --> 01:54:46,019
yeah um they're two of my favorite cuts

2890
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:49,880
um and it seems like

2891
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:53,280
it produces a whole bunch of gassy

2892
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:56,639
highly potent plants that have a decent

2893
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:58,920
amount of variety within them yeah

2894
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:02,400
um I would say you know I would say

2895
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:04,260
Terps you know gas gassy type

2896
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:07,439
um you know somewhat a little bit skunky

2897
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:09,780
Terps tend to come out quite a bit and

2898
01:55:07,439 --> 01:55:11,519
potency seems to be very common to find

2899
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:14,460
which isn't surprising because they're

2900
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,500
two of my favorite smokes

2901
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:18,000
um and uh so that one we've seen

2902
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:21,960
actually quite a bit of and I'm pretty

2903
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:24,179
stoked on it yeah how about the chem one

2904
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:25,380
the chem one I'm curious about that I

2905
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:27,779
think people would find interesting

2906
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:30,539
because it's it's by far

2907
01:55:27,779 --> 01:55:34,500
the least circulated surviving count

2908
01:55:30,539 --> 01:55:39,238
yeah it never went very far

2909
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:40,738
um it is a 12 to 13 week very sativa

2910
01:55:39,238 --> 01:55:41,519
looking

2911
01:55:40,738 --> 01:55:44,939
um

2912
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:48,960
you know uh very sativa looking long

2913
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:52,738
Spears big Spears chunky takes a long

2914
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:56,460
time 12 13 weeks that type of thing and

2915
01:55:52,738 --> 01:55:58,678
so by Crossing it to the LA which also

2916
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:01,139
takes you know anywhere from 10 to 11

2917
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:04,639
weeks easily you're probably going to

2918
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:08,159
get a big stretchy long flowering plant

2919
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:10,859
with a good amount of potency yeah you

2920
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:14,039
know and it's it's most people don't get

2921
01:56:10,859 --> 01:56:16,920
to try the chem one very much so it's

2922
01:56:14,039 --> 01:56:18,000
kind of uncirculated in uh to a large

2923
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,859
degree

2924
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,399
you know so

2925
01:56:19,859 --> 01:56:23,039
um

2926
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:25,859
that's kind of that one I think okay and

2927
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:27,300
the the dog 91 Kim

2928
01:56:25,859 --> 01:56:30,000
you know

2929
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:32,039
um the dog is pretty famous for making

2930
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,679
things look like itself

2931
01:56:32,039 --> 01:56:35,939
um

2932
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:40,319
I would make some I would expect some

2933
01:56:35,939 --> 01:56:42,000
phenos that look dog-like to some degree

2934
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:44,539
um but it also is one of the most

2935
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:48,479
consistent things that passes potency

2936
01:56:44,539 --> 01:56:50,639
and the LA is is probably in my top five

2937
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:52,799
as far as potent effects

2938
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:55,800
so that's what I can't I can't easily

2939
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:57,420
imagine this one yeah so and and but

2940
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:00,360
they have very different potent effects

2941
01:56:57,420 --> 01:57:03,480
uh La kind of has like this zippy

2942
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:06,299
somewhat uncomfortable like sometimes

2943
01:57:03,479 --> 01:57:09,259
confusing or slightly nervous Buzz yeah

2944
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:12,900
where the 91 has like a very warm

2945
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:14,599
relaxing energetic Buzz so we'll see how

2946
01:57:12,899 --> 01:57:17,759
that one combines

2947
01:57:14,599 --> 01:57:21,179
Mendo perps crossed to your headband now

2948
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:23,400
this is a very not so cross that is very

2949
01:57:21,179 --> 01:57:26,579
I mean both of those things I've had for

2950
01:57:23,399 --> 01:57:28,259
uh a couple of decades

2951
01:57:26,579 --> 01:57:31,679
um so they're two crosses of two of my

2952
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:33,739
oldest uh oldest longest held things

2953
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:37,560
um I would expect that one would be

2954
01:57:33,738 --> 01:57:40,319
extremely variable yeah the Mendo perps

2955
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:43,699
itself has a very wide variation even

2956
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:47,579
within the s1s yeah um so I would expect

2957
01:57:43,698 --> 01:57:50,519
a wide variety of colors

2958
01:57:47,579 --> 01:57:54,420
um what Mendo perps has in Spades is

2959
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:57,440
terpenes of a wide variety of types and

2960
01:57:54,420 --> 01:58:02,460
and a wide variety of different colors

2961
01:57:57,439 --> 01:58:06,598
and the LA has potency and

2962
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:09,060
um is very diesel like so I would also

2963
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:11,400
add that there's a good chance if you

2964
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:13,800
grow out enough of these seeds that you

2965
01:58:11,399 --> 01:58:17,219
can find what we people would classify

2966
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:19,920
as skunk skunk because inside the Mendo

2967
01:58:17,219 --> 01:58:22,380
purpose s1's at about a 10 range that

2968
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:24,239
expression is in there they're skunk and

2969
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:27,420
about a 10 range they're skunk and

2970
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:29,218
cushiness yeah and Mendo P

2971
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:31,199
um out of anything we've mentioned so

2972
01:58:29,219 --> 01:58:33,439
far I think that one might have the

2973
01:58:31,198 --> 01:58:36,299
widest

2974
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:38,638
phenotypes you know but within it you

2975
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:42,599
could probably find some real gems

2976
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:44,940
Obama kush a famous cut up in Oregon and

2977
01:58:42,599 --> 01:58:48,420
Humboldt area

2978
01:58:44,939 --> 01:58:51,899
Obama kush is Bubba Kush by Mendo P yeah

2979
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:54,300
so it probably won't be as crazy wide as

2980
01:58:51,899 --> 01:58:56,879
the thing we just talked about

2981
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:59,940
um but it'll probably do a you know it's

2982
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:01,859
it's you could probably take my comments

2983
01:58:59,939 --> 01:59:04,439
about La by

2984
01:59:01,859 --> 01:59:07,079
um by Bubba and la by purple and sort of

2985
01:59:04,439 --> 01:59:10,319
combine them yeah really and it in

2986
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:12,300
itself is a hybrid I would expect

2987
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:14,340
um you know the Bubba kind of breeds

2988
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:15,659
like Bubba

2989
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:19,560
you know

2990
01:59:15,658 --> 01:59:22,439
um you know but boy a lot of purple

2991
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:24,360
Bubba diesel really yeah purple Bubba

2992
01:59:22,439 --> 01:59:26,339
purple Bubba diesel would be a good way

2993
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:29,639
to look at it and the crazy thing about

2994
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:32,400
Meadow perps I will say is that it's not

2995
01:59:29,639 --> 01:59:35,460
just perps when you throw up the s1s you

2996
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:39,238
see everything from black to purple to

2997
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:41,579
Lavender to burgundy to Green

2998
01:59:39,238 --> 01:59:43,259
um it has a lot of different you know

2999
01:59:41,579 --> 01:59:45,840
like when I say burgundy there's some

3000
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:48,539
ones that are straight red yeah like

3001
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:50,579
very red so

3002
01:59:48,539 --> 01:59:52,560
um who knows what kind of looks could

3003
01:59:50,579 --> 01:59:55,198
get mixed into there

3004
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:57,539
and the last but not least certainly not

3005
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:59,098
least is the the headband triangle which

3006
01:59:57,539 --> 02:00:00,479
has also been grown out of time and I

3007
01:59:59,099 --> 02:00:02,219
smoked a lot of them

3008
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:04,738
yeah that one

3009
02:00:02,219 --> 02:00:06,719
um I people have sent me stuff of that I

3010
02:00:04,738 --> 02:00:08,519
you know not not like I don't think I've

3011
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:10,980
gotten any actual samples but pictures

3012
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:13,679
and various things it's a super Sour OG

3013
02:00:10,979 --> 02:00:16,138
it's you know uh it's that's basically

3014
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:18,118
going to be a like a you know yeah a

3015
02:00:16,139 --> 02:00:21,840
Sour Kush yeah

3016
02:00:18,118 --> 02:00:24,118
in a way you know but it's probably a

3017
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:25,980
Sour Kush that's made out of

3018
02:00:24,118 --> 02:00:27,960
um you know the triangle has kind of a

3019
02:00:25,979 --> 02:00:29,218
wider genetic base than a lot of cushes

3020
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:31,198
do

3021
02:00:29,219 --> 02:00:32,760
um and the LA is probably a different

3022
02:00:31,198 --> 02:00:34,738
sour than most people are used to

3023
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:38,400
smoking so it's probably a different

3024
02:00:34,738 --> 02:00:41,399
take on those flavors yeah and and I was

3025
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:43,920
like sour ogs I I put those up there

3026
02:00:41,399 --> 02:00:45,479
with blueberry as as probably my top

3027
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:48,420
favorite smokes of something I can smoke

3028
02:00:45,479 --> 02:00:50,519
all the time I tend granted sour and OG

3029
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:52,618
combined in many different ways but I

3030
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:54,540
tend to like most sour ogis that I've

3031
02:00:52,618 --> 02:00:57,839
come across as far as the hive yeah I

3032
02:00:54,539 --> 02:01:00,238
mean it's two of the you know the it's

3033
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:03,480
the two lines that were the most famous

3034
02:01:00,238 --> 02:01:06,419
in terms of like fads prior to cookie

3035
02:01:03,479 --> 02:01:09,479
probably yeah um the sour and the and

3036
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:11,279
the OG era sort of overlapped

3037
02:01:09,479 --> 02:01:14,158
if you were

3038
02:01:11,279 --> 02:01:16,800
um you know who knows how many different

3039
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:18,960
hybrids we would have gotten of all that

3040
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:21,659
stuff if it would have been during the

3041
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:23,639
prime of the reversal era yeah for sure

3042
02:01:21,658 --> 02:01:25,439
you know because it's Prime was a little

3043
02:01:23,639 --> 02:01:28,440
bit before that didn't mean it still

3044
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:29,579
didn't happen on occasion yeah um you

3045
02:01:28,439 --> 02:01:32,759
know but

3046
02:01:29,579 --> 02:01:34,800
but uh but you know huh go ahead on this

3047
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:37,560
note I was just curious um you know

3048
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:39,659
y'all talked about the 56th day is that

3049
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:42,119
one hard to reverse and would it be

3050
02:01:39,658 --> 02:01:44,879
interesting to see the LA and the 56

3051
02:01:42,118 --> 02:01:46,799
yeah all ogs are hard to reverse and all

3052
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:49,199
diesels are hard to reverse it just is

3053
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,880
what it is like pure OG's OG types that

3054
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:52,859
are very lanky

3055
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:54,779
I mean that's why that's why

3056
02:01:52,859 --> 02:01:56,219
thousand-fold you don't see on the

3057
02:01:54,779 --> 02:02:00,719
market

3058
02:01:56,219 --> 02:02:03,960
um a bunch of of diesel type s1s

3059
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:07,139
yeah because often it fails or people

3060
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:09,359
don't get what they consider to be a

3061
02:02:07,139 --> 02:02:11,699
sellable amount of seed a commercially

3062
02:02:09,359 --> 02:02:12,839
viable yeah yeah you know it's like

3063
02:02:11,698 --> 02:02:14,579
they're like oh I went through this

3064
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:16,020
whole I have to do it and I got 200

3065
02:02:14,579 --> 02:02:17,880
seeds

3066
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:19,080
and I actually don't want to sell any of

3067
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:20,520
them because I just went through all

3068
02:02:19,079 --> 02:02:22,500
that effort and I want to see what's in

3069
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:23,820
them or if you wanted to sell them to

3070
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:25,738
make your money back you'd have to sell

3071
02:02:23,819 --> 02:02:28,259
them at 500 a pack and people just slip

3072
02:02:25,738 --> 02:02:29,759
when you do that like it's yeah it

3073
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:33,480
doesn't work and you know a lot of times

3074
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:36,719
I'll interject this too what also drove

3075
02:02:33,479 --> 02:02:39,598
a lot of the early

3076
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:41,520
um reversal seed sales uh when the thing

3077
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:44,340
boomed like I was talking about maybe an

3078
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:47,880
hour ago on the show is

3079
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:50,219
people couldn't get a hold of uh

3080
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:53,219
certain cookie Cuts or the Skittles Cuts

3081
02:02:50,219 --> 02:02:56,219
or this cut or that cut you know so

3082
02:02:53,219 --> 02:02:58,859
people were able to reverse them and

3083
02:02:56,219 --> 02:03:01,859
sell s1s and sell hybrids

3084
02:02:58,859 --> 02:03:03,420
and sell them for a lot per pack because

3085
02:03:01,859 --> 02:03:05,399
it was the only way you could get access

3086
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:06,719
to the genetics

3087
02:03:05,399 --> 02:03:08,638
yeah

3088
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:10,560
yeah I mean think about like when think

3089
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:12,840
about Matt when Dying Breed first was

3090
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:15,480
selling at EC and nobody could get a

3091
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:17,400
hold of Skittles

3092
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:18,899
right no they were selling literally

3093
02:03:17,399 --> 02:03:20,759
everything that they could cross the

3094
02:03:18,899 --> 02:03:22,559
Skittles for three to five hundred three

3095
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:24,420
six hundred a pack

3096
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:25,980
yeah but they wouldn't have been able to

3097
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:29,099
do that if people would have been able

3098
02:03:25,979 --> 02:03:32,399
to get the cut itself exactly exactly

3099
02:03:29,099 --> 02:03:35,039
you know so it's like so it doesn't he

3100
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:36,598
talked enough just serious I was gonna

3101
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:37,979
say I only brought it up because I think

3102
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:40,079
you were in the chat yesterday as well

3103
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:42,598
not so when someone was like oh why have

3104
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:44,399
why isn't it like an LA sour I'm like uh

3105
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:47,719
think historically those two have not

3106
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:52,979
been able to be reversed for you know

3107
02:03:47,719 --> 02:03:56,219
yeah I mean even uh like take CSI

3108
02:03:52,979 --> 02:04:00,238
um all the s all the seeds of TK that he

3109
02:03:56,219 --> 02:04:03,300
sold were his third try yeah he

3110
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:05,819
completely failed the first two times

3111
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:08,099
and even the third try was a failure by

3112
02:04:05,819 --> 02:04:11,399
his standards he got about 10 percent

3113
02:04:08,099 --> 02:04:12,900
maybe 15 of the amount of seeds that he

3114
02:04:11,399 --> 02:04:15,059
would normally want to get from a

3115
02:04:12,899 --> 02:04:16,679
project like that and now one thing I

3116
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:18,300
keep pointing out and I want to want to

3117
02:04:16,679 --> 02:04:20,099
stress on this was that these projects

3118
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:22,079
that you guys worked on

3119
02:04:20,099 --> 02:04:23,880
they weren't individ they weren't done

3120
02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:26,039
all at once they were each of those

3121
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:27,719
reversals was done individually at

3122
02:04:26,039 --> 02:04:31,738
different spots so this is a project

3123
02:04:27,719 --> 02:04:33,899
done over years and lots of space and

3124
02:04:31,738 --> 02:04:35,459
lots of time it's not just like a hit

3125
02:04:33,899 --> 02:04:37,979
him one and done

3126
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:40,198
project it's it's there's a lot of time

3127
02:04:37,979 --> 02:04:41,939
and energy put into this stuff so mad

3128
02:04:40,198 --> 02:04:44,638
props on that and I'm still profoundly

3129
02:04:41,939 --> 02:04:46,979
available able to make it available and

3130
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:49,880
uh we're going to start the drop on

3131
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:53,459
Friday at 4 P.M for patreon uh Pacific

3132
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:55,380
and uh on June 23rd and for everyone

3133
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:57,118
else 8 P.M if there's anything left

3134
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:59,279
because they are limited

3135
02:04:57,118 --> 02:05:01,439
and I wanted to get that in I'll say one

3136
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:03,420
more thing too is uh

3137
02:05:01,439 --> 02:05:05,460
when it comes to breeding projects that

3138
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:08,699
I'm involved in

3139
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:10,500
um I I don't know I would say that I

3140
02:05:08,698 --> 02:05:13,439
lean much more towards

3141
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:15,060
things that interest me or things that I

3142
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:17,819
think people might be able to take into

3143
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:19,980
an interesting Direction yeah rather

3144
02:05:17,819 --> 02:05:21,719
than like what's very popular in the

3145
02:05:19,979 --> 02:05:25,439
moment and I think might just sell out

3146
02:05:21,719 --> 02:05:27,599
really fast yeah you know and so as a

3147
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:29,039
result of that you know like I'm always

3148
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:31,619
looking for stuff that people could take

3149
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:34,738
in a new and different direction and

3150
02:05:31,618 --> 02:05:36,539
especially mostly the primary thing is

3151
02:05:34,738 --> 02:05:40,138
like hopefully stuff that people will

3152
02:05:36,539 --> 02:05:42,779
like to smoke yeah effect

3153
02:05:40,139 --> 02:05:44,520
the effect very much so

3154
02:05:42,779 --> 02:05:47,279
I don't think you have any problems with

3155
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:48,060
this drop with that yeah no definitely

3156
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:49,500
not

3157
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:51,060
is there anything else we wanted to get

3158
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:53,639
in that we had written down thousand or

3159
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:55,619
is this a route no I think we're more or

3160
02:05:53,639 --> 02:05:57,000
less there all right is there anything

3161
02:05:55,618 --> 02:05:58,079
else you wanted to get in not so it's

3162
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,020
been a few weeks since we've had you

3163
02:05:58,079 --> 02:06:02,939
glad to see you again

3164
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:06,239
so second but we're gonna put him back

3165
02:06:02,939 --> 02:06:08,399
in until we reach 10K so if you want to

3166
02:06:06,238 --> 02:06:11,899
see him and keep seeing them subscribe

3167
02:06:08,399 --> 02:06:13,500
I'll be back I mean it is I will say

3168
02:06:11,899 --> 02:06:16,198
that

3169
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:18,479
um you know it is one of the things

3170
02:06:16,198 --> 02:06:20,399
about doing content that Matt and I have

3171
02:06:18,479 --> 02:06:22,019
learned is that when you start doing

3172
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:24,779
weekly content

3173
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:26,940
like anything else It's a Grind always

3174
02:06:24,779 --> 02:06:28,679
and you're trying you know you know it's

3175
02:06:26,939 --> 02:06:30,059
like you've got x amount of subjects you

3176
02:06:28,679 --> 02:06:32,219
find interesting

3177
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:33,480
and then you get into this mode of like

3178
02:06:32,219 --> 02:06:35,219
well what do people want to talk about

3179
02:06:33,479 --> 02:06:37,379
what do people want to hear about what's

3180
02:06:35,219 --> 02:06:39,000
new right

3181
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:40,739
um and you know talking how we talk

3182
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,359
about Canon history and trying to bring

3183
02:06:40,738 --> 02:06:44,098
out truth

3184
02:06:42,359 --> 02:06:48,420
um sometimes it causes ripples in the

3185
02:06:44,099 --> 02:06:49,260
force absolutely you know and um I Matt

3186
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:50,579
has

3187
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:53,760
you know

3188
02:06:50,579 --> 02:06:56,219
um I generally speaking avoid most of

3189
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:58,679
the ripples Matt is the one that gets

3190
02:06:56,219 --> 02:07:01,079
crashed by the waves so to speak yeah

3191
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:03,719
but we did some stuff recently where I

3192
02:07:01,079 --> 02:07:07,618
bore the full brunt of said ripples yeah

3193
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:09,779
and you know it it's not as easy

3194
02:07:07,618 --> 02:07:11,279
um or painless even

3195
02:07:09,779 --> 02:07:14,158
to talk about all these different

3196
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:15,658
subjects there's a a wider amount of

3197
02:07:14,158 --> 02:07:16,920
people out there who just want to hear

3198
02:07:15,658 --> 02:07:18,839
truth

3199
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:20,639
you know or they want to hear versions

3200
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,480
of stories or this or that or whatever

3201
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:23,400
else

3202
02:07:21,479 --> 02:07:24,658
and I think we do Matt and I think it's

3203
02:07:23,399 --> 02:07:25,979
really important to get that kind of

3204
02:07:24,658 --> 02:07:27,960
stuff out there

3205
02:07:25,979 --> 02:07:29,399
but you're always dancing this line

3206
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:31,439
about like

3207
02:07:29,399 --> 02:07:33,539
you know what's public what's private

3208
02:07:31,439 --> 02:07:35,698
what's yeah you know what's what's

3209
02:07:33,539 --> 02:07:37,139
appropriate to be said

3210
02:07:35,698 --> 02:07:38,819
you know

3211
02:07:37,139 --> 02:07:41,699
um you know what history is pertinent

3212
02:07:38,819 --> 02:07:43,319
and what's more salacious yeah you know

3213
02:07:41,698 --> 02:07:45,319
yeah and then you get people that want

3214
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:48,599
to just drive the narrative in a way

3215
02:07:45,319 --> 02:07:51,359
that is what we cut what we consider to

3216
02:07:48,599 --> 02:07:53,699
be inaccurate but benefits them

3217
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:55,319
yeah and so we fight against pushback

3218
02:07:53,698 --> 02:07:57,479
yeah

3219
02:07:55,319 --> 02:08:00,359
well we both you know we appreciate you

3220
02:07:57,479 --> 02:08:02,519
both very much and I think over time it

3221
02:08:00,359 --> 02:08:05,098
becomes more and more obvious to people

3222
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:08,940
um just how complex

3223
02:08:05,099 --> 02:08:11,579
um and scary uh some of these politics

3224
02:08:08,939 --> 02:08:12,539
can get what I will say in addition to

3225
02:08:11,579 --> 02:08:15,238
that

3226
02:08:12,539 --> 02:08:16,319
is that for all the bull for all the

3227
02:08:15,238 --> 02:08:19,019
bull

3228
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:20,399
it does make me think that some of what

3229
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:22,920
we say matters

3230
02:08:20,399 --> 02:08:24,299
it does and that we are having an impact

3231
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:26,279
on people

3232
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:27,779
and that people are nervous about our

3233
02:08:26,279 --> 02:08:29,399
impact

3234
02:08:27,779 --> 02:08:31,500
you know

3235
02:08:29,399 --> 02:08:33,960
um because if it was if we were totally

3236
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:35,880
irrelevant it wouldn't matter

3237
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:36,779
yeah there would just be words in the

3238
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:39,599
Wind

3239
02:08:36,779 --> 02:08:42,000
no and we're growing and growing big

3240
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:44,639
time well I mean it's just you know it's

3241
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,679
it's uh it's it's a lot of

3242
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:48,560
like what's funny about it is that I'm a

3243
02:08:46,679 --> 02:08:50,940
naturally diplomatic person

3244
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:52,500
and so it's like people get mad

3245
02:08:50,939 --> 02:08:55,319
sometimes people get real mad at me

3246
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:58,319
about certain things and I'm like man

3247
02:08:55,319 --> 02:08:59,698
what if I just want to just just vented

3248
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:01,559
it all out

3249
02:08:59,698 --> 02:09:02,759
you know I learned a long time ago a lot

3250
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:04,980
of people think I'm just completely

3251
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:07,739
unfiltered and just say everything no

3252
02:09:04,979 --> 02:09:10,079
