00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,179
welcome to breeders Syndicate the only

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,939
cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,739
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,599
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,579
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,379
cookies

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,239
we're the traditional Market

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,679
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,738
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,799
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,140
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,280
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,280
this is the revolution

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,679
what's up everyone so welcome to

27
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,640
um I guess what we're calling legit Or

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,780
Nah which is the review section that

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,420
we're going to be doing going to

30
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,340
different collectives and getting like

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,719
not necessarily old school strains but

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,560
strains

33
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,319
predating the cookies era and

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,900
seeing if if modern day collectives have

35
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,779
what they claim to have in flower

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,900
because a lot of people that have have

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,118
that are tuning in even or are new to

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,118
Growing never experienced a lot of these

39
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,159
clones and are relying on their data and

40
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,680
their input

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,020
to be from these places

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,460
where they get their where they get

43
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,500
their opinions to base their judgments

44
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,539
on these strains right

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,239
um this is where they maybe go get their

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,340
clones if it's a you know a clone

47
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,560
Nursery flower place you know those

48
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,439
places I think still exist right

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,939
so I I thought it would be kind of

50
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,339
interesting to do this

51
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,039
um you know I've I've also been doing

52
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,320
reviews on stuff that is modern because

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,780
I've stayed away from it for so long

54
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,659
and I you know it used to be when people

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,860
would ask me that I just be like oh

56
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:15,419
like I don't care you know but um

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,340
yeah I guess

58
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,738
there comes a point of where like I need

59
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,360
to know because now I've isolated myself

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,680
from that part of the community for so

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,840
long that really I just don't know

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,200
anymore like past gelato I just been

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,620
like I don't care but I need to care

64
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:34,019
because I can't give valid input or

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,180
anything on it other than it has cookies

66
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,379
in it maybe it sucks you know and and

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,760
that's not always going to be the case

68
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,759
and as I'm learning through these

69
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,500
reviews so without further ado

70
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,378
one of the first things I wanted to

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,759
check when I went to any Collective was

72
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,919
OG Kush

73
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,739
I wanted to see

74
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:56,219
first I get a lot of messages from

75
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,739
people uh that are that are newer

76
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,840
Growers and they ask like what's the

77
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,700
best OG cushy line I've never tried a

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,560
pure OG Kush and I want to experience it

79
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,419
I want to have you know a good data

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,239
point for it

81
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:12,179
and I you know for me OG Kush has been

82
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,158
around so long that it's almost like uh

83
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,920
second nature thing to know what OG Kush

84
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,899
is and I I tend to explain stuff oh it's

85
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,299
kind of OG cushy you know like assuming

86
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,080
everybody knows what that is

87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,540
um

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,000
when it comes to OG Kush of course there

89
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,098
were a lot of old clones so Louis OG is

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,620
one of the old classic ones coming out

91
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:33,299
of La probably an OG Kush back seat is

92
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,519
best as best anyone can tell it doesn't

93
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,379
seem to be if it's a hybrid it's so OG

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,560
Kush dominant that

95
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:44,280
um you don't see any at least I don't

96
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,860
see any of the um other parents traits

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,439
if it's a hybrid you know

98
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,680
um to me it's just a classic classic

99
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,579
version of an LA OG Kush

100
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,500
um

101
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,360
our buddy bitter still holds the cut

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,098
resin lung held the cut for a long time

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
passed it to me pass it to bitters so

104
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,479
it's still in our group

105
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,119
and um it's something that you know we

106
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,598
can smoke flour of from the original cut

107
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,158
still so it's also a good reason I

108
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,658
wanted to choose Louis OG it's something

109
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:14,818
that we still have access to the flower

110
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:15,840
something I'm very familiar with very

111
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,899
familiar with

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,620
and with this it's kind of giving people

113
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,918
some wiggle room too like um this is a

114
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,439
review of uh fto which is free trade

115
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,779
Organics or just one of the many

116
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,759
companies that sells locally here I

117
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,219
think they're from LA but they probably

118
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:39,240
drive it up to Bakersfield or whatever

119
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:42,180
um it says small batch Exotics so that's

120
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,079
how you know it's dank it says exotic

121
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,400
um that's a joke that's sarcasm for

122
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,019
all of you

123
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,000
um

124
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:54,359
yeah it's it's it gives a little wiggle

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,360
room because OG Kush is OG Kush like

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,240
as long as it's a really good OG

127
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,340
it can look like a good faithful

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,500
representation of what Louis can express

129
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:07,319
so it can almost fly under the radar

130
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,120
even if it's not exactly it

131
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,680
it can hit close enough to where it's

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,560
splitting hairs that's what's beautiful

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,740
about OG Kush right so I want to see

134
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,780
essentially if they have a really decent

135
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,900
old-school OG Kush so whether this is

136
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,939
truly Louis or not I could really care

137
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:28,560
less I want to see if they're offering a

138
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:30,839
decent representation of old OG Kush and

139
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,478
um yeah on their label they actually

140
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,279
list it as

141
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,099
I don't know if it's too

142
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:42,299
King Louis OG

143
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:45,060
and indica so you know and there's the

144
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,000
uh code you could probably scan it from

145
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,038
this if you want to I don't know if that

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,060
helps them in any way but hopefully it

147
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:52,019
does

148
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,339
um

149
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:59,219
so first off I'll talk about the flower

150
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,560
um yeah I'll show some pictures here

151
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,620
probably gonna make it get like pushed

152
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,079
into mature audiences which whatever

153
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,360
um I was not necessarily impressed with

154
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,359
the look of the flower

155
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,719
um the texture felt or the look of it I

156
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,240
should say the look of it looked like it

157
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,740
had been handled a lot if that makes

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
sense and it'll look like it'd be

159
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,639
handled a lot

160
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,019
you know by someone wearing gloves like

161
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,418
I could tell what that looks like it

162
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:30,418
almost makes the blood look more oily

163
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:32,758
because the the resin is being kind of

164
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:34,019
it's been handled right and that's how

165
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,460
it looks and you can see from the

166
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,139
pictures

167
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,978
um that I'm posting I don't know where

168
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,840
it's going to insert it probably

169
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:42,300
somewhere yeah

170
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,339
um but yeah

171
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,819
it wasn't impressive looking so when I

172
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:51,179
opened this up I was like man

173
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:52,560
man okay well I'm probably gonna be you

174
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,720
know I figured it was just going to be

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,240
as expected for a dispensary experience

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:04,680
like just low end grow mid Z oh gee

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:09,180
but I will say I will say

178
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,180
I was pleasantly surprised

179
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,580
looks can be deceiving

180
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,259
definitely looks can be deceiving and

181
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:18,779
obviously they were the bottoms of the

182
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,960
bottoms of the bags not much love given

183
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,159
to them they were manhandled but

184
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,978
um

185
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,520
it did it did have some good qualities

186
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:31,439
then I'm gonna um I've already smoked it

187
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,478
done all that but I'm going to try to

188
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,779
see if I can bring up anything else

189
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,918
right now while I have it here and since

190
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,939
I'm going to be doing these reviews and

191
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,560
it's the first video I'll talk about

192
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,418
what I'm using to do the review since

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,439
this is important too

194
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:49,439
um I have my C2 that beautiful breeder

195
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:53,459
Syndicate Edition

196
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:56,279
um C2 Custom Creations pipe and then I

197
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,538
have of course my ash catcher my lovely

198
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,399
Ash kit I should have cleaned the bowl

199
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,918
but it was pretty fresh

200
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,500
um my ash catcher from C2 I love this

201
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,538
thing the easiest ash catcher I've ever

202
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,579
cleaned

203
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:10,139
and you should have your [ __ ] you know

204
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:13,379
pretty clean at least clean your water

205
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:16,319
right so you can flavor or whatnot

206
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:19,319
and um then I have

207
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,539
for the second way because that was of

208
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,460
course combustion method because you're

209
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:26,459
only going to get so many flavors that

210
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,318
way and frankly the high is less complex

211
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,680
than um

212
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,259
using what I call the or not what I call

213
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,099
what is called

214
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:41,099
the rip tick rip master

215
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:44,700
it is a vaporizing wand

216
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,519
that there's a hole in the bottom here

217
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,940
and there's this rubber gasket that

218
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,480
seals to the bowl and then there's holes

219
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,779
on each side in each direction that make

220
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,060
this the air kind of spin up through

221
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:03,299
something like that the heat goes

222
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,399
through it it works and honestly I you

223
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,799
know I've owned volcanoes like really

224
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,740
nice volcanoes and I've given them all

225
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:14,479
away uh after getting this because I

226
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,459
really think this is the most perfect

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,899
smoking device for me for me in my

228
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:23,219
opinion for me to evaluate high and

229
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,139
flavor

230
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,660
nothing's more accurate for me it

231
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:30,059
doesn't just go popcorn you know you get

232
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:30,659
full ranges of experience

233
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:32,518
um

234
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:34,379
if you've never smoked blueberry through

235
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,159
one of these things I highly recommend

236
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,539
it

237
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,338
when I say blueberry I mean real

238
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,480
blueberry you know blueberry tastes like

239
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,899
blueberries

240
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,240
which is I guess rare unless you're

241
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,500
having fun stuff of course

242
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,159
anyway

243
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:54,539
I also wanted to give like a um a less

244
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:57,958
less experienced smokers take so I'm

245
00:09:54,539 --> 00:10:00,778
having Brynn kind of my my lady chime in

246
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,639
on some of this she she's she smoked

247
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,919
most of her life but it's always been on

248
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,120
and off and once we met like she never

249
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,879
paid attention

250
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,500
any care for strains or you know of

251
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,958
course most people don't most people

252
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,639
don't so once she met me she got you

253
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,000
know introduced to the weird world of

254
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,199
giving it crap about strains and all the

255
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,100
weirdness that comes along with that and

256
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,379
the complexities and um slowly I've been

257
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,879
trying to get her you know to try these

258
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,759
different things or remember what's what

259
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,458
What She Likes what helps with what and

260
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,679
I got some of her input on the smell

261
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,899
taste high as well

262
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,599
and I found it kind of interesting

263
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,600
because usually we experience things so

264
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,519
different like I smell blueberry and

265
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,259
she'll say ooh peppery you know or

266
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,720
that's bright

267
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,519
sharp like different words that I like

268
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,100
don't work for me when I describe smell

269
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,139
she she's an artist so she she has a

270
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,860
whole different way of thinking and she

271
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:01,500
she thinks in terms of like color

272
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,500
texture it's it's very unique when it

273
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,240
came to um the Louie this was her input

274
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,278
the smell she said it smelled like

275
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,620
someone with bad breasts wished lemon

276
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,860
floor cleaner which

277
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,959
I mean that's fairly accurate like I get

278
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,579
lemon floor cleaner too so

279
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,679
yeah the Ben Brett thing I would

280
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:22,439
associate more GMO but

281
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,000
like whenever she smells GMO she just

282
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,640
goes

283
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,200
you know like

284
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,059
like she wants nothing to do with that

285
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,519
so this one she does this is she

286
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,559
actually really really likes this

287
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,839
um case coated my tongue like the syrupy

288
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,159
stickiness of lemon heads which I

289
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,220
thought was awesome and hella

290
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,259
descriptive and the high

291
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,980
calms me down enough to focus but

292
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,578
doesn't put me to sleep with no anxiety

293
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,800
um

294
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:51,838
or it doesn't put me to sleep and it has

295
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,759
no anxiety

296
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,600
um enough that I was able to sit down

297
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,578
and read 12 chapters which her sitting

298
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,759
for longer than five minutes is an

299
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:04,500
insane idea and um

300
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,838
it's it's getting her to the point where

301
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,159
she can sit and focus and read which is

302
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,560
great for her

303
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:14,399
um so yeah I don't know like

304
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,139
hopefully maybe some of you you guys out

305
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,879
there your ladies may take some input

306
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,919
from that if they're not like is super

307
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,320
into this and as dorky as we are about

308
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,599
it like maybe that might resonate with

309
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,920
them some more I'm not sure but I wanted

310
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,180
to bring that in because I thought it

311
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,299
was really interesting how much it

312
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:34,679
aligned with me so I'm a sparkle Bowl

313
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:37,939
and uh I'll tell you what I what I taste

314
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,939
uh dream combustion method

315
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,759
so like I said

316
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:09,539
looks can be deceiving

317
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,220
this has exceptional old

318
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:15,419
traditional

319
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,579
mouth coding OG Kush flavor it's exactly

320
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,219
like I would have wanted

321
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:22,919
um I've gotten other ogs from

322
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,720
collectives even the same same place I

323
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,299
ordered from which was called Highway 99

324
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,920
collective in Bakersfield they were

325
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,259
offering a marzo gene it was going to be

326
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:32,219
the first review but I felt that it was

327
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,319
such a

328
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,660
piss poor representation of Mars

329
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,420
that I didn't like smoking it and it

330
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,719
just got kicked to the side like it was

331
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:48,259
that bad I was super unimpressed with it

332
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,440
this

333
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:54,480
while it was it's obviously not the best

334
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,200
grow of it

335
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,959
um

336
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,060
I shouldn't say that it's not the best

337
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,439
handling of it it might have been an

338
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,119
amazing I think it was probably a really

339
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,019
good grow because the flavor's there I

340
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,820
think it was probably not the best

341
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,639
manhandling of it

342
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,480
but the uh flavors there the highs there

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,700
it's got a nice relaxing

344
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,860
anxiety-free OG kushai because OG Kush

345
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,480
tends to be anti-anxiety for me it's not

346
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,820
always for everyone

347
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,100
um but it is for me but the most

348
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,139
important thing is that Flora cleaner

349
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,278
mouth coating

350
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,440
um

351
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,059
lemon floor cleaner I guess is the the

352
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,060
best way to put it Pledge some people go

353
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,799
pledge some people go like soapy like

354
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:36,719
floor cleaner to me is soapy so I often

355
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,458
use soapy to describe it but floor

356
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,920
cleaners furniture polish is more

357
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:44,338
accurate Maybe

358
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,620
um if it doesn't have that to me it's

359
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,480
really hard for me to call it a good OG

360
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,339
Kush because that's what I want out of

361
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,379
it that's how I feel OG Kush expresses

362
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,660
best now there's people who feed it

363
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:58,078
heavily you know get OG Kush to be more

364
00:14:54,659 --> 00:15:00,958
earthy smell more fuely gas but when I

365
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:03,539
when I get OG

366
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,698
I want furniture polish like this I want

367
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,458
to I want it mouth coating it needs to

368
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:10,379
be completely unique you need to know

369
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,778
that's OG Kush

370
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:15,659
um there's plenty of things that that

371
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:18,179
aren't OG Kush that are earthy uh kind

372
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:21,059
of cushy you know but that don't have

373
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:24,179
the furniture polish aspects to it

374
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,979
anyway so that's that's it for the uh

375
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,620
the flavor portion of the combustion

376
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,600
overall

377
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,220
it tastes like OG Kush should when it's

378
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,680
combusted

379
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,720
but there is a whole nother level you

380
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,479
can take something

381
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,860
when you use

382
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,159
vaporization techniques especially Vapor

383
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,879
wands heat wands

384
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,799
um

385
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,899
you know I I

386
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,519
I'm not sponsored by these guys at all

387
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,259
you know like everything's been bought

388
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,440
and paid for from them this was actually

389
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:56,819
a gift from my buddy Iris back in the

390
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,920
day he was the first person to turn me

391
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,899
onto this and I I made fun of him

392
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,778
thought it was his uh anal torture

393
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,100
device I still think it is

394
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:07,078
um

395
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,659
you know we all use it for that at times

396
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,239
but it works great for for this too it

397
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:15,299
also doubles and works great for this

398
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,180
um but I do think that the uh

399
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:21,359
the design could be improved on a bit

400
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:23,638
and um it's really hard to get a hold of

401
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,560
now these things which is a shame so

402
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,560
hopefully and I know some people are

403
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:30,239
working on some new wands because these

404
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,638
these things are that good so we'll see

405
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,440
what comes in the future but for now we

406
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,440
are using the rip Tech and I highly

407
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,079
highly recommend any one devices if you

408
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,300
want to experience flavor and the high

409
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,638
complexity of any strain

410
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:47,419
so I'm going to give this a go with the

411
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,419
oh Louie

412
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:52,500
and with these you want to let it kind

413
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,919
of heat up for a second and then you

414
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:59,179
draw in really slow

415
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,179
like it's like it's your dad

416
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,438
and there's a world of flavor and OG

417
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,439
Kush that unless you vaporize it you

418
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,500
won't experience there's like candy

419
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:35,360
there's a like a Lemonheads candy in

420
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,359
there that is super sweet

421
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,339
citrus

422
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,339
almost an orange

423
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:47,759
the complexity is so far away from the

424
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:50,879
the harsh tones of gassy fuel

425
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,798
and what we expect from that it's just a

426
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,380
world apart

427
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,139
and uh yeah

428
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,419
this this is this is definitely whatever

429
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,000
cut they have is an old OG Kush cut

430
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:06,059
whatever it is and I dig it and I'm glad

431
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,400
that at least some people you know if

432
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:11,700
they got lucky enough to

433
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,620
um by Bud from this cut they've got to

434
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,620
experience OG kush here locally recently

435
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,249
[Music]

436
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:44,940
foreign

437
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:46,799
there's something indescribable

438
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,720
about the flavors you can get out of

439
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,000
vaping there's something that runs

440
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,298
through all of them

441
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,119
that I think is uh

442
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:58,918
probably just the flavor of cannabis in

443
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,739
general

444
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,200
but it's super Pleasant and and I never

445
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,419
experienced this with the volcano

446
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,100
I never experienced this with any of

447
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,700
those devices

448
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:13,079
um

449
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:15,720
my friend Warren brought a stores pickle

450
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:18,538
like portable thing but he had this

451
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,839
device attachment on top of it it looked

452
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:24,419
almost like a puffco or a Carta type top

453
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,399
it's more like a card I type top

454
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,400
and it was bigger

455
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,559
and with that you're able to get some

456
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,700
pretty good flavors that were were

457
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,619
similar

458
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,200
to what I saw with the rip Tech it's the

459
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,538
closest I've seen closest but it still

460
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,140
had some of the popcorn stuff

461
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:42,960
um

462
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,080
but it was close it was close but this

463
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,538
is a Next Level and for the um the piece

464
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,460
we were using for the rip Tech is

465
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,679
another C2 and this one's a double

466
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,419
ratchet they actually talk about this in

467
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,059
the C2 episode that we did recently

468
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:59,340
season nine episode one

469
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:03,720
um it got stuck into the mature section

470
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:04,798
you know for the adults so go check that

471
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,079
out

472
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,240
um what else do I gotta get in here uh

473
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,399
go check out our Discord patreon I'm

474
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,240
gonna try to do more of these

475
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,559
um

476
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,380
but yeah if you have access to ftos

477
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,899
King Louie

478
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,840
like I said this specific batch looked

479
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,120
like someone maybe

480
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:30,058
handsies it up a little bit too much

481
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:33,239
um but it's not bad it's not bad I don't

482
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:36,538
regret it I regret the Mars OG I regret

483
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,400
that I fully regret that I don't regret

484
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:39,779
this so

485
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,600
um shout out to them they did a great

486
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:44,639
job with the um growing of it really

487
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,139
good job with the flavor

488
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
um high is great

489
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,280
and uh overall it was a pretty good

490
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,859
value too I mean I think they're

491
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,139
charging 35 and eighth which is probably

492
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,639
standard for nowadays I don't know I

493
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,600
don't know what people charge for for

494
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,880
weed now but uh it wasn't uh I'm not mad

495
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,678
at it you know what I mean like I was

496
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,320
mad when I looked at it but I wasn't mad

497
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,720
after and that's what counts so anyway

498
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,460
that will be it for this Edition you're

499
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,038
