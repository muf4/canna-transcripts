00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,359
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,879
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,099
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,900
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,059
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,419
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,140
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,699
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,439
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,219
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,219
to the underground

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,539
you'll notice with a lot of our

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,979
interviews it kind of just jumps into a

20
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,500
conversation and this will be no

21
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,558
different and the ending will probably

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,719
be no different as well so

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,099
um apologies in advance a lot of our

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,820
conversations are all over the place

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,899
it's a bunch of us with ADHD so uh yeah

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,119
I just wanted to put that in there

27
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,739

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,960
we are here with New York Pete

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,618
um was the I guess you would say owner

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,739
Runner of compassion clubs in the um in

34
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:25,140
the 90s in Canada correct yeah and we're

35
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,699
still going so I I started the uh

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,819
originally it was called the London

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,820
Compassion Club uh back in 95

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,299
um

39
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:40,200
and then

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,259
um we went public in with Allen Rock so

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,920
that would have been like

42
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:48,900
97 or so and that's um that's when I uh

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,640
split off from hemp nation and did the

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,520
organic traveler which was my retail but

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,299
they call me NYPD just because my name

81
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:33,000
have uh we I've always lived in the gray

82
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,378
area of the world and sometimes it's

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,800
really dark gray and sometimes it's

84
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:40,079
really light gray right like you know

85
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,580
I've uh I've had a deal in the black

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,080
market because I needed to to suffice or

87
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,480
to satisfy the need of the medical

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,099
community that I was part of and I

89
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,840
couldn't grow enough for everybody so

90
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,158
um and that's really really why I

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,400
started growing pot I started growing

92
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,739
pot you know one not to sell it I just

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,200
wanted to save money and when I started

94
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,080
organic traveler uh in a you know

95
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,899
University Town I had the uh grow your

96
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,239
tuition Campaign which was uh I would

97
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,219
sell you seeds and give you information

98
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,959

100
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,000
chats and

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,339
um

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,819
walk you through how to do cuttings or

103
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,939
start seeds or or stuff like that

104
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:29,399
um because money in your pocket whether

105
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,620
you save it or make it is still money in

106
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,839
your pocket right yeah no don't get into

107
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,500
this industry and I [ __ ] honestly you

108
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,299
know I I won't work with anybody

109
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,478
back in the day especially when cannabis

110
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,780
was illegal if your sole income was

111
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,758
strictly on growing pot

112
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:51,299
good on you you you're not going to be

113
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,460
in my circle because I think you know if

114
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,460
you're doing that's kind of prostituting

115
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,198
the uh the plant and I've always been a

116
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,359
good big advocate

117
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,040
about you know not prostituting this

118
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,139
plant like use it for what it's meant

119
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,340
for right like it was put forth for us

120
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:12,960
to enjoy not to you know uh pasteurize

121
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:15,060
and and prostitute kind of thing so I've

122
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,359
made my entire living off of cannabis

123
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,639
yes but I also had organic traveler

124

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,660
generational thing too because like when

167
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,279
I I felt like where I you know where I

168
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,620
grew up at least it was really important

169
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,439
to have some kind of

170
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,720
um verifiable income yeah right because

171
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,759
you had to have some reason of existing

172
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,840
you had to have some way to make it you

173
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
didn't want to go to court and they're

174
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,098
like how do you support yourself and

175
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,979
you're like uh right and you know it

176
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:29,399
comes from an era where like you it had

177
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:31,439
to be a side gig because you know you

178
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,060
needed even if it was just a even if it

179
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,160
was just a front like you said like you

180
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,439
had no like organic traveler was all a

181
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,660
front like I mean I [ __ ] never made

182
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,120
money do at organic travel I lost it

183
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,580
when it got to a point of losing about

184
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,680
40 Grand a year I said okay we're

185
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,139
pulling the plug and now by that time

186
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,840
you know I was doing the compassion

187
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,120
Society for

188
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,939
like 20 years

189
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,478
the cops knew what I was doing you know

190
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:03,060
and then you know in Diva came into play

191
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,240
and Diva came in into play

192
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:09,478
as I was close and organic like I I same

193
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,500
thing CRA I had to read

194
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:17,038
and you you kind of need to have

195
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,500
um a reason for like you said what

196
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,120
people see but for me it's for what I

197
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,579
see and what I know

198
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,120
and I I cut ties with some really

199
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:29,279
[ __ ] great Growers and uh and I cut

200
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,459
ties with people that were just [ __ ]

201
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:35,579
[ __ ] you know and it was just

202
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,918
um their focus was money money money and

203
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,158
when you chase it you know you're

204
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,538
opening yourself up to the you're more

205
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,879
vulnerable to be taken advantage of or

206
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:47,580
get busted or you know get Shady deal

207
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,980
with Shady people [ __ ] like that I've

208
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,200
been pretty lucky I mean what I've been

209
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,778
in this industry

210
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,600
um [ __ ] long time 30

211
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:01,139
how old am I 30 40.

212
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,820
40 almost about 35 years you know and I

213
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,220
thought that I put my name out there and

214
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,620
said hey I'm a [ __ ] pot guy kind of

215
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,660
thing yeah and London London is a pretty

216
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,940
conservative place like it was totally

217
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,338
different than like that's why most

218
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,380
people went to BC because everybody left

219
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,180
BC and that's why I say like they'd be

220
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,980
like oh BC grows the best part of course

221
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,559
they do they're from Ontario like [ __ ]

222
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,120
you know like I went out to BC I lived

223
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,639
out there and I didn't meet anybody from

224
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,679
[ __ ] BC kind of thing right yeah I'm

225
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,600
out there on grow contracts but you know

226
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,639
it was um

227
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,560
what we have here I mean it seems like

228
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,539
it it kind of

229
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,479
I think the marijuana movement started

230
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:43,860
around here and yes and we are in a very

231
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:47,100
uh conservative uh town and back when I

232
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:50,639
started we had a very conservative uh

233
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,040
religious mayor and uh you know I wanted

234
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,720
to make a point I put up big banners

235
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,480
that said the Lord believes in marijuana

236
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,300
do you believe in the Lord you know and

237
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,240
it was not something that she took

238
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,439
kindly but would not you know

239
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,480
um

240
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,600
make us think about it because she would

241
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,100
be giving me AirPlay but yeah more clock

242
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,899
in the morning the [ __ ] Paddy Wagon

243
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,800
showed up and took down my [ __ ]

244
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,019
Banner

245
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,759
you know and that's the thing like

246
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,740
you've been doing this a long time and

247
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,799
and all of that but like the one thing

248
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:27,000
you've been doing also is like fighting

249
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,559
the law openly right like since what

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,620
since 93

251
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,359
you've been constantly more like I think

252
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,200
is when the Constitutional challenges

253
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,200
yeah

254
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:45,120
on a regular basis right like he's uh

255
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,278
that poor man has been beat the [ __ ] up

256
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,820
in this [ __ ] industry too who is he

257
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,278
uh Alan Young is the uh I say the

258
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,420
Cannabis lawyer in Canada so

259
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,939
um

260
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:59,458
um and so he's the one that handled uh

261
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,459
Chris's case uh his partner Paul

262
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:04,578
Bernstein he handled like Ross roll a

263

big doobie whatever the [ __ ] his name is

264
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:09,479
if you go to the West Coast you have

265
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:11,278
John Conroy when you hear constitutional

266
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,240
lawyers uh you're dealing with Alan

267
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,759
Young

268
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,860
do you want to explain the the whole uh

269
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:22,980
Chris Clay arrest

270
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:26,159
uh sure yeah so uh I was part of NPC but

271
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,440
in the shadows uh luckily so the first

272
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,659
time he got raided

273
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,620
um

274
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:38,458
it was uh yeah so with with Chris very

275
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,200
educated well read polite kid who didn't

276
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,000
start smoking pot till just a few years

277
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,519
prior

278
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,679
um read the law and the law

279
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,240
the way that the law was read is it

280
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,578
wasn't cannabis that was illegal it was

281
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,299
THC yeah so

282
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:56,759
THC is not in the seeds that's correct

283
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,919
we started selling seeds and that's how

284
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,519
I met them because I was going back and

285
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:05,219
forth from New York to Saint Thomas or

286
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,200
London because I was in college and I

287
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,440
was bringing seeds back and forth Just

288
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,600
trading for genetics for genetics yeah

289
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,660
and so I was helping him with the the

290
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,040
little uh Great Canadian Emporium seed

291
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:22,319
[ __ ] company and then he realized

292
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,599
well cuttings don't have [ __ ] THC in

293
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,778
them either so he took out a [ __ ]

294
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,320
full-page ad in the uh see I think we've

295
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:33,958
seen magazine that said uh overgrow your

296
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,420
government and I I'm pretty sure that

297
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,000
Chris well it would have been Andrew who

298
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:41,278
was the artist coined that phrase the

299
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,899
overgrow overgrow your government right

300
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,360
less overall the government and it was

301
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,759
like it was literally a cartoon of a

302
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,159
seed marching with a helmet on with the

303
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,179
hemp Nation flag on it holding a bong at

304
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:57,860
like it's a gun and you know and we said

305
00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:01,859
we're gonna sell 30 skunk one cuttings

306
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:04,259
for 30 bucks or 25 for 25 bucks or

307
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,120
something like that and um

308
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,480
I think by

309
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,560
the seventh cutting or something along

310
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,480
that line uh Jordan who's the

311
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,419
little person I think is a proper name

312
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,620
Howard the Duck yeah he was Howard oh

313
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,319
that guy okay what are you talking about

314
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,320
yeah so he uh I just reconnected with

315
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,879
him too he's back in Toronto and um so

316
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,060
they read he was the one that actually

317
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,879
sold the cutting to an undercover cop

318
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,319
they must have brought or the duck sold

319
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,439
the cutting to an undercover cop yeah

320
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,240
yeah that's why he was arrested right so

321
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,820
Prince was arrested because he was the

322
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,399
owner it was his name on the lease yeah

323
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,040
and uh Jordan got arrested because he

324
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
was the actual one that did the um the

325
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,000
sale

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,220
and um

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,419
and uh and yes but they must have bought

328
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,980
the cutting and then brought it down

329
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:58,919
because they didn't buy it and then bust

330
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,440

331
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:03,539
little bit later I mean Chris would be

332
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,100
the better ask this I mean I was smoking

333
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,078

336
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,019
Jordan was like a little person but he

337
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,720
had dreads down to his ass he had like a

338
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:21,060
lip piercing you know he was yeah he was

339
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,820
uh he was uh that still trips me out

340
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:26,578
Howard the Duck bro he was only Howard

341
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,778
for like a very split yeah they tried to

342
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:28,759
remove a lot of it because he was

343
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:31,200
underage

344
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,179
I watched a documentary on it the other

345
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,519
day on the making of Howard the Duck it

346
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:38,479
was probably yeah they don't mention him

347
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,500
do they yeah oh yeah yeah

348
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,839
like they had hired him and he was a

349
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,399
little kid and yeah like they initially

350
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,620
shot a bunch of it with him but the

351
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,720
movements from the dummy they had to

352
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,240
move it remove them yeah but he didn't

353
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,339
tell if it was him or not because as you

354
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,860
know if you can you actually email me

355
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,899
that uh oh yeah yeah definitely kind of

356
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,759
it's way worth watching he was in

357
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,278
something modern too with like Colin

358
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,659

getting back to the bus

382
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,360
they they must have took the plant out

383
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,039
brought it they couldn't have analyzed

384
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,100

385
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,639
Cannabis and came back later that uh

386
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,379
afternoon and raided the place yeah we

of uh controlled substance or back to

393
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,559
echin it would be called something

394
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,919
different back then I don't know if it

395
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:26,638
was a PPT like the uh possession for the

396
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,979
purpose but um anyways they you know

397

cleared out the store [ __ ] made a

398
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,519
mess of it basically tried to shut them

399
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,800
down and

400
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,899
um maybe they didn't realize Chris had

401
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,419
really supportive parents that had money

402
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:43,259
and believed their son not to be a

403
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,919
[ __ ] criminal like he was treated and

404
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,778
um

405
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,539
and

406
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:50,939
the Elmwood house we had a grow house on

407
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:52,259
Elmwood that everybody lived in except

408
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,259
for me because I actually I was

409
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,039
delivering meat at the time and

410
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,560
um

411
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:01,500
and you know they went there that's

412
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,879
where they busted Prozac and uh his

413
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,019
girlfriend at the time

414
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,939
and uh that was [ __ ] a [ __ ] show of

415
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,939
craziness because as soon as the cops

416
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,500
busted us the phone calls started going

417
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,880
everybody that was at the house was

418
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,519
literally like running to the basement

419
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,260
grabbing pots running out the backyard

420
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,418
throwing them Over The Back Fence into

421
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,578
an empty lot so by the time the police

422
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,559
got there there was literally a trail of

423
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:28,019
dirt up the stairs through the kitchen

424
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,899
out the back door and dirt still on the

425
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,160
top of the fence I bet yeah throwing it

426
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,620
over and they were just like they were

427
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,058
like yep not on the property not our

428
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,739
problems you know so um so that that was

429
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,319
the first bust

430
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,380
and then since they didn't say anything

431
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,538
about the the seeds Chris and Chris and

432
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:52,860

uh NPC wasn't even around at this point

463
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,959
in time so as far as I knew

464
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,579
yeah Chris Chris was the first one to

465
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,600

466
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,259

to to spread the word right like to

469
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:22,679
overgrow the government so you know and

470
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,599
when they busted him the first time

471
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,640
they uh

472
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,119
they didn't do anything about the seeds

473
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,640
so we figured [ __ ] you know we we know

474
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,959
where the limits are so [ __ ] yeah the

Spreading the seeds [ __ ] everywhere

478
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,600
you know and we started that's when I

479
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:44,819
was hired to work in the store

480
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,279

483
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:56,639
NYPD yeah and uh and um

484
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:59,099
it was a uh

485
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,059
it was the point that you know we

486
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,579
started

487
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:05,160
getting noticed and we would start

488
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:06,418
getting people traveling to us and then

489
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,820
Chris

490
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,759
got on the internet and everything back

491
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:15,298
then was raw code and started producing

492
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,700
the uh seed menu online

493
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,339
yeah and it was [ __ ] it we were getting

494
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,860
more hits at one point if I remember

495
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:25,379
correctly he said we were getting more

496
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:28,319
hits than University of Western Ontario

497
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,539
that's funny I believe it right because

498
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,759
we had so many [ __ ] people that just

499
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:34,798
heard what you can buy cannabis seeds

500
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,900
and then you know because we were in the

501
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,000
newspaper sure they're gonna put that in

502
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,880
there so it gives us credibility of who

503
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,759
we are and what we're doing yep and then

504
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,520
uh when they came back the second time

505
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,079
they offered Chris a uh

506
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:54,839
a

507
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:58,678
uh a way out an option is yeah to to

508
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:01,798
um plead guilty to lesser charges and

509
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,460
drop the Constitutional Challenge and

510
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:05,819
um

511
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,319
and basically sell the seed sell the

512
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,200
pipes sell the bongs we don't care about

513
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,579
that you know and Chris came to us and

514
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,319
said it's up to you guys that I mean

515
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:14,819
we're we're a nation at this point in

516
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,220
time we were true we were treating

517
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:19,439
ourselves as a nation so we we had

518
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,940
Minister as minister of Agriculture and

519
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,440
then we had minister of Labor which was

520
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,759
Bill that took care of all the retail

521
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:29,880
store and all the um uh all the staff

522
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,440
and then we had minister of uh education

523
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,860
which was Sarah and she took care of the

524
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,740
library and the museum and uh and stuff

525
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:40,199
like that and Andrew was the Minister of

526
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,480
Defense he was our artist but he was the

527
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,058
angriest

528
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,558
he was he just had he was he's a

529
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:48,480
brilliant he's a school teacher Iran

530
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,119
which scares to share with me now and

531
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,839
his wife owns from Mars which is another

532
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,879
Staple in this town and um

533
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,798
you know so we were set up as a nation

534
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,539
kind of thing we were ready like they

535
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,599
call it as War on Drugs we were going to

536
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:06,658
take it as a War on Drugs so we formed

537
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,879
our nation and we were ready and uh and

538
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,559
this is like with our early 20s kids

539
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,260
right like you're all like in your early

540
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:17,460
20s this was in the 90s still this would

541
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,599
be late 90s okay yeah so we were uh

542
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,880
um

543
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,579
yeah it would have been like mid 90s

544
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,880
actually second time yeah because I

545
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:28,259
opened up organic in 97.

546
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,940
and

547
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,140
um

548
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,679
and we were and Chris has already

549
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,720
banished from Ontario by that time

550
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,860
and the thing was is after the first

551
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,779
raid

552
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,699
like I said we went balls of all to the

553
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,099
with the seat in the seed uh business

554
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,538
and that's when we started again if

555
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,480
you're going through Amsterdam sell it

556
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:50,400
send a seed so I can breed them and I

557
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,798
was doing what

558
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,480
um what the [ __ ] a big douchebag and

559
00:22:52,798 --> 00:23:00,298
uh Amsterdam are you on no no he's he's

560
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,440
a nice douchebag okay

561
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:06,119
um douchebag uh so many uh no yeah but

562
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,360
he's the this is the most famous he

563
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,759
threatened to sue us as Legends for when

564
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,259
we were entering the cup with the uh he

565
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,980
thought

566
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:19,619
Neville fast no no no that and that was

567
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,480
always uh good people but we were using

568
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:24,719
Neville seeds yeah

569
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,500
hey Hank oh yeah so

570
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,659
Hank is the type of [ __ ] guy that

571
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,298
started doing what we were doing but but

572
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:37,020
being a dick about it I would I would

573
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:40,200
openly say Hey listen we got in 20 seeds

574
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:42,119
of skunk one from uh from the dronkers

575
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,019
and

576
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:48,239
I'm open breeding those and in the same

577
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:49,980
room we had an original Haze we had a

578
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,919
black domino we had all these other

579
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,599
strains so they're f1s this is what

580
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,880
you're gonna get when there's no

581
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,459
guarantees here but

582
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,220
you got your grown pot you know now

583
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,019
you're officially a pot grower and uh

584
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,058
they're they're good genetics they're

585
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:09,418
not you know from where I started my

586
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:12,119
genetic uh selection was from bags of

587
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:14,400
weed yeah you'd get [ __ ] and New York

588
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,899
we're not getting the [ __ ] best weed

589
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,580
we're getting [ __ ] Jamaican brick

590
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,740
like when I first started

591
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:22,379
we would buy nickel bags in East

592
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,099
Rockaway on B15 which I think is

593
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,679
actually in a Beastie Boys song but um

594
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:31,139
for five bucks for a nickel bag and ten

595
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,538
bucks for a dime bag and we would get

596
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,880
you know a third of it with seed it was

597
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:38,220
back when it was after people were

598
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,080
saying buying it by the lid right

599
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,600
there's like four fingers in a [ __ ]

600
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,939
you know in a sandwich bag yeah but we

601
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,918
were basically going and buying nickel

602
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,860
bags for

603
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,780
five bucks and you would get

604
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,099
a shitload of seeds in it and if it was

605
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:56,819
good pot

606
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,139
I would save the seeds right and I

607
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,700
didn't know what the [ __ ] it was I

608
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,820
didn't know what sativa was or indica

609
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,640
was I mean it's all [ __ ] Jamaican

610
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:07,259
[ __ ] [ __ ] weed or Colombian or or

611
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,538
whatever so when we got certain things

612
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,220
and people like oh it's Acapulco Gold

613
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:13,619
okay well I'm Gonna Keep the [ __ ]

614
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,419
seeds because I've heard that back in

615
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:20,339
the high reading in High Times magazines

616
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:23,100
so I started collecting those genetics

617
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:23,939
and I would bring them up to Canada and

618
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:27,599
I would

619
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:30,120
trade with uh with Chris right and he

620
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,558
would have his seeds from here London is

621
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,019
a [ __ ]

622
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,639
phenomenal place for cannabis for

623
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:38,158
multiple reasons one because we did have

624
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,320
the Perth County conspiracy that was a

625
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,700
lot of the draft Dodgers that came to

626
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,418
Canada

627
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,058
um

628
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,580
didn't want to go too far north and

629
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:51,178
we're right between Buffalo and Detroit

630
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:53,278
and if you look at the uh Geographic we

631
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:56,460
are surrounded by great lakes so we are

632
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:58,500
a glacial runoff that all the minerals

633
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,419
and everything got deposited so our soil

634
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,419
here that's why it was such a large

635
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:06,600
farming Community our soil is [ __ ]

636
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,700
awesome was awesome

637
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,879
right so since we were getting all that

638
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:15,319
uh and we're all grown pot in the fields

639
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,600
in the [ __ ] uh in the corn you know

640
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:20,399
we were growing some great [ __ ] pot

641
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:24,719
and if you got seeds in it which you

642
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,340
would indefinitely uh get something I

643
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,140
was happy as [ __ ] [ __ ] people like

644
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:29,639
pissed off like oh man it's got seasoned

645
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,159
I was like [ __ ] give me this no

646
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,960
that's a score bro

647
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,539
you smell the pot is it worth keeping

648
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,019
you know yeah give me some descriptions

649
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:42,298
grow it out see see if I could grow it

650
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,220
indoors you know

651
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:46,558
um if it came from around here I knew I

652
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,019
can grow it most likely Grow It Outdoors

653
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,418
because there wasn't very many people

654
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:54,480
growing back then if they were they were

655
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,278
using phototrons and uh yeah fluorescent

656
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,400
lightings and [ __ ] like that

657
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:03,839
we will the hid Community really wasn't

658
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:06,240
taking off uh it was in the

659
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:10,740
90s

660
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:14,579
in the early 90s I was having some

661
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,980
local kids go and steal [ __ ] lights

662
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:19,019
from in front of buildings yeah because

663
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,019
there were street lights or something

664
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:24,240
there were metal halides and HPS APS and

665
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:25,980
they were either 400s most likely all

666
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,740
400 there wasn't too many thousand Watts

667
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,679
back then yeah I think 250s and 400s yes

668
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,359
we were trying to um

669
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,919
we were growing pot like I said we were

670
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,199
[ __ ] cockroach we didn't know what we

671
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,240
were growing how we were growing it but

672
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,740
[ __ ] man it's it's a weed they call it

673
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,259
weed for a reason the more you do to it

674
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,298
the more you can [ __ ] it up so let it do

675
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:47,038
its thing give it food give it water

676
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:50,038
give it air

677
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:53,460
she's gonna give you back so

678
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:55,798
um by by bringing some of these Jamaican

679
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,259
strains from New York

680
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:59,940
and which I'm saying Jamaican which I

681
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:05,038
think it's going to be it was it was

682
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,538
brickweed so I knew most likely I should

683
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,179
say I didn't know back then but I

684
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:11,220
learned quickly that you can't grow any

685
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:13,740
of course here right just but we can

686
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,380
grow it indoors uh people didn't like it

687
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,019
because it was too big too scraggly too

688
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,720
long you know if anything they're

689
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:24,298
growing up here especially all the pot

690
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,900
that came from the the

691
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:29,879
60s and the 70s or the 60s when the

692
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,460
draft Dodgers were coming and then the

693
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,440
70s when their kids were getting you

694
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,019
know old enough or or something that

695
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,519
they were growing bad strains and I just

696
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:42,298
saw

697
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:45,058
one yeah so it's called Elmwood and it's

698
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:47,819
supposed to be this ancient genetic that

699
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:51,359
is supposed to be fire for outdoor

700
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,278
around here so I get a lot of

701
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,298
um

702
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:56,819
uh seeds

703
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:59,278
do you know any more history on Elmwood

704
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,980
or is that just basically no all I know

705
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:05,099
is I wanted the seed forever because I

706
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,980
heard of it yeah all I knew was like

707
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:11,939
when you get to Northern

708
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,319
London North London Lucan Exeter you

709
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,320
know a little bit further north maybe

710
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,720
not as far as

711
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,700
um not as far as own sound but maybe

712
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,579
kind of in that direction south of

713
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,380
Collingwood oh and South this was the

714
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,199
plant that everybody grew because it was

715
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:31,440
massive

716
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:34,558
uh was it the the the best don't know

717
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,538
but you know we would have people that

718
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,579
grew like this this strain is called

719
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:40,558
berry berry actually you know what this

720
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:42,599
is berry berry it's a uh and it was my

721
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,119
first centerfold in High Times oh what

722
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,398
what's in it it was just a [ __ ] seed

723
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,538
that a guy came in and says this is the

724
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:50,579
[ __ ] bomb

725
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:53,480
wow all right let's let's try it out we

726
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:56,038
grew it out it was had to be like an F1

727
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,079
uh because it was all over the place but

728
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:59,940
it would [ __ ] turn into something

729
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,398
like this I was just like

730
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,380
this is [ __ ] awesome and uh they

731
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,778
didn't have a [ __ ] name for it they

732
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,640
was like us taste smells like it might

733
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:10,759
be a blueberry salad I'm not calling it

734
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,278
blueberry yeah

735
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:18,658
all right it gets the uh gets the idea

736
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:21,298
you know what happens oh good

737
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:23,220
like I was curious when did you first

738
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:25,200
start uh or when did you first make

739
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,899
contact with high times and start

740
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,259
working with High Times uh

741
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:33,298
Kyle found me

742
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:36,960
um

743
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:38,339
Cushman yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right I

744
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,380
like to put that out I actually sent him

745
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:42,418
an email because he's out in [ __ ] the

746
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,820
oakster damn [ __ ]

747
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,940
spreading the uh

748
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,720
the what is he call it now the plant

749
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,778
Chiropractics or something like that

750
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,480
it's super cropping right yeah and it's

751
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:57,599
an article that's was the first article

752
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,720
and it was like a Grower's interview or

753
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:03,418
whatever on me yeah and

754
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,839
I didn't make it up I was shown by some

755
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:08,520
growers in uh in this area and I made

756
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:11,339
sure it was in the article saying you

757
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,500
know it's [ __ ] phenomenal technique

758
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:15,538
for people that are growing indoors that

759
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,298
want to grow certain trains certain ways

760
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:20,460
sure and don't want to have [ __ ] 50

761
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:23,220
plants you can have

762
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,340
two plants three plants and still get

763
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,778
two pounds yeah you know not it's gonna

764
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:29,759
take a little bit longer but you know

765
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:30,720
certain strains obviously work better

766
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,519
for it

767
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,819
but it's manipulating and training

768
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:38,158
plants uh to grow in a in a certain way

769
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:41,099
and um

770
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,200
and so when Kyle came through

771
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,898
so short long so short the other thing

772
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,179
with him teaching this is like how did

773
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:49,558
you learn this like I want I want I

774
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,960
don't want him to acknowledge me but I

775
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:55,619
want him to acknowledge the lineage of

776
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,179
the history yeah of this technique sure

777
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:59,178
because people deserve

778
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,819
yeah yeah right especially because I

779
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,319
don't talk to either of them anymore and

780
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:09,298
the one guy's the biggest dick in this

781
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,178
[ __ ] town when it comes to anything

782
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:15,839
in general but he showed me this

783
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,640
technique that [ __ ] got me recognized

784
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,678
that's what they flew me to high to uh

785
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,360
the Cannabis Cup to talk about it was

786
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,519
supposed to talk about Canadian

787
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,859
cultivation techniques and it was super

788
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,139
crappy yeah and then they did the same

789
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:29,939
thing with Soma five years later or

790
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,720
something but so anyways

791
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,840
um Kyle was living in Detroit

792
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,259
at the time and

793
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,278
um he was coming from maybe Toronto or

794
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:45,720
something

795
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,038
and I he must have heard about uh either

796
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,140
the seeds

797
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,179
or me or

798
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,759
um something can you hear that beeping

799
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,399
curiosity yes what is it like diabetic

800
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,359
thing I don't know oh it's okay and

801
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,778
um

802
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,240
and uh he just popped in the shop one

803
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:06,419
day at Organics and struck up the

804
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,019
conversation and we hit it off and then

805
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,919
um

806
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:12,418
he would come back and I would uh him

um and now I had a uh a run-in

872
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:54,719
with the Windsor border coming back from

873
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:59,160
a photo shoot

874
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:01,459
uh four High Times where I met with Kyle

875
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:05,279
um and the gangsters

876
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:08,338
and oh God another photographer [ __ ]

877
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,119
most I think the most famous uh

878
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:13,799
photographer back in the 90s to early

879
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,858
2000s

880
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,500
God damn it he was there dude he was

881
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:21,299
shooting also but anyways I was meeting

882
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,980
with Kyle so I brought

883
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,200
all my photos it was right after I got

884
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,800
back from Switzerland so I had all my

885
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:31,139
Swiss photos I had my Amsterdam photos

886
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,680
um and I got

887
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:36,838
I got this in the early 2000s then

888
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:38,879
because you said yes because I was in

889
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:42,119
Switzerland in 2000

890
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,380
so Switzerland didn't really get going I

891
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,180
don't think I was at the cup and I think

892
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,338
I did the cup in

893
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:49,980
no I did the cup

894
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:53,519
quit smoking pot two every two thousand

895
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,800
we've been two thousand and um

896
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,940
so when I that's what I was meeting I

897
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,180
would imagine that's what I was meeting

898
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,880
Kyle for because I brought all my photos

899
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:05,098
uh which always meant pictures which I

900
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,380
just basically use as proofs and then

901
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:11,820
slides because that's what the magazine

902
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:14,820
wanted and then video because I wanted

903
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,940
to uh document

904
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,980
the shoots yeah so when they pulled me

905
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,380
and I was driving my girlfriend at the

906
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,480
time had a

907
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,740
1969 Volkswagen bus

908
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,420
and I had

909
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:32,279
crazy dreads that were probably just

910
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,920
about my shoulder length but they were

911
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,480
still just finishing developing so they

912
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,000
were all over the [ __ ] place I was

913
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,039
like you know what I'm not Crossing with

914
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,599
anything definitely would never cross

915
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,139
with any [ __ ] pot or anything like

916
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,900
that and um got pulled over

917
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:51,118
and they said you know we were searching

918
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,400
the vehicle sure I guess I got a pot

919
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,838
leaf on my [ __ ] shirt and they said

920
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,579

921
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:58,500

[ __ ] uh paraphernalia shop

925
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:09,300
and I can't make it any easier than that

926
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:12,719
like no I'm dumb not stupid nothing yeah

927
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,920
illegal kind of thing and uh they said

928
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:15,659
okay well we're gonna search through the

929
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,440
vehicle and make you stand out stand in

930
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:19,019
front

931
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,539
and I watched the guy go around to the

932
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:23,699
back and he's a younger custom agent and

933
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:26,279
he holds up the first slide and you just

934
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:27,899
see his eyes go [ __ ] this big oh I

935
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,960
bet he thought he found the motherload

936
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,519
yeah I was like ah [ __ ] so I walk around

937
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,539
and I approach him and said Hey listen

00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,239
you know

939
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:38,880
not sure how the law is here I kind of

940
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,519
have an idea that you're allowed to look

941
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,858
through anything but there's people's

942
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,559
likeness in these photos that I do not

943
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:49,319
have model releases for so legally I

944
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,759
can't show them to anybody right and he

945
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,980
explained yes you're right you have

946
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,660
absolutely no [ __ ] rights here uh

947
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,838
we're allowed to look at every [ __ ]

948
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:59,039
photo every negative for pornographic

949
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,900
material

950
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,820
and he's like do you have any

951
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,619
pornographic material it's like [ __ ] no

952
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,838

954
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:11,699

955
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,799
titties yeah maybe models that are

956
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:16,399
holding cannabis and stuff like that but

957
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,720
nothing pornographic and he's like okay

958
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,200
I had

959
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:26,338
[ __ ] not hundreds but thousands if not

960
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,659
maybe ten thousand photos negatives in

961
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:30,179
that van

962
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:32,338
because I brought everything yeah

963
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:35,338
because that was a money cow for me for

964
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:37,078
High Times they loved it they and I

965
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:38,759
didn't get paid for all the pictures a

966
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:41,460
lot of it came into the grow America

967
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,099
because Kyle needed photos to put into

968
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,079
grow America and I say okay I'm gonna

969
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,059
donate this many but you're paying me

970
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,280
for this many right like if I got a

971
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:54,299
centerfold I got 600 bucks if they got a

972
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,400
full page I got 300 bucks [ __ ] so it uh

973
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:00,420
it made sense for me to do this so

974
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,338
anyways maybe that's you know he opened

975
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,920
up another box and literally thousands

976
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:06,059
of photos and he's looking at him and

977
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,320
it's like pot and I was like oh you want

978
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:09,539
to see some really nice ones I start

979
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,880
pulling out pictures from from uh

980
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:15,000
Switzerland which is Fields yeah yeah

981
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:18,180

00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,559
from the states kind kind of thing and

989
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,539

992
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,440
why do you have all this and luckily at

993
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:42,239
the same weekend they were having the

994
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,940
one of their uh

995
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,799
big Rave convention party kind of thing

996
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,599
I forget what they called it they had a

997
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,820
specific name and I was like oh I was

998
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:55,019
coming back from there and we set up a

999
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:57,780
booth to show people to use cannabis

1000
00:40:55,019 --> 00:41:01,800
because you don't have to have it tested

1001
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:03,900
for [ __ ] you know bad drugs right and

1002
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,180
they had them at these at these concerts

1003
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,680
or at these parties where if you got a

1004
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:09,000
pill they would go and they'd scratch

1005
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,598
off a little bit of it and they would

1006
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,280
test it and say yeah it is MDMA or it's

1007
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,039
you know some it's some speed or

1008
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,800
whatever they would be able to tell you

1009
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,119
um maybe not what's exactly in it but

1010
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,339
they could more or less tell you what's

1011
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,039
not in it right so I just made up that

1012
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:28,739
[ __ ] literally on the whim that I

1013
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:30,300
was coming from that and I had all the

1014
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:33,059
pictures that's just put out on display

1015
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,579
to show the show kids not the you know

1016
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,838
smoke pot don't [ __ ] do drugs don't

1017
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,599
do hard drugs

1018
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:41,159
they bought it they liked it I [ __ ]

1019
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,420
gave him one of my [ __ ] credit cards

1020
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:49,078
said Hey listen I offer uh 25 off any

1025
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,380
was one of the Techno festivals in

1026
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,379
Detroit yeah yeah and it was they were

1027
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,059
big back then

1028
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,559
I mean I wasn't trying to interrupt or

1029
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:06,119
anything like that but one of the one of

1030
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,338
the ways that we used to regularly go

1031
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,140
into into Canada

1032
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:12,480
um that um

1033
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:13,920
was we used to go like in especially in

1034
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,599
the Detroit scene with Windsor being

1035
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,358
right there there was parties that were

1036
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,160
thrown in Canada yeah right and there

1037
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:22,139
was a lot of border crossings well they

1038
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,358
learned like what hippies and ravers

1039
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:26,759
looked like and they didn't like them so

1040
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:30,000
we used to drive across the border there

1041
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,920
wearing like Dockers and polo shirts and

1042
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,960
all normal and all of our like real

1043
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,820
clothes were like stuffed in the trunk

1044
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,260
yeah of what we normally looked like

1045
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,420
because we were trying to go back and

1046
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,720
forth and look like the biggest nerds

1047
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:45,180
ever yeah right because if you you know

1048
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,980
if you looked a certain way you're gonna

1049
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:48,719
get you're gonna get checked out on a

1050
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,300
certain level and I just didn't have

1051
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,059
that option I had [ __ ] dreads and you

1052
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,339
know like I I did the opposite I was

1053
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,980
just like I'm driving a Volkswagen bus

1054
00:42:56,338 --> 00:43:01,619
okay I got a pot leaf on my shirt and I

1055
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,420
got [ __ ] dreads now I'm born in New

1056
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,858
York

1057
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,358
and I live in Canada so I have a

1058
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:09,358
passport for both

1059
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:11,279
they can't deny me wherever I go if I'm

1060
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:13,318
going to the states no matter what I

1061
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,880
look like they can't deny me because I'm

1062
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:16,920
only using my Canadian my U.S passport

1063
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,720
I'm gonna come back to Canada I'm not

1064
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,180
telling them that I have a passport for

1065
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,159
the states or vice versa I show them the

1066
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:24,960
[ __ ] Canadian passport right right

1067
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,578
can't deny me I know I look like

1068
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,280
somebody that you don't want to let in

1069
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,200
your country but I'm a citizen [ __ ] off

1070
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,000
you don't have a choice so it makes a

1071
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,618
big difference yeah I like that how do

1072
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,639
you know you're in the States now

1073
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:42,480
yeah okay all right I mean I uh you know

1074
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:44,039
it um you know I have uh I I have I have

1075
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,440
an uncle that does the same thing he has

1076
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,380
Brazilians citizenship because and he's

1077
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,880
he's American as well and so he uh he

1078
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,039
when he goes into Brazil he uses the

1079
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,300
Brazilian and he comes back into the U.S

1080
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,239
he uses America so it looks like he

1081
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:59,640
never goes anywhere but he's yeah

1082
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:01,919
constantly you know and he just uses you

1083
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,900
know and so but yeah I just I just

1084
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,240
remember especially in the Windsor area

1085
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,000
because Detroit was right there

1086
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,279
um as as the years in the 90s went on

1087
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,199
they definitely started

1088
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,540
um you know I don't know if you want to

1089
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,399
like what what you know profiling if you

1090
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:19,800
will oh you know he had an image of like

1091
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,139
what hippies looked like or what herbs

1092
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,180
Smugglers look like or what ravers

1093
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:26,039
looked like or you know what each one of

1094
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:28,379
these groups was likely to have on them

1095
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:31,259
or whatever you know so well I always I

1096
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:35,240
always tell people that you know I I

1097
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,240
kind of followed a certain

1098
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:41,338
mathematical equation for lack of better

1099
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,740
terms right the police know that what to

1100
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:46,559
look for right if

1101
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:52,318
um if you're in this industry

1102
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:55,099
so there's going to be uh 90 of our

1103
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,099
community

1104
00:44:55,739 --> 00:45:01,979
is susceptible to getting busted because

1105
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,380
of the way they look the way they smell

1106
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,780
the way they walk or talk right sure

1107
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,780
it's five percent on either side the

1108
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,720
five percent of the people in this in

1109
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,060
the movement or industry that never

1110
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,858
leave their house they don't go to the

1111
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:18,900
grow shop themselves they send somebody

1112
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:21,539
to send somebody to go buy the

1113
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,519
fertilizer go buy their seeds go buy

1114
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:26,940
what they want and then that person

1115
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:29,099
whoever purchases has no idea what who

1116
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,260
the person is that place the order kind

1117
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:33,300
of thing that person is never going to

1118
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,700
get busted they I mean it's going to be

1119
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,260
very unlikely that they get busted and

1120
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,118
then the other five percent is where I

1121
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,220
fall in I stand on the street corner

1122
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,338
with a [ __ ] six foot pot leaf with my

1123
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:46,919
dreads out in my Volkswagen going I'm a

1124
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:49,739
[ __ ] pot guy like they don't want

1125
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,440
that they they know who I am they know

1126
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,459
what I'm doing

1127
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,619
there's ninety percent of the other

1128
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,940
people are out there are susceptible to

1129
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,039
fill their quota

1130
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,059
why the [ __ ] do we want to drag in the

1131
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,460
dreadlock who's going to have the

1132
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:04,440
newspapers there so they're like we'll

1133
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,858
leave him alone so I'm in that five

1134
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,720
percent on the opposite side because I

1135
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:11,578
literally had a six foot pot leaf in my

1136
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:14,159
front window I literally did have pot

1137
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:16,019
plants growing in my front window and

1138
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,699
for a certain time my whole front window

1139
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:20,460

1163
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:17,219

okay um never got to meet him they were

1167
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:28,079
different direct I was actually I'd have

1168
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:30,000
worn out for my arrest in Connecticut so

1169
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,619
I wasn't going to go to Connecticut yeah

1170
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,300
no reason to be hanging out in

1171
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,519
Connecticut yeah there's no reason to do

1172
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,680
a [ __ ] Connecticut

1173
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:40,739
fine it was a speeding ticket so yeah it

1174
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,659
was 145 mile per hour speeding ticket so

1175
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:44,818
I never I never went back and I was like

1176
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,920
you know whatever but no reason told me

1177
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:50,279
about it and it seemed like a great

1178
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,720
strain now I had strawberry Diesel and I

1179
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,940
was like what what strawberry are they

1180
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,739
using kind of thing like you know is is

1181
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,440
did you give them my strawberry by

1182
00:47:55,739 --> 00:48:01,858
chance like you know what what you know

1183
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,420
and I never really got down that uh I

1184
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:06,239
never went down that rabbit hole to

1185
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,338
figure out what it was but from what I

1186
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:11,759
understand from what Kyle told me he's

1187
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:14,759
just like they hit the money shot with a

1188
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,760
[ __ ] uh with a plant that produced

1189
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,400
this [ __ ] fire pot it was [ __ ]

1190
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,900
phenomenal and um

1191
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,358
and

1192
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,559
[ __ ] do you know what was in the

1193
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:26,880
strawberry diesel you were running at

1194
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:30,299
the time

1195
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,400
no no no just because it was that was it

1196
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,200
was brought to me as yeah because the

1197
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,240
the cough itself did start in

1198
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,039
Connecticut and I got introduced to it

1199
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,659
it made its way out to Colorado through

1200
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:42,599
people who went from Connecticut to

1201
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:44,759
Colorado yeah um Kyle has always been a

1202
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,640
little bit [ __ ] uh you know he dances

1203
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,839
around origin stories because it's like

1204
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,460
one of the things that because you

1205
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:53,279
worked for High Times he got pretty well

1206
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,139
known for you know yeah and so as he's

1207
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,599
tried to become like a can of celebrity

1208
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:59,358
some of the origin stories of the things

1209
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,119
that he's known for he's gotten pretty

1210
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:05,699
uh you know pretty vague well I mean

1211
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,980
because the [ __ ] douchebag he sold

1212
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:10,139
the cough to [ __ ] Hank

1213
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:13,079
right that's why he's the Strawberry

1214
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:15,358
Cough seed was produced yeah is because

1215
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:17,460
[ __ ] and I don't know if the

1216
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,500
Connecticut boys got even a piece of it

1217
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,260

1218
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,920
um because and like when when Kyle and I

1219

00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,219
and so red had to go up make a side deal

1301
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:43,799
like okay we're going to give you a

1302
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:46,019
percentage but the [ __ ] douchebag he

1303
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:49,140
wrote down fast fatty

1304
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:51,539
I brought fast spear those guys hated

1305
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:53,460
fast beer [ __ ] didn't want anything

1306
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:56,159
to do they were all Ortega they were all

1307
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,780
big [ __ ] uh Indica freaks yeah yeah

1308
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,719
because they didn't [ __ ] work in the

1309
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,940
field you know red did a little bit but

1310
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,098
I was there for [ __ ] months you know

1311
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,079
Papa Bear came out there sat in the

1312
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:09,660
[ __ ] hammock smoke joints and [ __ ]

1313
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:12,720
with you know waited and thought he was

1314
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:17,879
the [ __ ] the king we uh We've read

1315
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:20,939
sweet tooth yes um strawberry blonde

1316
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,220
um the Louie

1317
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:26,240
I figured also we just basically we had

1318
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:26,239
a uh we had

1319
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
30 maybe 600 watts in a room

1320
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,099
mainly we were just doing cuttings

1321
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,099
because the company is called Mr hemp

1322
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:39,780
that Steve was working with and it was

1323
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:43,318
just it was right after they got busted

1324
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:46,319
for the selling pot to a minor but we

1325
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:51,058
still had the uh we sailed the facility

1326
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:54,300
in lagano and um we ended up uh just

1327
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:56,760
taking a mail and smacking it against

1328
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,900
the fan in the corner yeah it pollinated

1329
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,780
the whole like he couldn't barely see

1330
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:04,019
through the [ __ ] room and um so some

1331
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:07,019
of my seeds here someplace called the

1332
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:08,400
blonde bastard and the blonde bastard

1333
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:12,900
was uh

1334
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,220
was a strawberry blonde crossed

1335
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,160
um

1336
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:19,980
and they didn't want to do anything with

1337
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:21,598
it so I ended up uh keeping it

1338
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,940
let's see what was the uh strawberry

1339
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,980
blonde do you remember what was in there

1340
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,139
see this is

1341
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:33,240
what I remember

1342
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:36,299
with Steve is he he had a whole bunch of

1343
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:40,019
strains that were were good and I like

1344
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:42,780
um this here is uh uh big funk

1345
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:45,179
wait which was one of his trains and

1346
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:48,000
then uh the strawberry uh sorry the

1347
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:50,578
Sweet Tooth number four gotcha

1348
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,838
I'm pretty sure and again Steve would be

1349
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:54,119
better

1350
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:56,838
to understand it and I think part of

1351
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,838
this is

1352
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:04,019
um correct and part of it might be

1353
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:06,358
just my interpretation of it but I

1354
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:09,000
believe that he had a bunch of strains

1355
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:12,000
that were

1356
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,980
uh or he had he had one strain or he had

1357
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,380
a few strains that he thought were

1358
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:19,858
[ __ ] great okay and he found that

1359
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:22,858
[ __ ] resinous blueberry male he

1360
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:25,199
crossed everything with it now

1361
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:28,679
it was my understanding is when he got

1362
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:31,799
the um the the sweet pink grapefruit

1363
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:36,239
cutting yeah in California two cuttings

1364
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:37,740
came up to Vancouver Vic who I'm pretty

1365
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:39,779
sure that's the guy's name not sure what

1366
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:41,699
he was it didn't get the best reputation

1367
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:46,500
with the boys yeah

1368
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:49,019
um one cut and Steve got one cut are you

1369
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:51,000
talking about Vic High yes yeah okay

1370
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,759
yeah so but I don't know who he is like

1371
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,659
yeah he's no longer with us okay well

1372
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,819
you're good really clear yeah right but

1373
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:00,838
uh I have a feeling

1374
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:04,019
um

1375
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:07,400
Steve took that blueberry mail and the

1376
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:09,059
sweet and the the sweet pink grapefruit

1377
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,619
and

1378
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:12,599
crossed him

1379
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:14,640
and then grew out a bunch of this

1380
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:18,059
different seeds and

1381
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:21,299
one became Sweet Tooth one became big

1382
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:22,740
big treat one became you know this one's

1383
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:27,059
called Big Funk but that's not his

1384
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:28,139
Original Seed big treat was one of them

1385
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:31,680
um

1386
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:33,420
uh something bud I'm I know I haven't

1387
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,098
seen someplace I just don't know where

1388
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,180
the [ __ ] they are

1389
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:39,240
um

1390
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:41,279
but uh I have a feeling that Steve ended

1391
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:42,838
up with

1392
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,660
um

1393
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:48,420
a bunch of different phenos of that

1394
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:51,000
those two strains and that's what he

1395
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,400
started building his catalog off of yeah

1396
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,239
and then you know the Sweet Tooth which

1397
00:56:53,400 --> 00:57:01,139
was one of his more favorite I know he

1398
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:04,199
wanted to back cross it

1399
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:07,199
um maybe to that same blueberry

1400
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:09,019
or to the grapefruit and that kind of

1401
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:12,239
took different lines

1402
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:13,980
and stuff like that yeah so he had the

1403
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:16,558
uh he had two different shishka berries

1404
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,260
yeah the red line

1405
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:22,140
um

1406
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:24,059
the yellow yeah and uh you know so I

1407
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:26,338
don't know

1408
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:28,319
you know did that come from a dip

1409
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:31,019
because that you know he was pretty

1410
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:34,619
famous for growing these big huge long

1411
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:36,838
[ __ ] Spears yeah right there's a

1412
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:39,420
picture of his wife holding him and

1413
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:42,058
they're like [ __ ] three feet long of

1414
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:46,500
just straight colas kind of yeah you

1415
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:48,180
know and um I think you know so I have a

1416
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,579
feeling that maybe

1417
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:53,578
the um

1418
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:55,559
the seeds were all from

1419
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:57,839
the same

1420
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:01,980
uh same crosses but just different

1421
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:03,539
phenotypes yeah that he

1422
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:07,318
started

1423
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:09,239
creating new lines and uh I think the

1424
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:12,119
sweet tooth and the shishka berry were

1425
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:12,959
the ones that really stood out

1426
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:15,960
um

1427
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,220
the strawberry blonde the big tree the

1428
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,380
plum bud

1429
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:21,779
Plum Bud that I just saw that it was uh

1430
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,300
yeah that was uh and I know I have that

1431
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:26,099
too okay I'm sure I have all these

1432
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,140
[ __ ] seeds someplace man I'm blind as

1433
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:30,059
[ __ ] though Plum I see Plum crossed a

1434
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:31,920
mighty might that was West Coast Seeds

1435
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:34,019
but yeah there's the plum bud

1436
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,700
it described it a little bit saying that

1437
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:37,318
it smelled very fruity but it didn't go

1438
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:39,838
into detail

1439
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:41,639
no what the hell is this Gabriella

1440
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:43,078
Island I got yeah

1441
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:44,460
I wouldn't be able to see that

1442
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:46,380
collection I bet you have some cool

1443
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,000
stuff in there that I have no idea like

1444
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,400
it because I I keep track of everything

1445
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,219
but I just write it down and not think

1446
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,019
about it anymore

1447
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:57,058
you know like this pungent skunk from

1448
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:59,099
Legends right like

1449
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,140
what is that I don't even [ __ ] we

1450
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:03,900
even sold that strain right you didn't

1451
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:06,539
no no and it was just one of the

1452
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,519
genetics that you know we grew out that

1453
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:10,739
we liked

1454
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:12,480
um this is from Khmer

1455
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:14,779
what the hell is this [ __ ] stream

1456
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,000
calz calzar

1457
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:20,460
colors are so that's a C4 it's like a

1458
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,199
Cali or calories I like the C4 it didn't

1459
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,599
produce worth of [ __ ] but it [ __ ] was a

1460
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:26,279
good train so like Calio shiske Berry or

1461
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:29,760

anything to do with the [ __ ] uh

1501

um fast fear yeah right I was all fast

1503
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:18,599

1504
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:21,240
day working I couldn't smoke Ortega I

1505

[ __ ] it would puddle me yeah well I

1506
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:26,338
would uh I was all about the [ __ ]

1507
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:29,159
night queen and the fast beer and now

1508
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:32,779
these strains are all strains from uh

1509
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:36,058
Neville yeah these three seeds came from

1510
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:37,440
uh little Eddie douchebag sorry I don't

1511
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,640
like a lot of people which one Eddie

1512
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,119
Eddie which one

1513
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:45,900
my Dutchman no oh oh oh nobody likes him

1514
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:48,119
yeah but um so the deal was he was hired

1515
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:52,139
by Mr hemp at the same time that Steve

1516
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:54,780
was and he brought all these seeds that

1517
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:57,358
Neville owed him the story was Neville

1518
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:00,839
old him owed him a bunch of money

1519
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:01,798
and instead of paying him he found a

1520
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:04,980
[ __ ]

1521
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:08,298
box of seeds in the back of a freezer

1522
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:12,420
when he had to jump ship

1523
01:02:08,298 --> 01:02:14,219
and gave him to Ed as payment partial

1524
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,139
payment whatever so those seeds ended up

1525
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:18,239
in Switzerland they ended up in the

1526
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:20,338
field and we had that's where the

1527
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,979
Neville that's where the uh the night

1528
01:02:20,338 --> 01:02:25,259
Queen the fast fatty fast beer or take

1529
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,880
Devil's Haze probably goes from there I

1530
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:30,000
don't think I don't think we had

1531
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,099
Neville's Hayes in our field we had

1532
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,780
strains I never heard of right these are

1533
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:36,119
all strains no one's ever heard of

1534
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:40,079
gotcha because they were they were out

1535
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:43,680
of the freezer they were a box that

1536
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:46,559
Neville sold to somebody I meant to talk

1537
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:49,460
to Neville about this before he passed

1538
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,140
that and it was like

1539
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:54,298
five years ago six years ago I had

1540
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:56,960
another a new contact

1541
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:59,519
UM through the Mr hemp seed thing

1542
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,740
and uh I never got a chance to talk to

1543
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,780
him about it what do you want to ask him

1544
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:06,719
uh it was more about the history of this

1545
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,880
box of seats okay and what year was a

1546
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,739
box of seeds that's why I'm not sure but

1547
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,780
I could tell you that they were still

1548
01:03:10,739 --> 01:03:14,098
viable in

1549
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,079
in

1550
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:20,519
um

1551
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:22,740
2000 yeah 99 probably uh the story was

1552
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:25,500
that

1553
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:27,659
um somebody ordered these seeds

1554
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,579
never picked them up

1555
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:32,940
so they got forgotten about in the back

1556
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:35,519
of the freezer when

1557
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,338
when time came for him to thaw out the

1558
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,139
freezer for whatever reason he passed

1559
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:41,818
them on to Ed

1560
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:43,739
for again what I was told for an

1561
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:48,420
outstanding debt

1562
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:51,000
and uh Ed broaden Switzerland and Steve

1563
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,338
plant him and Steve planted them and

1564
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,699
then Ed had a falling out with Peter

1565
01:03:53,338 --> 01:03:59,818
with Miss with with Mr hemp and he was

1566
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:01,919
gone and I was brought in to replace him

1567
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:03,739
and I they actually even gave me his

1568
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,180
phone I still had his phone

1569
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:07,259
when I got there which I think is one of

1570
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,759
the reasons why because it was still in

1571
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,500
his name and I was calling Canada and

1572
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,760
all over the [ __ ] I was sitting in a

1573
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,039
field in the middle of the South yeah

1574
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,540
why not I was like [ __ ] it like I don't

1575
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:18,539
particularly care for the guy anyways

1576
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:21,539
yeah and um so that's why that's what I

1577
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:24,239
heard did you uh did you have any old

1578
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:26,639

early days of Scentsy yeah

1581
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,680

the okay so back back then

1609
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:36,540
um

1610
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:38,759
when it wasn't the Scentsy Bank it was

1611
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:40,558
just the seed bank yeah yeah right so

1612
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,480
that was before Neville sold this stuff

1613
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,519
to Scentsy it was just yeah yeah so it

1614
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,519
would have been Neville now I thought it

1615
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:50,460
was a partnership between Neville

1616
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,019
and Ben that was uh that was adversy

1617
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:54,119
Bank

1618
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:55,440
I thought that was that's what brought

1619
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:57,780
the end of the seed bank I thought it

1620
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,599
was that when Scentsy seed started

1621
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:03,240
I don't what was it the bus that that uh

1622
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:05,640
made Neville sell to us to drunkers I

1623
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:07,318
don't know I don't know I just know that

1624
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:09,838
basically

1625
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:13,558
the story almost basically the story was

1626
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:15,599
told that Neville was the breeder for

1627
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:18,780
Santi seed bank he did breed for them

1628
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:21,359
for a little bit so but you know it was

1629
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:25,559
all of his genetics yes that he was

1630
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:27,259
breeding yeah so when when the first

1631
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:30,298
um

1632
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:32,520
catalogs were coming out of the sentency

1633
01:06:30,298 --> 01:06:34,500
bank you had early Pearl you had silver

1634
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:36,960
Pearl in them

1635
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:40,139
we loved it because again we were

1636
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,099
dealing with genetics that were

1637
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:43,318
um

1638
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:45,298
from Neville like these were these were

1639
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:47,219
the original [ __ ] strains like I mean

1640
01:06:45,298 --> 01:06:51,119
other than like the skunk and the

1641

1655
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:27,659

it's going to be [ __ ] you [ __ ]

1683
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,900
because Steve

1684
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:36,000
is a big guy yeah I've never seen him

1685
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:37,979
fight but I wouldn't want to see him

1686
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,819
fight because he would fight in a

1687
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:43,678
[ __ ] heartbeat yeah and um you know

1688
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:45,000
so

1689
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,980
um

1690
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,920
but yeah fighting fighting the mob is

1691
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:51,000
not like no it's just taking it he was

1692
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,679
going to go in there and literally Fire

1693
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,939
Bomb the [ __ ] place like he was like

1694
01:08:52,679 --> 01:09:00,060
[ __ ] [ __ ] Gary sucks [ __ ] right so so

1695
01:08:56,939 --> 01:09:01,439
anyways um so again this is again where

1696
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:04,020
you know

1697
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,479
we're we're like [ __ ] the elders uh

1698
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:09,060
sitting in the teepee trying to

1699
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:10,979
regurgitate stories and we kind of go by

1700
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:13,259
what we're what we hear and what we're

1701
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:17,059
told kind of thing some of us get to

1702
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:20,100
witness it firsthand some of us hear it

1703
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:22,440
regurgitated once or twice and we never

1704
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,838
know so that's why like with like I say

1705
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:27,059
with those seeds from you know the this

1706
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:28,738
fast spear this night Queen you know

1707
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:30,060
this fast fatty these and there's a

1708
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:34,619
whole bunch of other [ __ ] strains in

1709
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:37,259
there that you know I was I was told

1710
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:39,599
this story and it anybody that I reach

1711
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:41,880
out to and and hear pieces from they

1712
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,980
kind of connect a little bit they kind

1713
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,359
of sound similar so about them being

1714
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:47,399
seeds from Neville and stuff like that

1715
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,039
yeah it makes sense for the time most

1716
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:52,500
times it was based on his his one of the

1717
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:55,560
things that Neville mentions a bunch is

1718
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,880
that it seems like 90 of what he made he

1719
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,039
never released

1720
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,079
in the sense that he had strains that he

1721
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:02,939
liked that got put on the catalogs but

1722
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:05,399
he'd make hybrids of all kinds of things

1723
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:07,979
right and only a tiny percentage of

1724
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:09,420
those things ever got offered up an

1725
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:12,419
actual sale

1726
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:15,899
we wouldn't um

1727
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:18,480
we wouldn't uh breed I wouldn't breed

1728
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:19,859
anything without somebody else's

1729
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:24,178
permission

1730
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:27,238
unless it was a publicly you know

1731
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:30,658
um uh available anybody can buy seeds

1732
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:33,839
from like sexy you know I would breed

1733
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:35,639
and not think about now with Luke I

1734
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,560
wouldn't do that because because you

1735
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,800
know he's very particular well and he's

1736
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,719
he was small and same as uh

1737
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,000
um you know so the small one same as

1738
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:47,340
Soma yeah um

1739
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,100
I wouldn't uh I wouldn't read any of his

1740
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:52,800
stuff unless I would you know I kind of

1741
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:55,739
asked him kind of thing and even with

1742
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,239
this like with all my genetics my my uh

1743
01:10:55,738 --> 01:10:59,158
B-93

1744
01:10:57,238 --> 01:11:01,619
I don't want to I can't sell that strain

1745
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:03,179
like people I was offered a lot of money

1746
01:11:01,619 --> 01:11:06,179
for it I'm working on a deal right now

1747
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:08,760
to trade somebody for it but it's gonna

1748
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,679
be and it's just because I want uh Sam

1749
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,480
skunk

1750
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:15,000
um

1751
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:17,339
um I have an opportunity to get the one

1752
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,100
of the original skunk one Cuts back oh

1753
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,840
nice when we were and Sean you I think

1754
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:25,500
you in town with uh [ __ ] that

1755
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:28,199
epileptic [ __ ] kid yeah yeah which

1756
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:31,260
one tell you so this is just this kid

1757
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:33,960
that um Frills was yeah so he was

1758
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:36,060
brought to me by the TCC the Toronto

1759
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,079
Compassion Center uh said listen we have

1760
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,620
this kid

1761
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:42,119
uh he's uh he's a good grower

1762
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:43,559
um but he's mixed up with the wrong

1763
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:46,019
people we need to get him out of this

1764
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:48,120
town can you take them brought him and

1765
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:50,699
his mom and his sister to London set him

1766
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:52,140
up in an apartment set up a garden the

1767
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:53,399
whole bit turned out to be a great

1768
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,360
Gardener

1769
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:56,759
um

1770
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:59,219
but it went to his head and then of

1771
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:02,219
course yeah that that original story

1772
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:04,739
never finished I think he's still

1773
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:07,560
dwelling in that reality where

1774
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:10,259
he was always a go super big kind of guy

1775
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,360
and then getting in in business with

1776
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:14,880
really bad people and it would always go

1777
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:16,799
very very very bad out west like as soon

1778
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,319
as he left here because it happened over

1779
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,420
and over and over you know and like he

1780
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:23,759
would always be like like when when he

1781
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:25,199
would get [ __ ] destroyed she'd be

1782
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,060
like I'm never growing again I'm never

1783
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:29,519
growing again and then he's like buying

1784
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:33,000
or he's involved in these like giant

1785
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:36,960
farm chicken coops filled you know like

1786
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,340
it's you know when I when I met him we

1787
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,158
he was

1788
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,800
because of his and his mom I loved his

1789
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:47,339
mom and his sister

1790
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,500
um but they had no control so they would

1791
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:51,779
uh we would grow he would grow a bunch

1792
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,179
of pop for the center I would give them

1793
01:12:51,779 --> 01:12:56,399
a receipt and then I would give them a

1794
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:58,800
certain amount every week or every month

1795
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,719
because if I gave all the money to Tilly

1796
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:05,179
which I did in a few times he went out

1797
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,179
and literally bought 200 worth of candy

1798
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:09,540
he's like I was like where's the money

1799
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:12,179
you were supposed to pay your hydro bill

1800
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:14,340
oh [ __ ] man he's like he's literally had

1801
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:16,560
bags of [ __ ] candy and his mom you

1802
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,900
know well not just that but I remember

1803
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,120
the dude would be like stretches long

1804
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:23,219
stretches of time where all he would eat

1805
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:24,899
is like lobster dipped in butter or

1806
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:27,359
something like that you know like he was

1807
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:28,759
just that type of like it was always

1808
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,920
extreme

1809
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,360
bending like like uh crazy that was

1810
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,100
after me because I didn't allow that

1811
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:38,698
then he he started hanging out with uh

1812
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:42,600
eggboy yeah yeah right they got [ __ ]

1813
01:13:38,698 --> 01:13:45,359
busted in my truck yeah with 480 plants

1814
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,739
or something and I get sucked into it my

1815
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:48,599
dad got sucked into it because it was

1816
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:52,079
his truck you know and I was just like

1817
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:54,659
and then they drop off a vehicle because

1818
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,880
we switch vehicles turns out to be

1819
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:59,099
stolen right so I'm driving around in a

1820
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,800
stolen [ __ ] Jeep Cherokee oh that's

1821
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:03,179
uh that's a really [ __ ] douchebags

1822
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,699
but that's skunk one that's the whole

1823
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:08,460
reason of story he had

1824
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:11,359
we had him growing the black domino and

1825
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:14,520
the skunk one and this skunk one I had

1826
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:16,799
again it just landed in my lap through

1827
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,679
all these connections I would imagine it

1828
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:23,039
would have came from the early Scentsy

1829
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:26,158
days yeah but it was that [ __ ] real

1830
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:27,658
skunk and it was a fine Dutchman I think

1831
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:30,658
it was

1832
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:33,539
is his name Scott does that mean

1833
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:35,039
Dutchman's Eddie Eddie right yeah and it

1834
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:37,738
was a common name yeah so he was

1835
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:41,279
supposed to be one of the original skunk

1836
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:45,619
uh sellers of the scenes yeah yeah and

1837
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:49,559
so he had like some of the more pure uh

1838
01:14:45,619 --> 01:14:52,319

[ __ ] TV no you're good black actually

1851

black domino was out of anything that I

1852
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,460
personally popped from Amsterdam as far

1853
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:23,460
as seeds that were available to the

1854
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:26,158
public that was the nicest thing I I

1855
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:28,020
personally found do you remember the uh

1856
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:31,198
the description they were like it would

1857
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:33,659
leave a man feeling whipped and

1858
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:36,299
something like the description that the

1859
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:38,698
that the boys put in there uh yeah

1860
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,199
full-blooded Indica with large bracks

1861
01:15:38,698 --> 01:15:42,719
we'll soon have you on your knees and

1862
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:44,939
begging for more yes harsh overpowering

1863
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,800
lady simply gushes sticky resin to which

1864
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:49,139
most men seem to have a Fatal Attraction

1865
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,940
a word of warning this powerful compact

1866
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,440
Indica has had devastating effect on

1867
01:15:50,939 --> 01:15:54,960
many a man leaving them apparently

1868
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:57,178
beaten and whipped with a strange smile

1869
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,380
on their faces not so usually looks like

1870
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:01,199
this after he gets done with the

1871
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:03,359
conversations with me though yeah yeah I

1872
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:06,899
love that kind of stuff and uh me too

1873
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:10,019
when we uh when Ron was doing the uh

1874
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:12,539
Canadian cannabis cups here in town and

1875
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:16,199
we had the Red Devil I kind of stole

1876
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:19,079
that kind of Mantra from from that to

1877
01:16:16,198 --> 01:16:20,819
describe the Red Devil yes making up a

1878
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:22,679
bunch it was a [ __ ] fire strange it

1879
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:25,619
was great strain was a bunch of [ __ ]

1880
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:27,420
that I was saying but um I love that

1881
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:30,899
that's the first time I saw a red devil

1882
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:32,460
I believe it was Greenhouse that came

1883
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:34,439
out with that or at least they were the

1884
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:36,500
first people to sell public seeds of it

1885
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:41,819
yeah

1886
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:43,859
I ended up getting was from a alcoholic

1887
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:45,658
guy that was a good grower from around

1888
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:47,759
here

1889
01:16:45,658 --> 01:16:50,899
um

1890
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,900
but uh

1891
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:55,198
um what is this

1892
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:59,039
Red Devil yeah Greenhouse it's in your

1893

catalog and uh yeah Afghani Afghanistan

1894
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:04,260

1895
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:07,019
Shanti doesn't still we've I've never

1896
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:09,719
known it but like if if you know if he

1897
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:11,400
tries to sell a version of that based on

1898
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:12,899
you know because he sells devil but

1899
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:15,059
they've never explained what the [ __ ] it

1900
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:17,639
is right yeah I heard that too I heard

1901
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:20,340
about the devil but I don't know if it's

1902
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:22,980
uh and again right now was it cutting

1903
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:23,640
brought to me sure and

1904
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:25,919

1907
01:17:27,899 --> 01:17:33,420

1929
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:21,299
questions about him yeah I don't want to

1930
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:25,380
like literally I did a lot with the

1931
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:26,760
quebeci company that was his [ __ ] guy

1934
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:34,319

1935
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:36,300
and uh Willie would basically in his

1936
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:39,179
backyard along his fence line

1937
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:43,020
again this is what I was told he would

1938
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:45,000
grow a male and a female and then five

1939
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,860
feet ten feet apart another a different

1940
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,439
male and different female sounds about

1941
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:51,979
right yeah so if you were buying a seed

1942
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:55,079
and his seed was 30 bucks for yeah

1943
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:56,579
right yeah but he was saying oh this is

1944
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:57,840
Northern Lights oh this is this strain

1945
01:18:56,579 --> 01:19:00,119
this is this train it's like no it's not

1946
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,679
he has no [ __ ] clue it might have

1947
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:03,059
some of that in it be honest with the

1948
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,100
people you only charge you thirty

1949
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:07,020
dollars a [ __ ] 10 pack yeah you don't

1950
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:10,199
need to make [ __ ] up yeah you know

1951
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:11,760
[ __ ] tell people that this is what I

1952
01:19:10,198 --> 01:19:13,738
did this so I breed it I'm only charging

1953
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,840
30 bucks you know

1954
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:17,399
but I didn't I didn't like him I didn't

1955
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,800
think I thought he was kind of dishonest

1956
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:21,420
well yeah I mean if that's if that's how

1957
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,860
he was doing his [ __ ] it's obvious that

1958
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:25,619
like you know the cross-pollination is

1959
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:28,939
gonna occur you know

1960
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:28,939
um that's that's not cool

1961
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,158
so

1962
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,279
um what's up what are some of the

1963
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:36,719
posters behind you before I forget

1964
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:39,658
um

1965
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:42,899
oh this is a chemo I remember I've seen

1966
01:19:39,658 --> 01:19:43,979
before that the uh the one chemo and now

1967
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:46,019
I think

1968
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:48,658
it's the

1969
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:51,300
[ __ ] I don't even remember I know one of

1970
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:52,799
them went pink and I'm pretty sure it

1971
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:56,159
was the Ottawa

1972
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,199
cut that went pink could be the UBC one

1973
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,319
but basically the auto one one is

1974
01:19:58,198 --> 01:20:04,919
probably just a UBC

1975
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:06,479
uh that was poly this is a spice of life

1976
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,039
strain tube I don't know who the [ __ ]

1977
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:09,779
Eric is

1978
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:13,198
a hurricane

1979
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:16,259
um so this is uh so let me just let me

1980
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,939
get the C pack back in there

1981
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:19,199
uh and I don't mind sending a bunch of

1982
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:21,419
these seeds if you want to [ __ ] try

1983
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,158
like yeah me and a me and a good friend

1985
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:26,158
happily

1986
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:33,899
it's so [ __ ] cool UBC chemo all right

1987
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:36,238
chemo poster yeah it was a [ __ ]

1988
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:38,399
centerfold in iPhone

1989
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,779
I'm just gonna pick this up so this here

1990
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:42,658
is

1991
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:46,619
where's the camera there we go there we

1992
01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:49,379
go so this here is the berry berry oh

1993
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:52,319
nice uh so and it actually says it in

1994
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:54,420
the upper corner yeah yeah and then uh

1995
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:57,899
sorry I have to try to get the so this

1996
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:59,460
here is the chemo that it might be the

1997
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:02,099
Ottawa because it's pink pistol yeah I

1998
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:03,539
think I think it is and I can you know

1999
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,880
this is what I've been told but it's

2000
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:07,560
super nice because it's super pink yeah

2001
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,739
it's beautiful

2002
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,539
um I I have tons of [ __ ] photos of it

2003
01:21:10,738 --> 01:21:15,119
dude I see you know I told people for

2004
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:16,439
years like chemo sounded cool but like

2005
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:18,179
and everybody always said they liked it

2006
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:21,238
but the name always turned me off yeah

2007
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:24,239
well again the theory the the history

2008
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:27,718
was like the G13 yeah that it came out

2009
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:29,879
of California and it was used uh for

2010
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:33,119
medical patients that were going to

2011
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:35,840
chemo right and then uh maybe the cut

2012
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:38,039
came out a piece out of um California

2013
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:41,340
might have been called something else

2014
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:43,979
yeah got to UBC they were using it maybe

2015
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:46,500
for medical uh for chemo patients that's

2016
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:49,379
how it got its name but I was just told

2017
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:52,738
that uh yeah it got its name from uh

2018
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:54,359
could be used okay so this also this was

2019
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:57,299
another centerfold it's [ __ ] it's hard

2020
01:21:54,359 --> 01:22:00,599
to see because of the uh yeah what is

2021
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:02,219
this one that's also berry berry and um

2022
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,900
yeah so you can't really see it it may

2023
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:06,539
be better that way but

2024
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:09,420
um it was like it was a go-to strain for

2025
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:12,779
me for a long time yeah because it was

2026
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:14,779
just uh it was so

2027
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:14,779
um

2028
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:21,659
about this chat is because it we wildly

2029
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,819
bounce around there's like all kinds of

2030
01:22:21,658 --> 01:22:26,339
of things that I think of that I want to

2031
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:28,619
chat about and then by the time that I

2032
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:30,920
wanted to merged on to some different

2033
01:22:28,619 --> 01:22:33,599
year totally different people whatever

2034
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,119
it's amazing in that regard because

2035
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,579
we're covering so much ground but uh

2036
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:41,219
yeah yeah you said you're friends with

2037

2039
01:22:43,738 --> 01:22:47,939
fast spear that's in uh with his no

2040
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:49,799
shirt on this [ __ ] guy he showed up

2041
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:50,698
to the field I'll see if I can find a

2042
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,679
picture of this can you take a picture

2043

of that later and send it to me yeah

2044
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:56,940

2045
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,039
was this uh we I used to go to these

2046
01:22:56,939 --> 01:23:01,500
Harvest festivals in the early 2000s

2047
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:03,420
yeah and there was this guy Matt knows

2048
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,238
who he is there was this guy chip

2049
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:08,640
um that started Royal gold Matt and he

2050
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:11,099
had just been out to Switzerland I think

2051
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,600
it was an 01 maybe or something and so I

2052
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:15,120
remember the first time I saw pictures

2053
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,940
like you were mentioning of those fields

2054
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:20,519
and hectors and huge greenhouses and all

2055
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:21,899
that he came back with all these photos

2056
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,780
on his computer

2057
01:23:21,899 --> 01:23:26,460
of all these people in Switzerland that

2058
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:29,359
were just starting to blow it up and at

2059
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:31,800
the time it was the largest yeah

2060
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:33,960
they were doing it under aromathery so

2061
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,000
we had this is one of a this is a field

2062
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:41,340
here one of the fields with me let's see

2063
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,779
oh yeah Jesus yeah and uh it was for uh

2064
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,940
aromatherapy

2065
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:47,219
that's kind of a that's us harvesting

2066
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:49,079
some of them kind of I remember way back

2067
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:51,359
then when you were out there somebody

2068
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:53,640
showed me a picture because you weren't

2069
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:56,219
around and it was you sitting in an

2070
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:59,039
armchair oh and you had flower up to

2071
01:23:56,219 --> 01:24:00,779
your knees yeah all you've seen in the

2072
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,179
frame was like flour up to your knees

2073
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:04,859
yeah it was so funny and for the young

2074
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:07,020
people watching now that are like in

2075
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:09,079
their in their 20s looking at this and

2076
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:13,020
they're thinking yeah that's right there

2077
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:15,238
we did we had terracotta floors and we

2078
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,280
didn't have enough place to hang it so

2079
01:24:15,238 --> 01:24:20,158
if you the funniest thing is on the on

2080
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:21,139
the table there there's only uh two sets

2081
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:23,939
of scissors

2082
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:25,920
we didn't know it we we had to harvest

2083
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:28,139
all the tops so we went through the

2084
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,579
field harvested all the tops brought

2085
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:31,079
them back and we're like we can't even

2086
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:33,179
hang them there's not enough to say so

2087
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:34,859
we just laid them all terracotta and we

2088
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:37,859
just went in and rotated them every day

2089
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:39,658
and that's uh me sitting in the chair I

2090
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:41,219
can I mean for people like Matt was

2091
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:44,099
saying for people that are younger I

2092
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:46,500
think Switzerland for the most part was

2093
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:49,760
the first time that it was like us

2094
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:52,800
seeing like non-land race type pictures

2095
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,340
of you know people actually growing on

2096
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,860
that large of a scale yeah

2097
01:24:55,340 --> 01:25:01,260
it's so bad like people are used to

2098
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:02,639
seeing big CBD grows here is what I'm

2099
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,440
saying like people our age are used to

2100
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,600
seeing these massive hemp pros and stuff

2101
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:08,339
but people during that era you would

2102
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,440
never [ __ ] see this so it was really

2103
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:12,600
it was a really unique time it was a

2104
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:14,579
very special time and for that era like

2105
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,579
people in the U.S seeing stuff like this

2106
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:20,279
was mind-blowing at the time yeah see

2107
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:22,140
this year that's we had a company in

2108
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:23,759
town called novaks and you're supposed

2109
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:26,100
to take your bag into different parts of

2110
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:29,159
the world and uh enter it in a contest

2111
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:30,600
right yeah and I basically got the most

2112
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:34,559
votes but they can't they because it

2113
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,360
wasn't legal I got [ __ ] uh there was

2114
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,520
a do you know Felix

2115
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:42,119
um oh yeah

2116
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:46,520
yeah owl yeah yeah so uh this is his

2117
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:46,519
field in in Switzerland wow

2118
01:25:47,238 --> 01:25:54,779
he had such shooting plans but I mean

2119
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:57,359
yeah yeah his uh like his this is his

2120
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:58,738
his what his field looked like

2121
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:00,599
you know do you have any of his stuff

2122
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:02,638
saved

2123
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,739
don't think so he used to supply so

2124
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,940
impossible to get it's so impossible to

2125
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:07,559
get in the U.S because he just never

2126
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:10,559
shipped here so it was like and then

2127
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,560
yeah

2128
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:14,759
the uh oh so this is the Sweet Tooth

2129
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,639
Garden

2130
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:19,739
um oh very cool that's what we we

2131
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,940
um sorry for the [ __ ] no I've seen

2132
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:25,218
yeah I've seen that picture before I

2133
01:26:20,939 --> 01:26:25,219
think that's a great picture yeah and um

2134
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:34,579
I think that one is there's there's a

2135
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:40,939
few of the Switzerland that's activity

2136
01:26:34,579 --> 01:26:40,939
that's the skunk one on this side oh wow

2137
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,279
yeah so that's the story it's a dark

2138
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:49,079
picture yeah she has the black domino

2139
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:50,579
yeah yeah and yeah before you offload

2140
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:52,679
that let us know so we can make sure

2141
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:55,198
that thing stays alive forever oh no I

2142
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:57,779

2143
01:26:55,198 --> 01:27:00,599

2144
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:07,139

2145
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:08,820
the b-98 the Widow 95 and the um B93 I

2146
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:11,940
think would be nice because it was our

2147
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:14,759
Northern Lights so yeah so this was my

2148
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:16,500
version of Northern Lights And if you

2149
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,960
look at the size that's a four inch Cube

2150
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:20,819
oh wow yeah and they were just following

2151
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,119
each other like when you see the the

2152
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:27,000
sizes and nugs

2153
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:29,039
looking like it was like it was the best

2154
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,460
sea of green plant and it was and it was

2155
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:34,500
an l like was it a pure NL I don't know

2156
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,300
but it looks a lot like what I would

2157
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,520
picture the nl5 cut looking like yeah

2158
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:39,779
yeah exactly and I thought it was just

2159
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,520
you know

2160
01:27:39,779 --> 01:27:43,920
um it was yeah it was just a phenomenal

2161
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:47,699
cut kind of thing so there's another one

2162
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:50,520

2163
01:27:47,698 --> 01:27:53,219

2164
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:55,080
uh we would we had such this is in

2165
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:56,000
Switzerland too so we had such a [ __ ]

2166
01:27:55,079 --> 01:27:58,139
good time

2167
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,020
that's when everybody loved everybody

2168
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:02,760
yeah and uh when he when that guy first

2169
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:05,940
showed up the [ __ ] Switzerland

2170
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:08,880
[ __ ] guy sees the field he gets all

2171
01:28:05,939 --> 01:28:12,259
excited he goes home and he shaves from

2172
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:15,060
his like shoulder down to his wrist

2173
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:16,079
shaved his entire arms both sides I'm

2174
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,760
like what the [ __ ] are you doing he's

2175
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:21,738
like dude I'm running through the field

2176
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:25,199
with my arms out and I'm gonna make hash

2177
01:28:21,738 --> 01:28:28,979
if you wanted finger rub he made it like

2178
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:31,019
[ __ ] 10 feet 20 feet lost his breath

2179
01:28:28,979 --> 01:28:34,259
couldn't get a [ __ ] quarter of a

2180
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:36,000
[ __ ] gram off of them but his arms

2181
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:38,159
are shaved and he was done I was like

2182
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,560
you got to be fine like it was a good

2183
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:43,079
thought good effort he literally did

2184
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,760
shave his [ __ ] arms

2185
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:47,039
right I don't think he got a single

2186
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:49,139
[ __ ] gram of hash kind of thing so so

2187
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:51,179
we made it about two hours in right now

2188
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:54,179
there I know there's so much more we can

2189
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:56,340
cover oh yes um but we could do a part

2190
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:57,840
two yeah I was hoping actually that we

2191
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:00,119
could have you back and we could we

2192
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,719
could see if we could get kick back yeah

2193
01:29:00,119 --> 01:29:06,859
yeah or or maybe even Chris Clay also

2194
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:09,239
has an option because I know that

2195
01:29:06,859 --> 01:29:11,639
like I mentioned before there was about

2196
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:13,379
I don't even know how many questions or

2197
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:15,060
how many follow-ups I could think of

2198
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:17,219
while you were talking about stuff but

2199
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:19,440
then we just tangented it off onto

2200
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:21,000
something totally different which is

2201
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:23,839
amazing no you don't have to apologize I

2202
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,179
don't have ADHD too so it's okay

2203
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:29,520
if you read my book like I can

2204
01:29:27,179 --> 01:29:31,500
send you a copy if you need or I need a

2205
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,060
signed copy right very stream of

2206
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,698
Consciousness which I liked you know

2207
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:37,800
yeah it was my book is written that way

2208
01:29:35,698 --> 01:29:41,039
because I wrote it as if I'm having a

2209
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,360
conversation and I had to hire somebody

2210
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:46,319
to

2211
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:49,198
listen to me take notes and then try to

2212
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:51,299
put it in [ __ ] order that's the way I

2213
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,579
talk it's not in perfect order and I'm

2214
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:55,079
looking at it going because I smoked a

2215
01:29:53,579 --> 01:29:56,698
lot of pop back then I was like did that

2216
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:59,399
have and I remember it happening this

2217
01:29:56,698 --> 01:30:03,119
way and then another story that crosses

2218
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:04,920
with it doesn't line up perfectly [ __ ] I

2219
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:07,079
don't know but I did make a huge mistake

2220
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:08,760
in my book

2221
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:13,260
um and it wasn't my mistake it was a

2222
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:15,840
misprint where it says that I grew a

2223
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:19,079
Cannabis Cup winning strain which I did

2224
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:22,679
it was a fast beer it was my [ __ ] not

2225
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:25,439
my strain yeah but I grew it I'm I was

2226
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:27,420
the one that chose to enter it in the

2227
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:30,119
cup those guys didn't want anything to

2228
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:33,420
do with it yeah I knew it was going to

2229
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:37,859
win because the it was honor the goddess

2230
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:41,100
