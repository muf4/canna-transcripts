1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,219
welcome to breeder Syndicate this is

2
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:14,459
Matthew I wanted to do a quick talk

3
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:17,399
about our Punchy booster drop now it's

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,039
not a normal drop like most of our drops

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,079
and I tried to think of a way to

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,640
kind of walk everyone down this journey

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,139
with us

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,920
um while we're doing it we I've been

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,980
doing projects since the the initial and

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,020
second blue bonnet drop which was almost

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,539
I think three years ago now and I've

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,300
I've continued doing the work and

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,159
working through the lines

14
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,899
um we did some work with the the

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,519
blueberry McMuffins because I wanted to

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,739
see how that crossed

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,440
um what was in that line what was in the

18
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:52,259
the F gens of that and I was interested

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,899
in working that into other Bonnet lines

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,820
and and so forth so

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,859
um there's been projects going on in the

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,500
background people always ask what am I

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,739
up to and I don't really ever have great

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,340
answers because it just is

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,159
what it is like I you know like am I

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,200
gonna share that I'm doing boring stuff

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,880
right like going through lines is kind

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,280
of boring so I thought of a way to be

29
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,679
able to open this up to some of our our

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,000
our like patreon members and stuff that

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,759
want to go through some of this stuff

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,099
with me and it makes it I mean you don't

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,060
usually use testers and it makes it so

34
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:28,978
like

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,680
I can see the wider pool and all that

36
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,719
like you know I've always been one of

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,159
the people who pushes back on using any

38
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,340
sort of testing because I'd like to see

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,259
all the results myself but at this point

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,180
it's more of a fun journey through a

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,799
line I truly I I feel like I understand

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,118
it and

43
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,340
um yeah so I have some stuff written out

44
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,159
um hopefully it'll help illustrate some

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,320
of the the drop how it worked what we're

46
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,299
seeing what you can expect so you can

47
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,158
you can get an idea if you even want to

48
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,780
go on this journey and if this is

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,299
something you'd be into and if it is

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,718
which one of these lines would be

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,280
um suitable for you so during my journey

52
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,379
through the the several blueberry hunts

53
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,939
over 17 years of operating I've come to

54
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,620
some deep realizations

55
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,199
at some point when you've worked with

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,239
enough a line enough specifically the

57
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,639
blue bonnet line and how how it breeds

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,520
so to so many different clones that I've

59
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,079
worked with for just as long that it's a

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,659
completely predictable breeder for me

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,940
now I I it's rare

62
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,799
I don't think I've experienced even

63
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,500
superstar that I've worked with a ton

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,420
and understand and understand traits I

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,360
don't I can't read what it's going to

66
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,399
breed like like I can with blueberry

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,440
specifically

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,239
um if that explains that a little more

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,818
so I wanted to take the work further

70
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,700
into double and tripled up Bonnet

71
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,378
hybrids in a way ensuring constant steps

72
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,299
to work away from inbreeding which is

73
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:55,979
the blueberry breeding trap but because

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,840
it's so predictable I can cross it to

75
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,179
several known cuts and know how they

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,500
will cross this is a peek at some of

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,060
that work I've been doing with my

78
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,639
breeding Apprentice here locally space

79
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,560
invader he was one of the guys locally

80
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,899
that I met some years back that happened

81
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,878
to watch the show and be local and was

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,500
just super passionate about taking his

83
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,299
whole grow game to the next level by

84
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,519
learning breeding Hands-On and he's been

85
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,719
an excellent student we did a few

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,819
different crosses however we were

87
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,199
focusing on five main hybrids letting

88
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:24,179
people see the work that's been going on

89
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,579
over the last you know three years as we

90
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,900
dive deeper into these lines

91
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,879
uh

92
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,980
tester name number one these are all the

93
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,259
tester names nothing is um

94
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,818
solid just because like they weren't

95
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,158
ever meant to be released these are just

96
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,899
tag names [ __ ] like that

97
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,939
um creamy punch so this is the cream

98
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,620
cross to plunge Punchy blue stir the

99
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,939
cream's original name tester name was

100
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,920
Silverberry so a lot of people knew it

101
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,620
as that it would never had a big release

102
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,939
because uh and I'll explain uh when

103
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,620
doing the initial crosses of the blue

104
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,419
bonnet I wasn't giving the silver Pearl

105
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,980
mom at the at this point when I was

106
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,539
doing that even at this stage of

107
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,518
friendships we don't ask each other for

108
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,199
cuts it's gifted when people feel like

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,299
it and it's done out of respect on both

110
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,699
ends so it's not like a stingy type

111
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,280
thing it's just how it works

112
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,018
um I was given a few silver Pearl s1s a

113
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,120
bit before the drop was done by souvenir

114
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,739
seeds I found one of those that was a

115
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,420
taller version of the mother similar

116
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,939
nose in resin production just a bigger

117
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,339
apical Cola and not a squat so you're

118
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,620
about five and a half feet tall and was

119
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,758
so much faster than the mom uh but she

120
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,139
had beautiful resin production and

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,639
beautiful tert profile and most

122
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,978
importantly the high

123
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
she was put in the room as filler space

124
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,339
because I wanted to know what Bonnet

125
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,780
crossed to with one of the pearls

126
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,959
because it's one of my favorite shirt

127
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,399
profiles and bonnet inherently like I

128
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,899
was doing the bubbleberry and to me it

129
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,019
was a bubble gummy type

130
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:45,719
smell and um not like pink bubble gum

131
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,500
but a different type of gummy type smell

132
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,680
um

133
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,478
anyway yeah I I wanted to get it crossed

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,579
in some sort before catastrophe happened

135
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,159
I work I work on Murphy's Law we call it

136
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,079
riots law around here because it is so

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
constant the worst [ __ ] that can go

138
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,339
wrong well so I try to operate with that

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,720
in mind uh so I made these seeds but it

140
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,000
was asked not to let anyone grow them or

141
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
sell them at the original perfect Pearl

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,180
Blue Bonnet cross

143
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,100
um

144
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,240
let's see I waited a few years and

145
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,160
eventually was given permission to let

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,840
them out and sub Rob did a beautiful

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,400
grow of some Stellar individuals that

148
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,198
were right in the middle silver Pearl

149
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,879
and bought it just extreme resin

150
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,340
production and a berry take on the

151
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,659
beautiful bubble gummy baby boo I've

152
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,418
never smelled the baby poo but everyone

153
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,300
else does so I'm just gonna say it's

154
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,680
there for most people right it's it I

155
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,120
just don't smell it

156
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,160
um with a stellar Buzz that calls back

157
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,860
to the Mexicans of old I definitely see

158
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,720
why neb spent uh and Neville spent his

159
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,240
later years searching for Hawkins that

160
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,860
reminded him of the early Pro work it's

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,620
absolutely my favorite work with Nevin

162
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,600
Rob and it stood the test of time we

163
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,340
took the best selection from the cream

164
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,780
and I believe there were four females

165
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,579
that hovered right around the similar

166
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,379
expression that we liked

167
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,478
um they should read similar but only one

168
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:00,300
way to find out

169
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,180
now this Punchy mail that we used for

170
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,160
all the all the Hybrids was selected

171
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,019
using trait selection method visual

172
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,120
trait ID I did When selecting the blue

173
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,159
bonnet mail the vegetative material

174
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,079
smelled like blueberry way more than any

175
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,139
of the other bonnets or the countless

176
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,038
other blueberry iterations that run

177
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,199
um

178
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,959
he simply has all of his family sticking

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,400
up at 75 80 degree angles from top to

180
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,659
bottom looking like he's raising his

181
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,638
hands

182
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,520
and I've now selected that trait in the

183
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,199
white monit Punchy bubble Berry the

184
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,639
right Berry V2 and every single time

185
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,520
when I use a mail from any of those

186
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
lines that had any had that trait he

187
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,698
passes every single visual trait that

188
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,379
that Bonnet does

189
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,199
um that Bonnet male did I should say

190
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,879
even in his Punchy hybrids in these he

191
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,160
lets the banana punch offer in some

192
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,139
beautiful and much needed yield for some

193
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,300
super commercial viability because

194
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,978
Bonnet on its own is a delicate cushy

195
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,600
smaller yielding girl and these are

196
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:56,699
serious chonkers coming out of The

197
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,379
Punchy lines inspect a lot of grape and

198
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,080
blueberry with this really wild infusion

199
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:03,719
of bubble gum but not pink bubble gum

200
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,279
bubble gum and sickly sweetness that is

201
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,319
just coated in resin that's perfect for

202
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,959
bubble hash and washing The Punchy and

203
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,060
Bonnet lines are specifically bred to be

204
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,560
washed and The Punchy brought a level of

205
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,360
resin production to some of these lines

206
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,519
that's staggering even in the realm of

207
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,259
deep chunk standards for this hybrid

208
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,359
some of these clock in between seven to

209
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,220
nine weeks blueberry is fast as is

210
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,020
silver Pearl if you want to if you want

211
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,180
speed and flour and turnaround time with

212
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,038
insane quality this is the one this is

213
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,139
my Riot pick for all the Hybrids as

214
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,639
being the one most people will be

215
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,740
receptive to

216
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,478
all right The Punchy booster f2s tester

217
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,579
name Punchy twister

218
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,079
this one has been a journey well it

219
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:41,579
originally made The Punchy line I was a

220
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,918
bit dismissive of people's reception to

221
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,180
me using a clone like banana punch I'm

222
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,620
not adverse to using modern lines

223
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,500
however during the time I was more

224
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,180
focused on old stuff so it was a a bit

225
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,939
of a range you know a bit off the range

226
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,560
I love skunk tax cut he brought to me of

227
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,418
his selection of symbiotics banana punch

228
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,459
uh shout out to the homie who made the

229
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:02,159
punch Supernova Gardens too like he

230
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,680
doesn't get nearly enough credit and

231
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,180
he's just a wonderful Dude and despite

232
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,300
people hating on punch for its potency

233
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,459
they don't have a [ __ ] clue on this

234
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,379
and and what this can do for breeding

235
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,000
there's cuts that you grow to crop and

236
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,300
some of those are crappy breeders gelato

237
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,098
three or sorry gelato 33 best example uh

238
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,840
good for cropping But Trash for breeding

239
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:24,060
in my opinion it's fully inbred

240
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,439
commercial cookies at its worst and it

241
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,939
just evolves

242
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,439
um I've tried with it so I'm speaking

243
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,240
from experience as the first dummy to

244
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,918
make the s1s of those cuts and then

245
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,599
sometimes there's cuts that have more

246
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,098
value inside of them than can be seen

247
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,959
with the naked eye or observed by

248
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,759
smoking it sometimes it's the actual

249
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,098
genetic data inside that needs unlocking

250
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,718
with the perfect partner I find Grape

251
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,399
smells and blueberry jam smells to be

252
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,740
ideal Partners in a lot of cases with

253
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,778
this being the prime example I did

254
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,000
30-something Bonnet crosses overall in

255
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,278
the initial runs and um just to take a

256
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,720
few forward and it was a hard Choice The

257
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,700
Punchy f1s were given away as a

258
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,278
promotion to help start a seed bank for

259
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,560
a friend that no one has ever heard of

260
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,958
you know like you know how you do for

261
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:05,819
friends well that was one of these uh

262
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,259
that was how we got to see a bunch of

263
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,420
these dried out really fast and people's

264
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,559
minds were blown my mind was blown uh

265
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,079
the breeding potential of that banana

266
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,539
punch cut was unlocked and Game Genie I

267
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,180
I'm old that dates me I know but you

268
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,860
know game G by the Bonnet male and that

269
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,479
Bonnet mail is special and unique enough

270
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,180
to pass that linked visual trait with

271
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,740
raisleys Punchy booster f2s while

272
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,120
inherently being more diverse than the

273
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,399
original release will still hold very

274
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,919
true to the original looks and smells on

275
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,600
it is uniform and true breeding and for

276
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,039
several traits that and that really

277
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,019
tightens up the generations as a whole

278
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,360
so expect way more uniformity than

279
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,159
you're used to seeing in f2s we have

280
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,379
great Kool-Aid great fun dip blueberry

281
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,659
jam blueberry grape explosion double

282
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,399
grape Berry cheesecake all caked in

283
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,439
resin and beautiful shades of purple

284
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,360
like the folks love and demand at

285
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,519
seriously potent High delivers the THC

286
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,860
percent that all the uninformed custis

287
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,360
demand to have and the two percent for

288
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,620
bonnetwork is crushing the game right

289
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,360
now and regularly over three percent

290
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,639
total Terps and in some crosses over

291
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,278
seven and a half which is not an

292
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,039
exaggeration it's it's it's something

293
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,600
special about this line uh we're here to

294
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,980
break every tradition and idea of what

295
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,240
blueberry is and how it should have

296
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,620
always been

297
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,879
um flowering time with this one is going

298
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,440
to be eight to nine weeks the occasional

299
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,419
seven fast lady really proud of this

300
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,339
line and the work that every that's been

301
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:22,379
done by everyone leading up to it it's a

302
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,420
labor of love and one I'm very proud to

303
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:28,320
put my name on

304
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:31,139
um the another one we did was the the la

305
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,660
Kush Headband of nachos across the chem

306
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,580
dog d by CSI Humboldt

307
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,199
um and we crossed that to Punchy

308
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,700
blooster the tester name is not so

309
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,080
Punchy

310
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,640
um so the homie space invader was

311
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,360
already running and doing selections of

312
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,360
his own uh

313
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,078
when we were talking about starting

314
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,420
projects together and his growth of it

315
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:54,599
sold me on his capability the selection

316
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,458
of it is strong strong super strong it's

317
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,959
how a double up of Super Skunk goes

318
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,778
right and it happens often when you

319
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,939
introduce the LA Kush and not a Kush but

320
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,759
a super skunky sour diesel type that

321
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,980
natso dog calls headband and kebdog D we

322
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,958
are pretty sure it's chem 91 Super Skunk

323
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,700
however you know people have stories or

324
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,319
reputations to protect so we can pretend

325
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,778
I didn't say those parts out loud for

326
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,920
the sensitive folks over there and that

327
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:18,539
corner

328
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,399
um so right away I was like this makes

329
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:22,078
sense for the project both not so and

330
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,059
CSI are some of my closest friends on

331
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,919
Earth and we can make a line where we

332
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,179
could see all kinds represented

333
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,740
um if I could have found a way to

334
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,838
smuggle and pack in h l it would have

335
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,000
been perfect but obviously less uniform

336
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,380
uh we'll get there one day so what we

337
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,059
get here is a different take on the

338
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,220
Super Skunk double up great berry

339
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,018
explosion what occurs is usually a

340
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,060
middle ground of berry grape with booty

341
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,860
font mostly popping up with a lower

342
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,039
percent of bland diesel types with

343
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,839
pretty banging highs and not much Berry

344
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,179
and a small percent that are this

345
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,360
beautiful tiny little acrid Berry type

346
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:57,659
that are hardly yielding but you know 10

347
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,339
grams of plant but like this is this is

348
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:01,078
in small pots and stuff like that but

349
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,000
they're tiny little yielders

350
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,679
um given a proper veg time and root

351
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,778
space this expression pops up regularly

352
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,578
in lines like this the skunk spray can

353
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:10,919
Blue Bonnet sour Bonnet and a ton in the

354
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,000
day record diesel Blue Bonnets so if

355
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,278
you're a hunter and want to find

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,259
extremely triple dank head stash that

357
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,439
will like white out your friends check

358
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,360
out this line uh of or any of the others

359
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,700
above like a lot of times would be 8 11

360
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,259
weeks because a diesel type is involved

361
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,060
you will see the 11 weekers push their

362
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:31,019
way through from time to time

363
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,338
number four the GMO root beer Funk bag

364
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,078
seed

365
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,420
um not really bag seed but it's it's

366
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,859
it's an unknown I guess

367
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:41,399
um Across The Punchy booster we call

368
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,720
this what the [ __ ] bro WTF bruh because

369
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,919
like it's it was confusing right

370
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,360
um it took me a minute to remember

371
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,799
exactly what these seeds were that me

372
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,180
and skunk Tech had run through my seed

373
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,699
blowers of the house

374
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:55,919
you have one line of a hybrid

375
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,079
um with Mean Gene that I enjoyed called

376
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,939
GMO root beer funk

377
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,620
I'm a super black licorice and just

378
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,360
really Stony and strong

379
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,459
so a few years later I was cleaning out

380
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,680
old stuff and found the bag with a few

381
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:10,018
creamy seeds and said screw it let's

382
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,659
toss those in and see what comes of them

383
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,159
so they're amazing plants but the smells

384
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,259
were not in the direction I would have

385
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,480
anticipated and to be honest it reminds

386
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,220
me of a bland old Afghani line

387
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,959
at first I was disappointed because it

388
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,940
wasn't like anything turquoise I wanted

389
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,559
or was expecting

390
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,880
and I didn't want to sell this as a

391
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,619
blueberry root beer because honestly

392
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,838
that's not the the chirps that I'm

393
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,639
seeing you know in in the Expressions

394
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,579
we're using and that wouldn't be fair to

395
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,579
anyone involved right like anyway

396
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:41,039
um the customers Gene skunk techno so I

397
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:42,838
wanted to State here what we have is a

398
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,939
super potent blank canvas to apply

399
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,500
crunchy booster to and there's genetics

400
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,660
for the black licorice smells from the

401
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,259
root mirror reap boat

402
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:54,000
root beer GMO Funk are there

403
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,500
um it just takes a little dig and

404
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,559
there's extreme black licorice goodness

405
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,940
in those those mother plants

406
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,039
um

407
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,779
overall we decided it was a really good

408
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,219
and worth releasing despite the name

409
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,838
confusion and really felt like it

410
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,160
deserved a real transparent explanation

411
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,360
on the chirps and because one of my

412
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,740
favorite things in life is getting

413
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,600
emails from people telling me that

414
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,039
they're the first time Growers of my

415
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,300
stuff and for the first time they got a

416
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,819
plant that looks and smells like that

417
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,379
breeder said I love that and I'll live

418
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,180
for it because the first and foremost

419
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:23,039
I'm a grower and know how rare of an

420
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:24,659
experience that's become especially for

421
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,039
folks using cookies and gelato because

422
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,600
it all looks like Gelato at some point

423
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,419
to pop a pack of seeds and have potent

424
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,800
high in terms exactly as described since

425
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm new to these lines combined on the

426
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,039
mother's side the prediction scale is

427
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,720
completely unknown however I expect

428
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,519
purple is grape and Berry and tons of

429
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,259
resin to sneak in at any moment

430
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,899
flowering time would be somewhere

431
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:45,958
between eight to nine weeks um

432
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,299
it's super potent and worth exploring

433
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,239
it's just like I I

434
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:53,219
am very hesitant to not give full

435
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,740
transparency on it because of what it is

436
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,620
how it you know how it came to be and

437
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,419
that the name doesn't quite match

438
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,578
the genetics of the names don't quite

439
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:04,379
match what we saw but that's not a

440
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:07,439
representation on gene or anyone else

441
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,419
that was just a small pop of what was in

442
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,620
the bags anyways

443
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,599
um number five

444
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,740
so we call this one Friendly Fire for

445
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,019
now

446
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,299
um this is the first Bonnet triple

447
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,379
Extravaganza loose gittles crossed a

448
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,120
blue bonnet across the blueberry

449
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,338
McMuffins which is the Mac one blue

450
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,259
bonnet Across The Punchy booster banana

451
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,940
punch Blue Bonnet so three-way injection

452
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,679
this is the first time I brought three

453
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,779
of the Bonnet lines together one I love

454
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,299
the resin production on and ease of

455
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,860
growth on the Mac one I also like the

456
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,419
challenge of teaching people how to get

457
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,699
that clone to make Siege reliably for

458
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,198
them during the blueberry McMuffin F2

459
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:41,879
round I had popped in some of the very

460
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,319
few Skittles clone only crossed the

461
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,539
Bonnet seeds that looked viable enough

462
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,980
to pop I never popped that line or sold

463
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:48,659
it because so few seeds made it to

464
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,879
maturity because of the chaos and moving

465
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:52,740
grows Etc so I was stoked to see how it

466
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,659
combined with the Bonnet later on and in

467
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,820
a 10c pop for females were all Z

468
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,500
dominant in Terps the looks were clearly

469
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,600
so much better cell growth structure

470
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,879
stem wise with Skittles as well as

471
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,278
budget structure overall Beauty potency

472
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,620
but I couldn't bury that Skittles chirp

473
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,299
in one move with the bonnet so I figured

474
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,399
let's toss it into the Mac one Bonnet

475
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,899
Repro room when the Mac one took it back

476
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,458
seat to the Bonnet

477
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,740
um the hybrids of this are insanely

478
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,719
gorgeous looking like more compact cushy

479
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,519
versions of back one the chirps combined

480
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,040
with more Berry coming through but still

481
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,778
extremely Z dominant so the last fix in

482
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,278
my opinion would instead be to try The

483
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:28,078
Punchy round

484
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,659
um a line that is terp dominant to most

485
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,078
Turk donut to most with heavy grape and

486
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:36,480
Berry this project was done to not stack

487
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,099
height bees necessarily it was done with

488
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,480
the intention and goal in mind of

489
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,120
combining the winning looks of the Mach

490
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,180
1 cut some of the z-turp with the very

491
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,039
more of a dominant feature I stacked the

492
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,599
deck in my favor based on what I've seen

493
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,519
in my experience and using Bonnet and

494
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,259
blueberry to try to pull this one off

495
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,240
if you'd like

496
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,339
you could be one of the very few that go

497
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,139
on on this journey with us to see if we

498
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,180
met this goal or others in this project

499
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,320
I'm stoked to finally have a solid crew

500
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:02,758
of Good Growers to put all this stuff

501
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,459
out there to test and really give

502
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,160
unbiased opinions with this line expect

503
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,140
seven to nine weeks flowering time lots

504
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,759
of sea of green types more squat Afghani

505
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,319
looking things with beautiful colors and

506
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,599
just built for smooth washing

507
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,039
extractions and that pretty much covers

508
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,139
the um I don't want to say it's a drop

509
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,938
because like we're only letting some out

510
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,259
like we have a bunch of seeds we're

511
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,179
going through them ourselves and we're

512
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,740
letting just a few packs out while we're

513
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,640
going through them

514
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,740
um

515
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,340
people are interested so here's your

516
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,740
chance uh yeah um I want to thank

517
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:37,439
everyone you know this is a wild Journey

518
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,859
we've been on trying to reinstill like

519
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,538
interest in in genetics period like I

520
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,339
really feel like that was an art of

521
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:46,259
reading that's been lost interest in

522
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:47,579
breeding in general so people have a

523
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:49,200
better understanding of what they're

524
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,019
reading when when the seed makers say

525
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,660
they're doing certain moves or genetic

526
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:56,879
moves and and all the stuff so yeah I

527
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,600
hope I hope all this has been helpful I
