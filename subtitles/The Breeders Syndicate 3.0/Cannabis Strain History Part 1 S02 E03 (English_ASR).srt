we're going to talk about a few

20
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,560
different lines we're going to talk some

21
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,560
northern lights i believe i think we're

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
going to talk some uh widow which we've

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
never done

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,079
no not yet we haven't covered that we

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,478
probably should devote a full episode to

26
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,719
just the white family at some point but

27
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,719
um

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,239
yeah it definitely changed changed

29
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,719
everything post 95 yeah

30
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,919
is that a 95 thing

31
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,920
yeah it's a 95 thing yeah and it kind of

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,000
it kind of dominated

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,000
that and its hybrids for probably a good

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,560
well i mean at least at least the next

35
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,759
five or ten

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
you know it ended up winning it and its

37
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,080
children and its cousins and stuff won a

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,840
bunch of cups and it ended up getting

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
crossed to everything

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,239
everything known to man and fginned and

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,360
copied and renamed

42
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,439
oh yeah i mean i remember when um

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,599
there used to be this uh there used to

44
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,159
be this like harvest festival

45
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,000
uh that got thrown at the end of every

46
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,520
every season up by me and it was kind of

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,280
like word of mouth

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,800
is that the uh the ncga one yeah indeed

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,560
ten percent run ten percent round indeed

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,360
but i mean it was like a place where

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,840
like you know csi and and

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,239
flat like a lot of people

53
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,080
from like the forums

54
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,920
and you know that were movers and

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,120
shakers in both america and europe kind

56
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,878
of came out you know

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
and what's funny about that is like when

58
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,719
i first went to those things

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
i was like hoping

60
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,479
because i you know whatever it was 20

61
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
some years ago now so i was in my 20s

62
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,560
obviously i was hoping to meet like

63
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,318
old-timers like me

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
that had what that had things that i

65
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:08,958
wanted

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,560
right i was like oh i'm gonna get to go

67
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
this thing and i'm gonna meet all these

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
people

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,959
and it was like

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
everything that was popular on cannabis

71
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,759
world

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
bcga stuff

73
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,560
i mean you know and not that it was bad

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
but i just mean

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,400
blue widow

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,760
you know apollo 13 apollo 11 genius

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,959
um you know but but the but the two most

78
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:36,079
common things that were crossed then was

79
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,759
well the three where it's probably

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
the blue family

81
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,318
the white family and some stuff like

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,639
sweet tooth that was coming out of steve

83
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,639
yeah and we were taking family yeah

84
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,479
people were taking males of that stuff

85
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,878
and crossing it to everything

86
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,639
yeah literally everything so just about

87
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,318
everything there not everything there

88
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,798
but a lot of things there where some

89
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,359
combination of those three families bred

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,680
into everything else yeah

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
so there was white everything

92
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,519
so let's start with uh the white tails

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
do you want to start with shanti or

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,840
ingamar or somewhere in between

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,519
uh we can uh

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,959
we can start with

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,160
i guess we'll start with i guess we'll

98
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,319
start with shanti okay right

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,799
so what's an absolute fact

100
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,879
is like in 1995

101
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,599
uh neville and scentsy and that whole

102
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:29,199
crew they still kind of uh dominated the

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,160
scene right yeah and shanti

104
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,400
at the uh at the greenhouse label uh he

105
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,960
released white widow

106
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,918
right which had a combination of it was

107
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,359
different

108
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,079
than all the stuff that other p it

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,439
wasn't just a renamed rehashed thing

110
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,519
which is so common right now and but

111
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,240
back then in europe too right yeah it

112
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,198
wasn't a rehash it was something new and

113
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,560
it was a super frosty potent

114
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,000
um high thc afghani that crossed well

115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,399
with things

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,199
and it sort of turned cannabis on its

117
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,159
head

118
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
yeah i think it had a killer name

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,479
you know and that was like back in the

120
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,479
day when you'd get those like high times

121
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,719
with the super nice spreads for the

122
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,240
cannabis cups and like white everything

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,639
which just started being labeled

124
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
throughout all those winters it looked

125
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,879
gorgeous

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,879
um all that type of stuff so

127
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,199
so that's indisputable as shanti came

128
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,120
out with a seedline yeah about

129
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,120
everything else about it is is i guess

130
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
you could say is disputable uh there's

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,079
versions

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,199
that exist right uh there's one version

133
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,240
which shanti will tell you that he bred

134
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,520
it and it came from his stuff

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,879
yep and it and it's a you know and

136
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,639
you know that's that's where it came

137
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,639
from it came from his travels and his

138
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,240
stuff and he brought it there

139
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,240
there's another

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,879
there's another story that is kind of

141
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,759
proposed by like i guess arjun would be

142
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,399
it and ingmar and and pretty much all of

143
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,360
amsterdam is uh on the ingomar side as

144
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,758
as best i asked you know all the jokes

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,038
ingomar is this is this dutch gentleman

146
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,840
and supposedly in like 89 or 90 he was

147
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,879
smoking hash and out of the hash fell a

148
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,239
few seeds yeah which is pretty uncommon

149
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,279
but some it must have gotten just

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,240
pressed

151
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,679
in there or whatever yeah and so he

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,038
found this thing

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,160
that was

154
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,360
supposedly like uh maybe the cut of

155
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,039
white widow

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
and they started selling it at grow

157
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,079
stores

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
right and they started selling it to

159
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,199
friends and they started passing it

160
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,638
around

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,280
and um you know arjun claims that he

162
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,038
bought it from dude years before shanti

163
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,478
got involved

164
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,318
and all that yeah so where it came from

165
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,159
and who developed it and all that

166
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
there's kind of two camps and it depends

167
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
on who you talk to

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,639
all those dudes have beef with one

169
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,918
another

170
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,800
so it can be

171
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,240
kind of hard to uh get like

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
past the beef

173
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
but yeah definitely where it became what

174
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,799
made it famous

175
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,519
was it being released shanti releasing

176
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,759
another greenhouse label in 95. yeah and

177
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,000
and in fairness you're always good at

178
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,720
passing the beef dude

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
yeah you know i mean what's interesting

180
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
about that actually is that so when i

181
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
was a kid and i was going over to

182
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,478
amsterdam a bunch there was a bunch of

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,400
dudes then that were in their 40s now

184
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,560
they're in their 60s and 70s i guess

185
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,000
right yeah and they a lot of there was

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
camps just like we have now in

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,598
california there's people that had beefs

188
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
with each other they're people that felt

189
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,839
wronged on deals that went bad or

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,598
partnerships that went to skew or that

191
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,758
[ __ ] has my cut

192
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,159
or whatever the case may be

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
amsterdam in the 90s is actually like a

194
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,120
pretty good indicator

195
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,280
of cannabis and now

196
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,519
yeah it is yeah because humans are the

197
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,878
same yep like we don't change all that

198
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,959
much so all the same type of

199
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,280
interactions and all the same like well

200
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,598
you get credit you got credit for this

201
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,519
but it was really mine

202
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,839
you know that [ __ ] happens all the time

203
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,279
today right if i remember correctly too

204
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,758
peacemaker was another one that was

205
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,679
debated i think uh peacemaker was also

206
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,520
ingomar's peacemaker was also a great

207
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,160
white shark so they

208
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,959
made it over that i was at that cannabis

209
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,120
cup

210
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,638
uh when peacemaker won

211
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,680
and i think it's that's that's one of

212
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,519
the coolest names yeah it's a god it's a

213
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,199
really good it's it's shitty that they

214
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,439
got rid of it and turned it into a great

215
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
white shark yeah which is a cool name on

216
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,278
its own but it's like not quite

217
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,000
peacemaker which is now shark shock

218
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,719
right yeah so peacemaker

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
peacemaker became great white shark

220
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,039
and then greenhouse trademarked great

221
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
white sharks so you can't only

222
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,480
greenhouse can call strains that yeah

223
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,200
and then when uh shanti left he called

224
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
it

225
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
uh

226
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,839
you know shark shock

227
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,519
yeah so it's had you know like a lot of

228
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,200
cannabis strains it's had three or four

229
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,560
different names depending on what area

230
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,240
you're in

231
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,759
uh i went through hundreds of those

232
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,039
seeds

233
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,360
and uh

234
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,519
it's um that was a killer line i loved

235
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,278
it a lot actually yeah some of the most

236
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,560
potent weed i've ever smoked came out of

237
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,039
that line

238
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:16,159
but the weird part was is that i

239
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:19,120
i could get really skunky

240
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,278
like really terpy skunky ones that were

241
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
mild to moderate potency

242
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,519
and i could get super potent ones that

243
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
tasted like cool smoke

244
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,159
but i could never get

245
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,360
this the skunky super potent one in the

246
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,759
same plant

247
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,919
it sounds like that's a common um

248
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,200
kind of thing with yeah i don't i mean i

249
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,838
look like

250
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,080
i i kept one that i would i would

251
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,000
classify as turplus

252
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,080
yeah i think i've had an afghan kush

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,080
like that that was very turples i mean

254
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,240
it wasn't that bad it didn't have off

255
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,639
terps yeah no

256
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,839
but it was like the absence of flavor

257
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,240
yeah but it was so potent honestly like

258
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,240
it gave me tracers in my vision that i

259
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,159
kept it even because even though it

260
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,519
didn't taste like anything

261
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,838
like nothing

262
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,519
you know and so i i probably ran through

263
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,120
two three four hundred something like

264
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,879
that seats of

265
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,879
great white shark from greenhouse trying

266
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,639
to find because if i would have found

267
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,519
if you could have found a super potent

268
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,120
one with as skunky as some of them were

269
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
yeah

270
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,278
i mean that would have you know yeah a

271
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,399
lot of people's daily smoke yeah for

272
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:25,838
sure

273
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,120
but the white did that i mean that's

274
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,880
kind of like uh

275
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
i just called it the white but

276
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,559
you know so they're really getting

277
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,159
confused folks white widow

278
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,919
but yeah what the white widow was one of

279
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,159
those things where it's like kind of

280
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,838
like the nl line with neville it's it's

281
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,919
it's like it didn't have a lot of terps

282
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,320
but it was super potent and super pretty

283
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,838
and it added it made the bud look nicer

284
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
and it made it look frostier and it made

285
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,360
it look denser

286
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,278
all those things that growers like

287
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
and so people started blending it with

288
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,679
everything

289
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,480
you know

290
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,319
uh like blue widow was super famous

291
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,519
about 20 years ago during those parties

292
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,760
right because you got the if you could

293
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
get the terps from the blue and some of

294
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,278
the color and you could get the potency

295
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,320
from the other like it was a pretty good

296
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,159
marriage

297
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,839
yeah if you could get the frostiness and

298
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,879
resin production of the widow on the

299
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
blue

300
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,278
but yeah widow was one of those things

301
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,879
just like you know cookies or skittles

302
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,320
or something like that where like

303
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,240
everybody got it

304
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,879
and crossed it to everything they had to

305
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,320
see what would come up yep

306
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,838
that's kind of like it was one of those

307
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
type of strains yeah it was where all of

308
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,640
a sudden for me it was one of the first

309
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,839
like mega hyped name strings for my

310
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,679
generation

311
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,000
like uh i you know when we were first

312
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,439
getting bags of [ __ ] really good weed

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,759
everybody would call it either white

314
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,440
riot rider white rhino or white widow

315
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,519
whether it was or not but it was one of

316
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,600
the first ones in my generation that

317
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,000
really broke through with the names

318
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
shanti still sells white white rhino i

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
think he calls it medicine man or

320
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
something yeah

321
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,879
yeah something along those lines and

322
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,200
then like uh simon had white russian

323
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:01,439
which i liked a lot that's right was

324
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:05,040
which was uh ak-47 by white widow yep

325
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,360
um so yeah it got it was a greenhouse it

326
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,838
was at syria seeds

327
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,159
it was white labeled like crazy all the

328
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,920
canadians all the canadians had it and

329
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,399
crossed it into everything yeah um

330
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,719
so there was a yeah but blue widow was

331
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,958
probably like that was like two totally

332
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,120
unrelated families that liked each other

333
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,719
yeah that was some pretty good [ __ ] it

334
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,278
was a pretty good [ __ ] ron had a really

335
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,200
good cut of that that he'd pass around

336
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,639
yeah it was good and then people tons of

337
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
people had seed

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,200
of that it was pretty free seed trading

339
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,039
era it was before st it was before the

340
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,040
feminized revolution

341
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,319
yeah you know so it was all still male

342
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,039
based

343
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
and

344
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,480
old days when it was easy to [ __ ]

345
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,639
make seeds

346
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,240
it was easy to yeah i mean i

347
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,759
you i don't think i don't even know

348
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,959
anyone that's ever had a failure with a

349
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,200
male

350
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,879
uh yeah i don't either um

351
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,480
i mean you'd have to

352
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,639
i mean you could have one or two males

353
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,120
in your room and hit it with a stick at

354
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,600
the right time and get 100 pollination

355
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,519
everywhere exactly the amount of effort

356
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,680
that people go through now to like make

357
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,320
sure they get enough pollen

358
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,399
out of reversals

359
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,000
and then even with that and all still

360
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
the failure rate and all that but that

361
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
back then it was like yeah you picked

362
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,560
your best couple males

363
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,720
but it was like what do you call it uh

364
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,159
you call it shock the shotgunning method

365
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,839
yeah because you don't really know what

366
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,719
the mail is going to do to you crack the

367
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,959
seeds yeah so you're just kind of you

368
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,759
know everything is placed until you run

369
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,479
it

370
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,319
everything's yeah you know and so

371
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,440
so yeah so the white widow is like the

372
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,920
story is either shanti bredit

373
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
uh which is like and shanti still sells

374
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,838
it

375
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,919
or

376
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,600
uh it was a clone that got found in

377
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,479
afghanistan in

378
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,199
hash

379
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,440
yeah and was sold as a clone

380
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,799
um so maybe they're both true

381
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,360
in a way

382
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,319
because someone had to take it and and

383
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,320
make a seed line from it

384
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
at some point i think both of them

385
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,278
claimed that there was brazilian in it

386
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,320
too

387
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,039
there was some kind of brazilian sativa

388
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,480
mixed in and if you look at like the

389
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,120
if you look at all those picks and all

390
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,440
the phenos you're getting from the 90s

391
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,560
it was pretty heavily influenced by the

392
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,639
afghan side of things sure yeah but the

393
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,198
black widow now that you can get from

394
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,360
shanti people find all kinds of sativa

395
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,519
expressions in those so

396
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
i don't really i mean you know it's prob

397
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,759
the the parents probably changed at some

398
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,278
point oh what a long time to keep cuts

399
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,439
i would imagine you know i mean none of

400
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,278
those none of those none of those

401
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,040
none of those euros ever admit that they

402
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,919
lost anything but uh

403
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,759
yeah

404
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,958
no they don't you know you ask scentsy

405
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,360
or whatever and they still have all the

406
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,359
same original parents you know

407
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,440
yeah so sure

408
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,240
but yeah i mean white white widow was

409
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,600
that was that was a game changer as far

410
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,198
as that goes

411
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
one of the biggest during its time one

412
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,120
of the biggest

413
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
well yeah i mean it kind of it kind of

414
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,240
replaced skunk one

415
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,160
as the the primary thing that people

416
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,120
crossed

417
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,600
you know because that's what would

418
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,440
happen in amsterdam it's like some new

419
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,920
amazing thing would come out and

420
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,000
everybody would buy seeds of it

421
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,000
and then mix it with their own [ __ ] and

422
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,159
try to get on the same sales type oh

423
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,360
yeah like they do now

424
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,198
like they do not mean it's like a

425
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
standard operating procedure and then

426
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,919
that's even why people should know that

427
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,839
too right is that like that's even why

428
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,240
some of the old-time breeders and stuff

429
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,560
they get all sketchy about telling you

430
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,480
actual lineage

431
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,159
because they know that whatever lineage

432
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
they say is just going to end up on some

433
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,198
competitor's pack

434
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
yeah

435
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,958
so you know shanti gets out there and

436
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
says oh it's this by this by this and

437
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,000
this is what we did to it and then that

438
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
exact

439
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,078
thing is is on his is two or three other

440
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,759
seed companies

441
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,799
yeah they're using you know so a lot of

442
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,320
times people like it it sucks like but

443
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,559
we went from like neville and some

444
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,800
people like that being very direct

445
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,039
to today where people hide the secret

446
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:14,399
sauce yeah

447
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,319
yeah it still doesn't make any sense um

448
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,440
i i you know when i see people hiding

449
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,079
their lineage it tells me usually if if

450
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,600
it's a seed maker or a breeder that's

451
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,000
hiding the lineage it just tells me that

452
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,920
they're they don't understand how

453
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,839
expression works or any of that because

454
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,759
you there's no reason to even try to

455
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,839
hide that kind of stuff you can't make

456
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,919
the same thing happen twice and people

457
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,480
get the same exact expressions twice you

458
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:41,519
know no i mean that's real weird things

459
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,079
i just think i i think it's an ego thing

460
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,159
yeah people people like the illusion

461
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,239
that people did a lot more work before

462
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,480
they release those seeds to you

463
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,839
yeah that that's that is true that's i

464
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,440
mean i'm not saying that's everybody but

465
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,959
that definitely percolates through the

466
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,040
seed [ __ ] world as far as i'm

467
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,198
concerned yeah it is

468
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,958
people people people

469
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,439
don't like accidents they want it to all

470
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:07,119
be intentional and you know private

471
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,120
genius that they reveal to the world

472
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,798
chat right now

473
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,918
these guys are killing me

474
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,919
the old j cash

475
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,000
you know and yay jan cash i mean i

476
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,519
suppose i i never saw any uh i never saw

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,279
any seeds come out of hash but that

478
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,798
doesn't mean it's not possible

479
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,240
yeah sure especially back then when they

480
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,839
were just whipping [ __ ] they weren't

481
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,720
really filtering it none of that kind of

482
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,720
[ __ ]

483
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,038
uh compressing the block yeah but i mean

484
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,360
it it happens back then

485
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,919
i mean 90 you know and and i you know i

486
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,678
will say that like that area of europe

487
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,120
was the primary

488
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,000
export area for that for hashish from

489
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,399
afghanistan yeah like there's an old

490
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,720
hash smoking culture in northern europe

491
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,798
over there and so they did have a bunch

492
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,558
of like that was america got much

493
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,079
shittier hash

494
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,119
than europe

495
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,359
yeah

496
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,558
late to the hash game you're europe well

497
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,399
not only that but there was like an

498
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,079
overland route

499
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,600
that was traditional and been there for

500
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,918
a long time there wasn't oceans in the

501
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,959
way that you could get there via land

502
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,360
you know and through a bunch of

503
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,319
countries that weren't as hardcore about

504
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,959
searching for [ __ ] is america yeah uh i

505
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,558
we got seagrade hash most of the time

506
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,480
i didn't even realize how good

507
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,160
traditional hash could be until i got to

508
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,120
amsterdam and started meeting certain

509
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
people

510
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,558
yeah you know

511
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,760
really eye opening

512
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,160
all right before i derail this

513
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,599

i'm starting them at 200 and then we're

517
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,480
going to go back to talking so i'll just

518
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,558
pin it as we go

519
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,400
and uh as it gets higher i'll add more

520
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,240
[ __ ] in but i don't want to derail the

521
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,919
conversation too much

522
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,960
so yes banana tie 200 banana tie at 200.

523
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,000
yeah

524
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,200
there we go

525
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,480
there we go

526
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,160
so

527
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,919
so yeah i mean i don't know we um

528
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,000
you know i don't i i don't even think i

529
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,759
think white widow was probably

530
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,319
the widow family was probably the

531
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,359
primary thing until kind of like the

532
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,960
sour and diesel wave yeah i think it was

533
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,959
happening

534
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,640
you know and then and then kush came

535
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,558
kind of quickly behind that like kush

536
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,880
had been around for a minute but like in

537
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,119
order to become popular enough people

538
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,440
have to have it yeah and it was very

539
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,279
hard so you know i mean that's that's

540
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,038
that's the weird thing it's like there

541
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,720
was all this [ __ ] with like the chem you

542
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,480
know but it took so long because there

543
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,519
was only like four of us in california

544
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,919
that had it

545
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,918
yeah so like how many how you know how

546
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,160
many can like four garages and a couple

547
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,960
light depths and and whatever else even

548
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,400
do

549
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,240
i think people underrate how much um

550
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,160
the can of bible came into play during

551
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,400
this time during that era right at the

552
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,200
end of the the widow era into the kush

553
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
era um in popularizing a lot of these

554
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,480
strains that people had never heard of

555
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,038
smoked seen before stuff that that was

556
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,079
held super tight

557
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,919
i mean jason uh jason king was at those

558
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,199
was at those events

559
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,720

561
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,919
then

562
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,079
um and actually like in especially in

563
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,960
the second and third kind of bible

564
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:17,439

575
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,399
especially like

576
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,000

era that that was acceptable so you kind

581
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,119

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,159
things or something like that that we're

593
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,839
all in there the pineapple mothership

594
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,039
was that one that you grew

595
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,038
yeah the the uh i'm in mendo somebody

596
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,519
just asked that the mothership is kind

597
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,558
of a crazy story dude i should tell it

598
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,639
just because people would trip out so

599
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,359
jason king had this girlfriend

600
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,159
at the time and she was from

601
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,079
uh the mountains of north carolina

602
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,600
right asheville all that and as most

603
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,199
people probably know asheville is kind

604
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,599
of like it's a little different than the

605
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,038
rest of northern north carolina it's a

606
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,959
little bit more hippie it's a little bit

607
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,879
more eclectic and all that

608
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,200
and so they had this uh

609
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,720
they had this uh strain out there they

610
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
called the mothership

611
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,839
right and so

612
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,960
he uh

613
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,798
um she was gonna get it shipped out here

614
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,960
because it was this old ascetiva that we

615
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,839
wanted to try right yeah so i agreed

616
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,079
they ship it out and uh

617
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,199
again i'm i'm thinking to myself it's

618
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,199
going to come and it's going to be you

619
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,400
know a couple clones and a little box

620
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,120
yeah and this is this has got to be

621
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,200
o2 or something like that so long before

622
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,918
smartphones or like checking your

623
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,120
package online like you know just

624
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,759
mailed it and when it showed up it

625
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,639
showed up right yeah so

626
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,240
i'm expecting this little box of clones

627
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,080
and i opened the door one day and

628
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,519
there's this box that's like two feet

629
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,678
tall

630
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,440
on my doorstep

631
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,600
i'm like [ __ ] so i take it inside i have

632
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,679
no idea what the hell it is and i open

633
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,279
it up and there's two plants a mother

634
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,038
ship in there

635
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,399
in dirt pots

636
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,240
staked

637
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,200
you know and they're like they're like

638
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,519
you know 22 24 inches tall each one of

639
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,240
them there's two full one gallon pots

640
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,599
with

641
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,759
two foot plants

642
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,599
bent over in there yeah and then they

643
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,599
tamp down a bunch of packing material

644
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,319
and stuff so the dirt didn't fall out

645
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,639
yeah so instead of mailing us cuts or

646
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,960
like unrooted snips or any of like the

647
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,280
modern tech or whatever they literally

648
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,600
mailed us two two foot tall plants in

649
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,319
one gallon pots

650
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,000
that's one way to do it yeah they both

651
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,918
lived yeah

652
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,079
and all those all those pictures in the

653
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,080
can of bible of mothership

654
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,519
um they all pretty much come from those

655
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,759
two moms

656
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,960
so what was in mothership do you know i

657
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,558
have no idea no clue no no clue i didn't

658
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,519
even like it that much to be perfectly

659
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,759
honest

660
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,079
uh it has some off like i know it still

661
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,079
exists which is cool yeah just because i

662
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,519
don't think it's related to much else

663
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,599
but yeah

664
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,679
it did this neat thing where it grew all

665
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,839
these golf balls all over it

666
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,278
and the thing was super floppy but it's

667
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,158
the only plan i've ever seen that it

668
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,240
would like flop over like 50 percent

669
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,159
and then just hold itself up and grow

670
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,839
sideways

671
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,440
so like you really didn't need to stake

672
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,119
it it would flop

673
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,519
but then its stem would like catch

674
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,119
itself and instead of snapping

675
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,720
you know or just hitting the dirt or

676
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,479
something like that it would hold itself

677
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,200
up and so if you grew it in a greenhouse

678
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,038
or indoor it would grow sideways through

679
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,720
your plants and it would weave itself

680
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:11,919
through other plants you had that's

681
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
[ __ ] weird

682
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,759
yeah it was it was really it was like

683
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,240
the it was a really unusual trait it's

684
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,000
it's stems didn't want to snap and they

685
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,120
would give and then bring themselves

686
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
back up

687
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,879
yeah that's interesting but that was

688
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,120
kind of in that era

689
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,039
where weed was weak

690
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,439
yeah like it hadn't real that was even

691
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,440
before like the purple craze where urkel

692
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,360
and grape ape and granddaddy and all

693
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,759
that [ __ ] kind of took over yeah that

694
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,038
was sort of like the last era

695
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,079
where

696
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:45,278
people like any any type of quality weed

697
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,199
that people grew sold easily

698
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,159
yeah right so people grew whatever they

699
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
wanted so was it a sativa type height to

700
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,960
it

701
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
traditionally

702
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,360
traditionally sativa type high you know

703
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,919
it had fox tailey buds

704
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,439
was it long flowering or not it wasn't

705
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,120
particularly long flowering like 11

706
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,558
weeks or something like that

707
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,798
and if you grew it outdoor you kind of

708
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,918
wanted to let it ride till you know

709
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,158
halloween

710
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,159
but in mendo and lake county and stuff

711
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,720
like that it was uh it wasn't that

712
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,720
wasn't that hard to achieve yeah there's

713
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,038
lots there was lots of weed most most

714
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,880
good weed in my opinion was done between

715
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,960
the 15th of october and early november

716
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,960
at least where i was where i'm from

717
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,960
so people are asking for the not so dog

718
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,240
story the name of not so dog we got to

719
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,558
do it one more time

720
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,240
the name of not so dog yeah oh man

721
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,278
um

722
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,798
maybe i'll give the edited version

723
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,159
so the edited version is uh my buddy who

724
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,960
gave it to me

725
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,559
um also gave it to he gave it to a

726
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,919
couple other people right not very many

727
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,359
people had there was like four of us he

728
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,799
gave it to uh

729
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,399
skunk va

730
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,158
you know uh he gave it to it got to um

731
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,519
you know i see collective it got there

732
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,400
was a couple up there but there wasn't

733
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,400
it was like four maybe five at the most

734
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,000
who had it and so we used to do this

735
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,759
thing where

736
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,880
not everybody had fresh wheat all the

737
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,960
time

738
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,760
so we'd keep each other in the loop

739
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,840
about who had what coming down when

740
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,919
yeah so this person could grab a couple

741
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,079
ounces this person can grab qp or

742
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,240
whatever so you'd have smoke so you have

743
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,359
fresh smoke you know yeah and so my

744
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,640
buddy from new york he goes up to tahoe

745
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,439
to grab

746
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,720
um we call the tahoe dog

747
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,120
right yeah

748
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,880
and it grew killer up there because it's

749
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,038
so cold

750
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,480
that the air that he would especially in

751
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,759
winter the air that he would bring into

752
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,159
his grow room would be like in the

753
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,960
single digits of the teens

754
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,360
and it would make that [ __ ] frost up

755
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,120
like really strong like it looked like

756
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,678
compared to mendo and sonoma where the

757
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,798
rest of us were like that mountain weed

758
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,000
was like

759
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,679
it was nice

760
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,759
it was really nice i had the same effect

761
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,120
in chicago in the wintertime like

762
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,720
there's something about bringing in

763
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,199
frigid air

764
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,519
that just makes like

765
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,519
makes it it's like a reactionary thing i

766
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,599
don't know yeah so anyway he goes up

767
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,119
there he goes up there to get this he

768
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,359
goes up there to get a like a pound of

769
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,879
dog yeah right and he's and he's

770
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,399
supposed to split it with me and so he

771
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
comes back and i was living we were

772
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,798
living in uh willows at the time which

773
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,960
is in northern mendo and he's like dude

774
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,960
come meet me and get this thing

775
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,240
so i come meet him and we're like it's

776
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,798
the middle of winter and we're off on

777
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,079
this side road and he hands me the bag

778
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:30,960
and he goes tell me what you think

779
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,639
there's something there's something a

780
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,558
little different this time and i opened

781
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,240
the bag and i stuck my hand in this bag

782
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,200
and i started smelling it

783
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,720
and i was like this is not so dog

784
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,240
and he's like what do you mean he's and

785
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,440
i'm like it's not so dog and he's like i

786
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,798
don't get what you mean and i'm like i'm

787
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,038
smelling it and it doesn't smell like

788
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,200
the dog yeah it smells like not it's not

789
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,240
so i don't get the

790
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,840
and it turns out that homie had

791
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,079
homie had uh

792
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,079
mislabeled a cut

793
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,000
and then kept that cut as a mom oh

794
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,798
that's the worst and then it was

795
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,319
actually like it was actually romulan

796
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,798
and that's why dude from new york was

797
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,398
tripping because it was so frosty and so

798
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,918
different yeah

799
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,678
he just thought he did this weird thing

800
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,360
and he crushed it and he brings it to me

801
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,880
and i'm like like in the dark i hadn't

802
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,479
even seen it yet i didn't even know what

803
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,880
it looked like i just stuck my face in

804
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,319
the bag and i was like it's not

805
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,520
and so

806
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,720
fast forward right and uh i'm trying to

807
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,119
uh

808
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,319
i'm trying to join uh

809
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,839
instagram

810
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,079
because everybody was bugging me that i

811
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,398
needed to climb out from under my rock

812
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,398
yeah and join instagram right and so i'm

813
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,439
trying to join and every [ __ ] name i

814
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,678
pick is already chosen

815
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,600
so after about 20 or 30 tries i get all

816
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,559
pissed off and i think well what if i

817
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,599
try this and i put in not so

818
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,119
and

819
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,199
that wasn't taken

820
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,479
there you go there you go so it was kind

821
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,919
of like it was just kind of like an

822
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,599
inside joke

823
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,440
about how when homie i mean he got it

824
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,278
back we gave him the dog back yeah

825
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
amongst us there was like it never got

826
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,558
lost

827
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,759
but there was individuals

828
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:07,519
that lost it briefly yeah and they had

829
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,158
to get it back from one of the other of

830
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,879
us over that time period you know but it

831
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,520
never

so busy with harvest and all that that i

844
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,879

bagged it and put it away you know and

846
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,559
then i dug it all out

847
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,000
i think it was me and a few of our

848
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,000

850
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,599
and we dug out like 40 or 50 kinds of

851
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,399
weed and jarred it up and brought it all

00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,439
people are like dude do you know what

865
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,960
the bubba is

866
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,080
and i was like yeah i know what the

867

868
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,480
they're like what is this weed

869
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,640
[ __ ] i don't know and the weirdest part

870
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,519
of that thing was on top of all that

871
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,399
weed

872
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,440
there was a big fat nugget trinity yeah

873
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,199
yeah

874
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,880
but it wasn't there was only one nug of

875
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,880
that trend on top of it and then the

876
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,640
rest of it was all [ __ ] yeah it was all

877
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,799
that other that was like some light

878
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,159
terpenoline minzy

879
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,639
yeah it was not it was not a great

880
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,480
expression no that whatever that was was

881
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,519
not a great expression of cannabis in

882
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,120
general yeah no no that was some mids i

883
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,960
loved the fact that it was that dude's

884
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,599
selection though

885
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,278
yeah his personal selection

886
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,278
i mean you know when you when you only

887
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,720
when you only pop 10 or 15 seeds or

888
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,440
something like that it's really hard to

889
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,759
find a winner yeah yeah that and that

890
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,440
and like you know things do change from

891
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,240
seed to clone and

892
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,240
as time goes maybe it was cool as a as a

893
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,120
seedling but it really was not cool as a

894
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,720
gun or something something no no and

895
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,759
that was we were lucky though that was

896
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,919
really the only thing that was

897
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,158
mislabeled out of all that work yeah and

898
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,320
that magical trinity nugget right that

899
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,240
magical that magical and that that threw

900
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,759
us off even more because that thing was

901
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,480
so different you know yeah we're like

902
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,240
what the [ __ ] did how did this trinity

903
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,079
get in here

904
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,000
yeah but i mean we had i mean that that

905
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,678
year i think we had

906
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,839
i had two six foot by 26 foot beds that

907
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,240
i just grew like all the mother stock

908
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,000
and all the head stash yeah

909
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,558
those two years in a row i think i did

910
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,519
that yeah so when i brought all that

911
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:01,278
work down to uh down to that party so

912
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,798
there was literally like probably like

913
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,720
40 flavors or something i don't know

914
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,798
yeah it was wild every time you have

915
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,159
pictures of that both parts

916
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:09,679
yeah

917
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,200
it was wild and some of it i didn't

918
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,360
bring because it wasn't done

919
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,278
yeah that's right

920
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,398
yeah i think the 91 wasn't done at that

921
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,159
point

922
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,398
no i didn't bring the i brought the chem

923
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,000
d yeah yeah i remember you bringing the

924
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,959
chem d especially the second time when

925
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,798
resin got the the white hot sweats

926
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,480
that was that was actually pretty weird

927
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,558
because you always you always talk about

928
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,480
things you know and like just so people

929
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,079
know when they're listening you know we

930
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,000
have we have friends from all over and

931
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,240
stuff and we chat on discord and some

932
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,679
different things and so you talk about

933
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,399
all this weed but it's not like you get

934
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,240
to smoke all your buddies weed

935
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,038
because we're a pretty like dispersed

936
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,558
group

937
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,640
you know there's people there's friends

938
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,038
of ours from all over the country all

939
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,640
over california and so a lot of times

940
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,879
like we gather up and it would be some

941
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,200
of these people's first chance to smoke

942
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,760
like some of this stuff

943
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,240
yeah you know and that that chem d that

944
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,398
i did inside i grew it under ceramics

945
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,480
ceramic metal halides

946
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,278
and it it it put a few people on the

947
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,278
couch not being able to speak yeah you

948
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,720
know uh one of the one of the our friend

949
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,839
resident was one of the very first

950
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,000
people to grow o.g kush in l.a

951
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,000
uh he got so high off sharing a joint

952
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,200
that he almost decided to go to bed and

953
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,599
call it a night

954
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,679
yeah remember that he recovered

955
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,278
yeah all of a sudden he's like just

956
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,960
sitting there sweating for like 30

957
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,759
minutes just kind of and then he just

958
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,558
goes i'm back fellas i'm out of the blue

959
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,558
yeah they just all stick with our pants

960
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,240
so that was really uh that was that yeah

961
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,359
that's kind of cool too because a lot of

962
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,440
times like

963
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,879
you know you can smoke good weed and i

964
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,640
don't care what kind of weed it is

965
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,840
eventually you build some level of

966
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,679
tolerance to that specific stuff

967
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,918
but if you've never smoked it before you

968
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,519
haven't smoked it months and you smoke

969
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,120
something different you know like we're

970
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,960
going to talk about the

971
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,759
the the headband cut that i have in a

972
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,759
bit

973
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,038
like that that we will get you high

974
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,960
every day

975
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,480
all day long yeah but if you haven't

976
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,480
smoked it in two or three months or

977
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,559
longer and you smoke that weed the first

978
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,320
four or five ten times you smoke it it's

979
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,358
like different

980
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,559
yeah

981
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:13,279
and there's a lot of weed that's like

982
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,199
that

983
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,679
yeah i think you know that like if

984
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,799
you're not whatever it's cannabinoids an

985
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,480
entourage effect or whatever combination

986
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,440
it just like your body's not used to it

987
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,440
and so it hits you a little bit

988
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,720
different yeah it could even be you're

989
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,480
in a different house different

990
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,559
environment all kinds of things go into

991
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
that for me so somebody was saying i

992
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,480
missed that kind of butt it's not around

993
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,358
like that and you're kind of right but

994
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,320
it it is around but it's like people's

995
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:40,559
uh

996
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,838
what people pick has changed

997
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,078
yeah you're not going to find that in

998
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,519
mostly in cookies hybrids it's just

999
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,760
you know you're like

1000
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,440
most people like 20 years ago the only

1001
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,919
reason why things were elite was because

1002
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,320
enough smokers liked them

1003
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,239
yeah right that was pretty much it and

1004
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,160
now it's a lot based on testing and

1005
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,279
looks and height and other various

1006
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,279
aspects

1007
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
so there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

1008
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,040
flash in the pans or mids or whatever

1009
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,359
they get pushed

1010
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,519
you know um where you know back in the

1011
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,838
day it's like i don't not even everyone

1012
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,400
had to say it was an elite yeah but

1013
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,480
enough smokers who were respectable were

1014
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,680
like this weed is fire yeah and then it

1015
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,960
would kind of become generally

1016
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,960
acceptable

1017
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,240
that whatever that was

1018
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,079
is fire

1019
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,959
yeah you know

1020
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,440
and uh the you know the name strain game

1021
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,800
has been really bad for diversity

1022
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,000
sure has

1023
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,640
sure has

1024
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,559
you know so i remember

1025
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,078
one of those years um

1026
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,679
i think it was uh denali brought now i'm

1027
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,440
used to smoking blueberries and stuff

1028
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,598
and i'm used to them being you know ant

1029
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,079
anxiety for me and chill and he brought

1030
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,838
out some old right berry og across to

1031
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,079
g13 hash plant seeds i've made a long

1032
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,400
time ago and he grew it and he handed me

1033
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,800
a do with that i got the coke shits i

1034
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,480
remember just like walking up in that

1035
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,440
house that first house like up the

1036
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,519
stairs like yeah that was [ __ ] up

1037
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,679
there's some [ __ ] that'll get you that's

1038
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,159
actually one of the things like even uh

1039
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,639
when i was talking about those those uh

1040
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,639
those ron parties 20 years ago

1041
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,639
is if you show up an event and you smoke

1042
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,639
10 or 15 or 20 kinds of weed you're not

1043
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,000
used to smoking you're gonna get some

1044
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,199
odd effects

1045
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,159
yeah

1046
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,319
you know one second um drowning with

1047
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:25,679
dagon i don't know how to pronounce that

1048
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,519
yes that is the one with juicy fruit

1049
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,399
tying it and it's up for auction right

1050
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,400
now at 2 20.

1051
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,919
uh someone says

1052
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,559
someone says you're growing if you're

1053
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,599
growing the headband and candy

1054
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,599
[Laughter]

1055
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,000
advice and people are asking about

1056
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,359
advice on the headband

1057
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,119
i don't really i mean

1058
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:46,880
those are two of like what i consider to

1059
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,640
be like the most potent strains i

1060
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,599
personally have

1061
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,960
so

1062
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,440
um

1063
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,559
you know there's a lot i i would just

1064
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,960
try to find plants you like

1065
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,880
you know i mean as far as effect goes

1066
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,199
that's me that's generally speaking the

1067
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,960
advice i always give is it's like

1068
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,118
what to try to find something you

1069
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,559
personally like

1070
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,720
you know when and when you're when

1071
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,039
you're sprouting seeds everyone's brain

1072
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,480
chemistry is vastly different so yeah

1073
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,159
find something you like

1074
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,800
yeah i mean there's there's things that

1075
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,920
like i love personally and matt would

1076
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,079
despise as a daily smoker oh yeah

1077
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,720
you know and csi and i don't have the

1078
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,640
same tastes at all when it comes to

1079
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,480
he recognizes like we have the same

1080
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,000
taste as far as like what we think of as

1081
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,000
good weed

1082
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,559
but what we are preferences and what we

1083
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,719
like to smoke are very different yeah i

1084
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,400
think um urkel even hits in the same way

1085
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,799
that it hits me whereas we like to breed

1086
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,720
with it a lot we like to grow it a lot

1087
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,400
but [ __ ] we will not smoke it because

1088
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,879
everything with it gives us [ __ ]

1089
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,559
panic attacks every [ __ ] time people

1090
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,358
are talking about flowering time so the

1091
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,920
chem d is usually like a

1092
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,440
i would say it's anywhere from like uh

1093
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,480
eight and a half to

1094
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,480
nine weaker ten weaker at the most

1095
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,000
um and the la is more like a 10 or 11

1096
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,838
most of the time

1097
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,039
so most of your phenos are probably

1098
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,119
going to come in that like 9 to 11 range

1099
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,119
and if it's real squat and afghan

1100
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,280
looking it probably leans d

1101
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,640
if it's tall and lanky it probably leans

1102
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,839
a little bit more of the headband yeah

1103
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,239
you know

1104
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,719
and we have some of the um

1105
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,959
the the la cush coming up probably going

1106
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,719
to be crossed to the nl5

1107
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,320
um the second round

1108
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,639
of the nl5 stuff you're doing some

1109
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,119
hybrids with it as well as nuts let's

1110
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:40,480
talk about your maui

1111
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,960
so the maui the maui is a cool story

1112
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,880
in the sense that it goes like way back

1113
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,920
so we uh

1114
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,119
in uh 1994

1115
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,039
which seems eons ago now i guess yeah we

1116
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,760
had just me and my crew had just kind of

1117
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,279
turned adults and back then it's like

1118
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,280
and especially in the midwest where i

1119
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,359
was from that's where you went to go get

1120
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,839
good weed

1121
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,679
seeds was amsterdam right yeah and so we

1122
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,119
all flew out to amsterdam

1123
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,719
and uh

1124
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,559
the short version of the story is we

1125
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,480
bought a bunch of seeds

1126
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,159
and we were in this coffee shop and

1127
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,240
there was this old man who was probably

1128
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,399
like in his 40s or whatever but to us

1129
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,479
when we're late teens and he seemed

1130
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,320
ancient i'm sure and we literally like

1131
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,159
shared a cappuccino and shared a couple

1132
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,240
joints and shot the [ __ ] for 20 or 30

1133
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,960
minutes and he told us that he was from

1134
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,479
america and he came out he was from maui

1135
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,639
and he came out and he traded he was

1136
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,800
trading seeds with uh some of the dudes

1137
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,838
in europe and he did it every few years

1138
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,800
right

1139
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,320
and he gave us uh he gave us a handful

1140
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,480
of seats

1141
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,920
well it just so happens that we go back

1142
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,358
and we bloom all this [ __ ] that we

1143
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,760
bought and the best thing that we had

1144
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,440
was this weed from maui

1145
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,960
that the dude had given us at a coffee

1146
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,559
shop for free

1147
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,639
and so since we

1148
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,920
didn't know anything about it because

1149
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,719
we're dumb and we didn't ask any

1150
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,320
questions because we were like 19

1151
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,319
or whatever uh

1152
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,880
only thing i know about it is it it the

1153
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,640
dude grew it on maui

1154
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,318
and it is

1155
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,400
a really it's kind of a strange plant

1156
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,519
and that it has super thin

1157
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,000
very thin almost like thai type leaves

1158
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,239
they're double serrated up both sides it

1159
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,239
has like red pedials on the underside of

1160
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,919
everything yeah and

1161
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,919
but it's short it's only like eight

1162
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,480
weeks eight and a half weeks and it

1163
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,119
yields huge chunks

1164
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,679
all over itself top to bottom

1165
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,280
so it but then it had it throws leaves

1166
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,399
all over itself but then the leaves are

1167
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,160
so thin

1168
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,639
unlike a lot of afghanis it doesn't

1169
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:41,920
really choke itself out with over over

1170
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,440
leafage yeah you can like see through it

1171
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,119
if that makes sense

1172
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,000
because all the leaves are like this

1173
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,160
wide you know they're all really skinny

1174
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:56,079
you know and so we um

1175
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:59,279
that uh yeah so csi i gave him that cut

1176
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,560
so that cut is we sprouted that seed in

1177
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,960
the summer of 1994.

1178
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:08,000
so it's going to be 28 years old this

1179
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,000
year jesus christ something like that

1180
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,760
and he also has another maui i think as

1181
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,280
well the maui wowie if i remember

1182
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,280
correctly yeah so yeah so he so that one

1183
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,119
and that maui um

1184
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,200
that maui ended up becoming relatively

1185
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,160
famous because i

1186
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:26,719
uh and probably like o2 or o3ish i gave

1187
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,559
a bunch of seeds to mandelbrot

1188
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,480
of which um

1189
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,039
you know i gave him a bunch of super dog

1190
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,199
by maui by superdog

1191
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,480
and he found this cut called the truth

1192
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,000
in there

1193
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,199
and he ended up breeding a bunch with

1194
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,280
that

1195
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,639
so that maui kind of like percolated

1196
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,560
around

1197
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,000
and it was grown in mendo for years and

1198
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:47,838
years um

1199
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,679
because it it'll it'll give you a four

1200
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,759
to six pound plant that's done october

1201
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,519
15th yeah

1202
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,599
and it's not great resin production it's

1203
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,318
got great resin production it's it's

1204
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,519
it's i wouldn't call it like an absolute

1205
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,440
elite

1206
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,000
you know like i think it's beautiful

1207
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,480
though but it's got it's beautiful it's

1208
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,719
it's got a decent high it's got crazy

1209
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,480
structure crazy yield

1210
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,159
um it's a really it's like one of the

1211
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,920
better plants i've ever crossed things

1212
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,199
to yeah

1213
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,400
so

1214
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,719
um

1215
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,160
so yeah that he's gonna use he he likes

1216
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,078
pairing things

1217
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:23,199
or like looking at different varieties

1218
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,200
and trying to see what he thinks is

1219
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,039
gonna cross well together

1220
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,639
so maybe something to do with uh you

1221
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,159
know northern lights has you know

1222
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,679
potentially some hawaiian in it

1223
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,440
different ones or whatever like he's

1224
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,639
going to cross that to the

1225
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,159
that's going to get ended up getting

1226
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,159
crossed to the maui

1227
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,838
um but he released what was it he

1228
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,239
released the tk by

1229
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,039
maui by tk and maui

1230
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,439
yeah

1231
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:48,318
and and i get pictures all the time it

1232
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,440
really seems like those those uh maui by

1233
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,599
kem or

1234
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,838
the la by chem d

1235
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,680
people find tons of killer [ __ ] in it

1236
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:59,599
yeah so hopefully you know um

1237
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,279
one of the things that's good about csi

1238
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,720
is that he's prolific

1239
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
yeah

1240
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,639
he's very prolific dude so by me sharing

1241
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,280
some cuts with him

1242
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,799
it gives people a chance to try a bunch

1243
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,640
of stuff that they might hear about a

1244
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,800
bunch um you know because he's probably

1245
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,960
the most prolific breeder i know

1246
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,800
um someone was asking the the flower

1247
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,119
time and parents on the banana tie which

1248
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,000
is up for auction right now um

1249
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,800
uh

1250
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,920

1251
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,560
fruit tie

1252
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,639
uh cross two the platinum banana ogb x1

1253
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,078
flowering times right around some some

1254
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,199
people are getting them around nine to

1255
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,519
11 weeks some pull it early um

1256
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,639
it's it's it tends to

1257
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,400
dominate towards the mother cut which is

1258
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:46,559
what i would have liked it to have done

1259
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,720
except that it does have added uh resin

1260
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,440
production and some have that beautiful

1261
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,519
banana with like juicy

1262
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,159
fruit stripes gum for those my age fruit

1263
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,318
stripes gums the best description of

1264
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,118
what that that mother cut smells like

1265
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,960
and right now it's at 220 um

1266

1268
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,440
just

1269
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,199
putting it up and i'll throw in a pack

1270
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,559
of the silver pearl blue bonnet as well

1271
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,559
which is actually perfect pearl blue

1272
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,759
bonnet the silver pearl s1 from our

1273
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,000
buddy pit

1274
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,319
yeah so i'll toss that in too and that's

1275
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,318
a nice cut too dude that cut is

1276
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,480
phenomenal i fell in love with it the

1277
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,800
first second i even saw it let alone

1278
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,760
smoked it once i smoked it it has this

1279
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,960
uh

1280
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,160
it has its own type of bubble gumminess

1281
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,358
which will lead me into something else

1282
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,679
but it has its own type of bubble

1283
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:36,078
gumminess that really was brought out

1284
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,318
with the blue bonnet it has a lot of

1285
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,440
good blueberry bubble gum phenos

1286
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:44,480
and speaking of bubble gum uh me and csi

1287
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,000
have a a a selection inside the nl5 we

1288
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,280
call it the number seven

1289
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,838
and it is

1290
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,040
as he as he puts it and he's a big fan

1291
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,119
of indiana bubblegum it's one of his

1292
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,920
favorite breeders all of it

1293
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,720
it is more pink bubblegum

1294
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,318
louder pink bubblegum than the indiana

1295
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:01,519
bubblegum cut so we're really excited to

1296
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:03,519
bring that one out and we're also

1297
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,239
crossing that specific uh

1298
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,280
cut to bubble gum at some point

1299
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,799
um

1300
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,119
so a couple of things i'll talk about

1301
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,079
silver pearl in a second but

1302
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,240
one of the things that we should

1303
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,560
probably mention that's neat is that one

1304
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:18,239
of the things that's that

1305
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,119
csi does that a lot of other people

1306
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,039
doesn't

1307
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,559
doesn't do at least is that

1308
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,800
he'll you know

1309
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,799
you can do multi-stage

1310
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,119
breeding

1311
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,280
right where what matt was just talking

1312
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,318
about is it's like he popped a bunch of

1313
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,119
stuff he found things that he liked

1314
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:39,199
he made selections and then he's

1315
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,119
crossing those selections to a wide

1316
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,639
variety of other things yeah and so

1317
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,000
there's a lot of breeding right now just

1318
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,838
because the way the market is it's kind

1319
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,239
of like

1320
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,559
one-offs you know so it is neat uh in

1321
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,719
that sea of one-offs that where you can

1322
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,799
do some multi-stage

1323
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,559
where you can pick things select things

1324
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,039
cross those things to other things that

1325
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,519
you like once you figure out what it is

1326
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,719
you know yeah um

1327
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,599
and all that and bubble gum is is a

1328
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:07,199
terp

1329
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,519
in afghani

1330
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,279
yeah you know a neville talked about

1331
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,440
some of the maple leaf stuff smelling

1332
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,160
very strongly of bubble gums yeah the

1333
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,599
original big bud cut had a bubble gum

1334
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,759
like nose

1335
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,240
yeah so it's one of those it's it's one

1336
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,560
of those terps that occasionally pops up

1337
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,559
in afghans yeah you know you'll get

1338
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,639
you'll get a bubblegum nose and what's

1339
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,880
interesting about that is that

1340
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,400
while the indiana bubblegum absolutely

1341
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,960
smells like chewing gum when it's

1342
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,200
growing yeah and when it's drying it

1343
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,760
doesn't really taste the same that it

1344
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,000
smells no that's the the one problem

1345
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,760
that that i found with it is that the

1346
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
taste doesn't translate

1347
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,200
um as well with the bubble it doesn't it

1348
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,719
the smell

1349
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,960
i mean when it's when you know those

1350
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,719
terpenes in the air when it's blooming

1351
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,800
it's straight up smells like bubble gum

1352
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:56,879
yeah and then you smoke it and if you

1353
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,119
got that like big league chew style

1354
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,760
flavor on your on you know in your taste

1355
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,318
buds yeah i would probably be one of the

1356
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,160
highest regarded cuts out there i i you

1357
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,759
know i've had this uh debate going on

1358
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,838
with csi about

1359
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,760
looking through the durbin poison

1360
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:14,078
indiana bubble gum specifically because

1361
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,760
i found out uh in the

1362
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,440
in the 95 centistar line there was a

1363
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,960
bunch of terpenoline and there was one

1364
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,119
pheno that was hardcore pink bubblegum

1365
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,838
with some terpenoline and whereas it

1366
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,960
wasn't as pink bubblegummy loud as the

1367
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:29,279
indiana bubblegum cut the flavor was all

1368
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,440
pink bubblegum so i think in that um

1369
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,599
durbin indiana bubblegum there there is

1370
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,599
likely to be some some bubblegum tasting

1371
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,119
stuff he was he was probably trying to

1372
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,880
push you away from it just because you

1373
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,920
have to you'd have to sift through so

1374
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,599
much terpenoline yeah so find it there'd

1375
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,760
be a lot of terpenoline that you'd have

1376
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,000
to find those those runts

1377
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,680
as it were somebody wanted to talk about

1378
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,239
the silver pearl so i'll talk about that

1379
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,480
before we lose track so our buddy pip

1380
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,838
has a cut of silver pearl

1381
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,800
uh lineage and origin unknown

1382
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:03,519
but i will say it looks very very very

1383
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,880
much like the fino that neville used to

1384
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,880
post at

1385
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,920
the seed bank and

1386
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,680
um

1387
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,240
you know and at scentsy

1388
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:15,679
uh looks very very very similar to that

1389
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,959
exact plant yeah um and it it looks like

1390
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,399
90s weed

1391
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,960
for lack of a better term don't you

1392
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,639
think yeah very classic it's not super

1393
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,639
dense kind of airy yeah yeah um

1394
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,239
it uh you know

1395
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,480
this might be something that like people

1396
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,838
think is off-putting but like

1397
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,440
you know there's a lot of smells and

1398
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:35,440
weed that you wouldn't think are nice in

1399
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,280
other instances but in weed you like

1400
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:42,960
them right um but and uh it kind of

1401
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:45,519
smells to me like really young baby poo

1402
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,519
really oh it does yeah

1403
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,599
it has it has like a baby like a like

1404
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,119
not like when kids start eating food but

1405
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,119
like when they're on like a pure milk

1406
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,480
diet and they're a couple months old

1407
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,480
you know

1408
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,880
it has this like weird baby poo type

1409
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,719
smell to it it doesn't have a bunk to it

1410
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,318
it has a funk to it you know and and

1411
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:04,159
what's interesting about that is like

1412
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:05,838
you might think oh gross you know but

1413
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,759
roadkill is really gross

1414
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:09,199
yeah like there's no you know people are

1415
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,119
like oh i want that there's there's

1416
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,879
stink and weed that that like you

1417
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,838
related to something else in life but

1418
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,838
whatever that is it's gross

1419
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,920
yeah that shoreline recently both indoor

1420
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:22,318
and outdoor and there is some [ __ ]

1421
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,720
gross to that [ __ ] like it's but it's

1422
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,318
good it tastes great yeah so when we

1423
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,239
there's like a different aspect to it

1424
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,480
where like you can describe things that

1425
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,479
might be gross but they're good but yeah

1426
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,559
that he he created this it was called

1427
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,838
perfect pearl wasn't it yeah that was

1428
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,160
the best ones yeah and uh so yeah he had

1429
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:42,799
he had this cut that i i believe it's

1430
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:45,440
from the 90s it just looks tough

1431
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,599
like 90s weed it's probably

1432
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,519
and we're basically lucky in that regard

1433
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,760
because most weed from the 90s most

1434
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:53,920
lines we're lucky if one or even two

1435
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,839
phenoes exist yeah

1436
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,599
at most yeah

1437
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,679
you know i mean that's that's basically

1438
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,079
like how much has survived from just

1439
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,399
like 30 years ago

1440
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,760
which is a crazy thing to say yeah you

1441
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,599
know so every

1442
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,599
every uh

1443
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,680
what are the three gassiest strains

1444
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,280
you've ever come across

1445
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,279
i mean gas

1446
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,960
to me maybe we should talk about that

1447
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,680
for a second to me gas is skunk

1448
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,000
right like it doesn't have to be but i

1449
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,879
feel like like that that straight skunk

1450
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,639
smell and that sour diesel smell and

1451
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,440
that fuel terp

1452
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:33,279
and the gassiness i think those are all

1453
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,519
like variations

1454
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,680
of the same terps but you're gonna

1455
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,960
confuse people that when you say skunk

1456
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,960
do you mean skunk one or

1457
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,640
like skunk one is the most confusing

1458
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,000
name

1459
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,960
yeah because uh you know it but yeah i

1460
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,239
mean it

1461
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,960
it um

1462
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,479
like actual like skunk aroma yeah you

1463
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,318
know which which is like the everybody

1464
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,559
calls it like the lost terp and i think

1465
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:03,039
it exists in all these different forms

1466
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,480
yeah just not in that pure

1467
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,159
roadkill form

1468
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,838
yeah and i i think it's a lot more

1469
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,159
accessible than people realize they just

1470
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:12,400
don't listen

1471
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,480
you know super skunk never left

1472
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,400
like like headband like you look you

1473
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,679
look at diesel style plants which

1474
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,119
there's a lot of

1475
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:21,199
yeah and they're just like like from a

1476
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,519
breeders perspective they're classic

1477
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:26,000
skunkoid type plants

1478
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,759
yep the their bud structure the way they

1479
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,480
grow the way they look kind of mexican

1480
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,640
colombian with some density like they

1481
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,119
they're i mean that to me is like the

1482
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,118
diesel family is like modern skunk but

1483
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,760
keep keep keep

1484
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,838
uh i gotta keep insisting on on

1485
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,760
specifying not skunk one because i know

1486
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:45,519
that's all people are gonna hear and

1487
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,839
think

1488
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:50,159
yeah so we could clarify that too i mean

1489
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,400
i i don't post on ig very much but i

1490
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,000
kind of posted a couple times

1491
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,280
last week because i got all mad about

1492
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,159
something

1493
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:02,400
uh because this this idiot blocked me

1494
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:04,000
for voicing my opinion yeah but uh

1495
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,920
basically like that you can you can

1496
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,719
actually like look for a longer thing on

1497
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,920
my on my uh my my post or whatever but

1498
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,039
basically

1499
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,720
when sam the skunk man got skunk won it

1500
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,880
was super skunky

1501
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,799
according to sam according to sam it

1502
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,720
reeked it didn't matter how you grew it

1503
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,640
who grew it where you grew it what you

1504
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:25,118
fed it what environmental conditions you

1505
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,118
had it in yeah and uh he it was all

1506
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,318
skunky and he didn't like it

1507
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,599
and so he spent from 75 according to him

1508
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:36,480
to the mid-80s doing everything he could

1509
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,119
to get that skunk smell out of skunk one

1510
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,199
yeah because he didn't like the high

1511
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,318
uh nearly and he didn't like the flavor

1512
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,318
yeah so

1513
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:47,679
then he took some

1514
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:49,279
some still slightly skunky skunk one to

1515
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:52,159
amsterdam

1516
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,800
and kept breeding it to sweet citrus

1517
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,759
floral everything yeah

1518
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,160
so

1519
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,880
for the last 30 years

1520
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:03,199
every four or five years uh people come

1521
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,079
up and they say i've got this old rare

1522
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:08,239

1524
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:13,118
what you want in that skunk one yeah

1525
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,519

1526
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,680
saying oh it's sam skunk one that uh you

1527

the flying dutchman yeah i got it from a

1530
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,039
million places because everyone sells

1531
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,800

this day yeah

1535
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,880
just because a bunch of americans aren't

1536
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,280
growing it doesn't mean it's the most

1537
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,039
common thing out there yeah and they

1538
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,079
crossed it to everything in the 90s

1539
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:44,558
everything was some female by skunk one

1540
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,160
yes it was the most common thing and

1541
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,400
that skunk one

1542
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:50,719
produces citrus

1543
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,559

1548
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:10,400

1549
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:12,639
doing his damnedest to make sure it

1550
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,400

1551
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:15,358

1557
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:29,039
you know like for instance uh when um

1558
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,519

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,240
right where it's like we should maybe

1587
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,239
we don't have to talk about the whole

1588
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:31,679
thing yeah but

1589
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:35,039
but we can talk about something pretty

1590
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:36,239
basic is that you know uh duke came out

1591
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:39,279
with this

1592
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:42,318
ancient virginia skunk from the mountain

1593
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,240

1595
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:50,558
these guys bred skunk for sssc they were

1596
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,798
the american breeders for sssc

1597
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,599
all this and that you know and that he

1598
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:56,719
inherited these these beans from his

1599
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,559
uncle

1600
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,480
and this is what he started you know

1601
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,519
dominion seeds and crossing everything

1602
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,199

matt and i got the opportunity which i

1604

1618
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:40,719

1619
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:43,199

1654
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,118
four or five years before sam even

1655
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,039

making hybrids and homegrown and

1662
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:19,919
bricking it up and mailing it across the

1663
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,839
ocean

1664
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,680
so everyone tries to come out with these

1665
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:24,719
ancient

1666
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:26,639

1673
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,440
anybody i'm just trying to i'm just

1674
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,440
trying to like straight say

1675
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:45,440
that all these different people say they

1676
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,760
have rare unusual secret skunk one

1677
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,599
it's all the same skunk one it's all

1678
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,680
citrus

1679
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,720
you know cheese

1680
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:54,318
floral

1681
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:56,798
grape

1682
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,880
you know people breed with it because it

1683
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:01,280
improves bud structure and it improves

1684
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,119
calyx the leaf ratio yeah it makes

1685
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,160
plants look decent it's decent

1686
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,400
especially if you haven't ever

1687
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:08,239
experienced skunk one i'm sure i'm sure

1688
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,079
it's unique and decent and that's why

1689
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:11,919
it's in so many lines today it was a

1690
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,400
revelation because when sam brought it

1691
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,440
to europe it was it bred true for any

1692
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,119
number of

1693
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,039
different traits and you could get four

1694
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,798
or five pounds off it in a greenhouse

1695
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:23,039
yep and they were dealing with all these

1696
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:25,039
weird sativas and all these things that

1697
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,358
didn't want to finish in their area and

1698
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:29,039
it was northern europe and shitty

1699
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:31,279
and he brought skunk one there and it

1700
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:33,599
literally was a revolution

1701
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,798
but people acting like

1702
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:39,039
skunk one is there some secret skunk one

1703
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:42,079
everyone using skunk one is using the

1704
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:44,480
absolute most common

1705
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,798
oldest breeding technique in the book

1706
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,880
yep which is consumers like buds that

1707
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,519
have nice blood structure and nice calyx

1708
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,920
to leaf ratio skunk one does this

1709
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,920
i'm gonna take a male skunk at one and

1710
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,760
i'm gonna cross it to everything

1711
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,599
yeah and then i gotta concoct some rare

1712
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,040
special stories so people don't see it

1713
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,680
as the same [ __ ] that everyone else has

1714
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,920
been doing for forever yeah

1715
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,000
and that's the seed business folks

1716
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,200
that's how it runs

1717
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,960
yeah i mean that's that's the seed

1718
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,358
business and so you got to add floral

1719
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,920
language to it and so right now todd

1720
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:18,078
is trying to make it seem like

1721
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,119
the same skunk one that's been available

1722
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,119
from

1723
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,920
sam to everyone

1724
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,440
is some rare and unusual and secret

1725
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,440
skunk that's been released from the 80s

1726
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,519
it's all the same stuff yeah it's all

1727
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,280
from the same dude and it's probably the

1728
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,759
same [ __ ] that's in your cookies that's

1729
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,200
in ensure that's in all of it it's been

1730
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,559
from the same dude forever and if it's

1731
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,078
not from the same dude it's because

1732
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,519
somebody bought a bunch of that dude's

1733
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:45,920
stuff and bread it themselves

1734
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:47,679
and just to make more seed

1735
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,000
but they didn't do anything specific to

1736
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,798
it it's all it's all skunk one yeah you

1737
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,280
know

1738
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:55,599
and so one thing we do know about skunk

1739
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,359
one right is that there's all kinds of

1740
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,039
people we know that have ran large

1741
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,519
amounts of skunk one

1742
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:04,318
yeah hunting for skunk terps

1743
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,679
and they just don't exist yeah

1744
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:06,558
not happening

1745
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:08,318
it

1746
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,079
there's there is some stuff that there

1747
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,159
was there were some things in the 80s

1748
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,318
that people got that they crossed and

1749
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:17,118
even in the 80s they never got skunk one

1750
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,798
to be skunky yeah they had to cross it

1751
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,280
to something else together it was

1752
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:23,358
popping yeah that was it was also skunky

1753
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,839
to get that skunk turk to pop

1754
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:28,798
like neville took skunk one and threw it

1755
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:30,078
on maple leaf and he got super skunk

1756
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:32,559
you know there was a few different

1757
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:35,359
things in the 90s but now it's like

1758
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:37,519
people are just it's like the same

1759
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,798
you know i don't it's like fashion or

1760
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:40,798
whatever right it's like the same

1761
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:42,239
regurgitated [ __ ] and it's like oh

1762
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:44,159
there's a new generation that doesn't

1763
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,399
know let's resell them the exact same

1764
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,960
thing but let's butter it up

1765
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,200
what's cool though is that now with so

1766
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,039
many more people making seeds so many

1767
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:55,199
more people able to grow

1768
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,759
instead of it being like a cycle of

1769
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,519
every ten five years now it's like every

1770
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,119
two years every one year every six

1771
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:02,719
months oh yeah and there was that and

1772
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,000
there was that guy what was this i

1773
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,838
didn't want to say his name was blue or

1774
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,358
scott there's yeah

1775
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,679
there's there's other people out there

1776
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:12,000
that that sell uh you know there's

1777
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:14,000
another guy that that had uncle fester

1778
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,400
skunk everyone all these

1779
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,480
all these rare skunks

1780
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,880
right all this you know you're right

1781
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,760
skunk one is that but i've got this one

1782
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,079
hook

1783
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,119
that gave me this ancient rare skunk one

1784
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:29,039
but from before it went fruity yeah and

1785
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,559
i'm gonna sell it to you now before it

1786
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,920
went to amsterdam

1787
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,599
you know yeah

1788
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,440
and so it's it's

1789
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,880
so the the sulfur someone's asking about

1790
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,920
the sulfur talk

1791
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,318
uh

1792
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,760
uh todd mccormick made this post that

1793
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:44,000
maybe people

1794
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,359
uh weren't getting skunky smells anymore

1795
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,119
because they weren't using sulfur

1796
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:48,960
burners as much yeah because people

1797
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,798
don't use sulfur burners anymore i i

1798
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,559
kind of took it i kind of took it as

1799
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:55,679
like a bunch of people were buying his

1800
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:57,359
skunk and not finding any skunk

1801
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:58,960
and getting upset about it because it's

1802
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,798
not in skunk one

1803
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,960
and so he's trying to ruminate on what

1804
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:04,880
could be the difference

1805
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,639

1806

you name it yeah he has been spouting

1815
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:27,679
his version of events

1816
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,639
for like 30 years yes he's been writing

1817
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,279
it down

1818
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,440
it's no secret you can have the dude

1819
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,440
himself will sit there and lay out

1820
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,838
exactly what he did and why and why you

1821
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,480
won't find what you're looking for

1822
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:42,000
you know yeah but people want to make it

1823
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,199
people want to make it seem like that's

1824
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,960
and that's what's kind of coming right

1825
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,439
now is everyone was like

1826
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,480
5 10 15 years ago i saw a buddy joke

1827
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,639
that like

1828
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,199
uh you couldn't give away gypsy nirvana

1829
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:54,960
skunk one seeds 15 years ago yeah no he

1830
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:56,239
couldn't i couldn't give him away

1831
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,519
because people knew what they were and

1832
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:58,798
they were like no i don't really want

1833
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:00,559
that yeah

1834
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,639
you know so

1835
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:04,319
i mean that's but but that's what that's

1836
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,239
what's happening is now

1837
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:07,599
you know you can you can segue to it or

1838
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:10,000
whatever and it's the same thing with

1839
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:12,880
sour it's the same like all these old

1840
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,400
things that have name recognition

1841
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,680
but a lot of people on a personal

1842
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,599
experience with them are gonna

1843
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:20,159
repackaged

1844
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,640
and unscrupulous people are gonna like

1845
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,759
you know sell you hopes and dreams

1846
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:25,598
you know

1847
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,440
yeah that's how it goes

1848
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,880
and and that's that's a big part of it

1849
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,880
is is

1850
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,640
they're relying on people not to have

1851
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,640
had experience with it in the first

1852
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:37,118
place and and they're relying on all

1853
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,078
this knowing that it's very likely a lot

1854
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,358
of people aren't gonna have that

1855
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,720
experience with it so how the [ __ ] are

1856
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:42,400
you going to tell them it's not that and

1857
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,919
that's that's

1858
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,079
never stopped existing in the sea world

1859
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,119
no i don't think so i mean

1860
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,960
they uh

1861
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,480
you know and and just just so people

1862
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,838
know it's like i see people saying we

1863
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,960
should talk about that too running

1864
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:58,000
todd's purist indica and nl5

1865
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,480
um

1866
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,039
you know we uh

1867
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,240
i shouldn't say we uh matt did an

1868
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,960
interview

1869
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:09,358
uh with uh with the guy basically the

1870
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,880
head guy that kind of

1871
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:12,558
created nl

1872
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,160
and his group of friends and his group

1873
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,839
of friends and his little group of

1874
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,159
growers or whatever kind of is the

1875
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:20,719
reason why nl is so famous

1876
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:23,038
and they sent uh neville and scentsy a

1877
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,159
bunch of seed and the rest is kind of

1878
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,520
history

1879
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:26,798
and after

1880
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:28,239
um

1881
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,480
i believe it was after he did that

1882
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:33,919
interview yeah with you

1883
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,400
he found some seed and he sent some seed

1884
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,960
to you right matt directly yeah and then

1885
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,838
he also sent some seed to todd yes at

1886
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,039
the same time at the same time and so

1887
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:45,838
um

1888
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,240
you know it's not todd's anything

1889
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,480
todd got it sent to him from

1890
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:53,038
you know got it sent to him from greg

1891
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,039
you know and the stuff that that uh csi

1892
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,640
and and matt and you know this the kind

1893
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,359
of little collab thing that's been going

1894
01:05:56,639 --> 01:05:59,440
on

1895
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,719
um that's all the same seed stock that

1896
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,119
todd got

1897
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,118
um but we we got it from the same we got

1898
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:07,519
it from the same person yeah and i we

1899
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,798
know the main thing was that like

1900
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:10,880
there it seemed like there was going to

1901
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,400
be a race to pop them to get them out

1902
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,838
there and i didn't want to do that i

1903
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,318
wanted to make sure that they could all

1904
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,759
be popped at at one time because why i

1905
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:20,239
just looked through

1906
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,920
four or five in your closet and then do

1907
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:24,798
a repro from that when you can do you

1908
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,240
know 80 of them so we we decided to wait

1909
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:27,838
until it was uh

1910
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:31,038
it was time until we had the space to do

1911
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:34,239
it luckily csi humble provided that and

1912
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,799
and luckily we we've pulled it off and

1913
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,399
really started and csi you know he's

1914
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,239
really experienced he's got a really

1915
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,400
good numbering system he's got a really

1916
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:45,519
good note-taking system he's got a

1917
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,200
really good way of identifying you know

1918
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:49,119
different traits and different things

1919
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:50,879
that might be of interest

1920
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,480
and um

1921
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,000
you know yeah the someone just talked

1922
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,440
about could you talk about the gypsy

1923
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,159
nirvana era

1924
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,599
uh that whole that that whole movie and

1925
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:02,159
just that whole era that's probably a

1926
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,240
whole show in itself yeah that yeah yeah

1927
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:06,000
that's a wild show yeah that's a that's

1928
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:07,519
a wild show but even his era and

1929
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,920
everything that was going on then i mean

1930
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,838
we could talk for it that's a

1931
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,280
there's a lot going on then yeah we

1932
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:15,038
could bring chimera on for something

1933
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,720
like that because he was you know

1934
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,720
involved heavily into that stuff at that

1935
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,318
time that'd be a good one somebody said

1936
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:21,959
the only time i ever got a sandalwood

1937
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:25,519
smell was there was this

1938
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:28,159
ak-47 that was sent around the colorado

1939
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:30,960
area and the 90s yeah and it smelled

1940
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:33,358
extremely strong of sandalwood uh our

1941
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,240
buddy crybaby could probably pop in and

1942
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:38,000
and tell us what terpenes that is uh i'm

1943
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:39,679
i'm old and i don't i don't have

1944
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,599

1947
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:48,000
memorized i know that terpenoline smells

1948
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,160
like jack and and

1949
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,719
and witch hazel train and train wreck

1950
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:56,639
and stuff like that you know so

1951
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:59,919
um what people are saying nl so

1952
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:02,159
nl is like nl is super famous because

1953
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,400
neville and scentsy you know but

1954
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:06,318
basically neville made it so he took

1955
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:08,798
seattle greg seeds

1956
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,798
and grew up a bunch of them and released

1957
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:14,318
multiple lines and then a whole bunch of

1958
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:17,920
hybrids yes right and so

1959
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:20,158
he released nl1 and nl2 pure

1960
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:23,359
and then he found one female that was

1961
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:26,559
like a throwback plant of nl5

1962
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:29,440
and that nl5 mother cut if you will

1963
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,520
uh he used extensively he crossed it to

1964
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,599
hayes he crossed it to skunk one he

1965
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,920
crossed it to nl2

1966
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,480
uh it was in the poly a lot of the

1967
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:41,279
polyhybrids he sold it was in there yeah

1968
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,119
so it kind of bubbled up and got

1969
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,480
super famous

1970
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:49,278
uh steve murphy was involved with nl in

1971
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:50,000
the sense that his afghani seeds given

1972
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,799
to

1973
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,079
greg is the beginning of nlp and the uh

1974
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,600
story behind that was um a lady that

1975
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:59,759
steve murphy knew

1976
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,520
went through the hippie hash trail

1977
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,439
through the mountains of pakistan and

1978
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,040
afghanistan and collected seeds and they

1979
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,358
don't really know if it's an afghani or

1980
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:08,719
a [ __ ] to be sure but she's the one who

1981
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,400
brought them back for steve murphy and

1982
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,560
he gave some of those seeds out and they

1983
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:15,838
made their way into the nl the base for

1984
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,359
nl the base for nl and so

1985
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,119
yeah i mean

1986
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,440
and then those guys all got busted in

1987
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:22,399
the late 80s

1988
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,479
and

1989
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,759
uh greg basically said if he hadn't sent

1990
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:27,919
them to europe it probably all would

1991
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,880
have been lost yeah

1992
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,279
and

1993
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,079
you know uh neville neville was one of

1994
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,839
the only only only breeders selling

1995
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,559
seeds back then so the stuff that he was

1996
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:40,238
selling became immensely popular

1997
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,759
i think you know and then there was

1998
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:44,959
other people was it dutch passion that

1999
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,319
sold nl2 was oasis yes yes that was a

2000
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,600
dead so there was other there was you

2001
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,080
know there was there was other people

2002
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:52,159
that that got neville's seeds or scentsy

2003
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:53,920
seeds and white labeled them or made

2004
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,759
their own crosses

2005
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,520
um and then so

2006
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,960
one thing that we should say is skunk

2007
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,800
one and and nl and all that is in almost

2008
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,279
everything

2009
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,480
it's in a lot of today's work

2010
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:08,479
it's just

2011
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:09,599
generations past

2012
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:12,079
yeah

2013
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,800
you know so i mean that's kind of how i

2014
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:17,600
see it it's like yeah nl skunk and hazer

2015
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,520
and so much so much and so it's like you

2016
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,440
might not you might people younger

2017
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,199
people today might not have like much

2018
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,639
access to them pure

2019
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:25,599
yeah right

2020
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,960
but they

2021
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,199
i mean their grandchildren and

2022
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,760
great-grandchildren and poly hybrids

2023
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:34,079
from them are all over the place oh yeah

2024
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,960
their fingerprints are everywhere

2025
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,559
and uh that's partially america's fault

2026
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,319
because we give [ __ ] nicknames to

2027
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,000
everything

2028
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,759
yeah it really is we do we give

2029
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,359
nicknames to everything so you start

2030
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,000
giving nicknames to thing in your crew

2031
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,599
and then only the nickname becomes known

2032
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,399
and then you don't know what seeds it

2033
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,440
was

2034
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:55,920
yeah you don't know what it came from

2035
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:58,319
you know i mean so it's like you can we

2036
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,359
could somebody asked about the dog [ __ ]

2037
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:03,279
the dog [ __ ] was was called uh the dog

2038
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:05,119
[ __ ] got named that an organ

2039
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:06,960
in minnesota where it was popped it was

2040
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,439
called electric bugaloo

2041
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,239
such a bad name such a better name way

2042
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:14,319
cooler name and it's also very very very

2043
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:16,479
likely that it's an nl5 haze from the

2044
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:18,319
early 90s

2045
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:20,559
but you buy some nl5 haze from the early

2046
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:21,920
90s and you pop a seed and you like it

2047
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,000
and it gives you a great buzz and you

2048
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,440
call it electric boogaloo

2049
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,920
and then you send it out to oregon and

2050
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,839
some idiot calls it dog [ __ ]

2051
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,158
and then now it's a dog [ __ ]

2052
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,400
someone k uh arizona regenerative keeps

2053
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:36,000
asking about granite daddy perp so the

2054
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:39,119
basic story of granddaddy purp is that

2055
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,600
it's an urkel uh hybrid or rename

2056
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:44,319
whether it came from ken or whoever else

2057
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,800
um the the surviving cuts all are based

2058
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:49,359
on purple and most people that have both

2059
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,320
cuts chose to go with the original which

2060
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:54,559
was urkel um yeah that's that's just a

2061
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,000
rough run down on it that's it and

2062
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,520
there's there's something i mean there's

2063
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,039
a lot more i could add to that one but

2064
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,000
one of the things that is interesting

2065
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:05,119
about it

2066
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
is that for as popular as urkel became

2067
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,198
there's

2068
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,119
i mean there's people out there that

2069
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:11,039
want to claim the mantle

2070
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:13,439
but there really still isn't a

2071
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:16,399
verifiable believable

2072
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:18,559
urkel origin story no there isn't and

2073
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,079
it's one of the few cuts that got that

2074
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,679
famous

2075
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:24,238
that

2076
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:27,520
like the the story or you know

2077
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:29,359
information hasn't hasn't popped up

2078
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,040
you know it really is still a mystery

2079
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:33,359
and there's been people like csi and

2080
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:35,679
myself and others who have literally

2081
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:37,519
been hunting for what it is for 20 plus

2082
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,760
years yeah

2083
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,800
there's a lot of claimants but none of

2084
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,520
them

2085
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:46,159
hold any gas it hasn't seemed to hold it

2086
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,600
hasn't seemed to hold any water yeah um

2087
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,679
and so that that

2088
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,000
when you know when uh

2089
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,600
when when urkel came out and became

2090
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,439
super famous

2091
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,960
that was like the what i call the purple

2092
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:59,119
craze

2093
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,560
right and so that urkel granddaddy

2094
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:04,719
purple grape ape purple dragon

2095
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,880
um all that all that different type of

2096
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,800
stuff my mendo perps all that stuff

2097
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,600
became super famous

2098
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,840
and some of those names i'm sure renames

2099
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,840
some of them are bag seeds

2100
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,079
yes that's how it goes

2101
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,960
um you know some of them are just well

2102
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,760
you know

2103
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,520
if i call it grape ape i can claim it

2104
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,840
as my crews

2105
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,520
and i can take it down to you know and

2106
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,679
back then it was like all that weed was

2107
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:32,159
going through a lot of the dispensaries

2108
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:34,239
in the bay area just limitless amounts

2109
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:37,359
yeah and so uh trap mouth glass pointed

2110
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:40,158
out there's skunk in s1 progeny of urkel

2111
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,399
and yeah uh yeah even even if you have

2112
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:45,039
the clone or some of the the hybrids or

2113
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,759
swans in veg if you take cuts of it it

2114
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:49,439
smells like skunk spray everywhere um it

2115
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,880
doesn't pop up very regularly but it's

2116
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:52,399
definitely in there

2117
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,079
and you know i mean at the time that it

2118
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:55,920
was found i mean it kind of it kind of

2119
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:58,479
kind of started spreading a lot in the

2120
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,399
early 2000s yeah that's right on the

2121
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:02,000
tail end of all that

2122
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,599
skunk and everything skunk one and

2123
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,238
everything yeah but it wouldn't be

2124
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,840
surprising at all that it would have

2125
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:10,479
you know whether it's a poly hybrid or

2126
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,480
whether it's a skunk one or a skunk one

2127
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,759
hybrid that got mixed to something local

2128
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,279
up here

2129
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,960
but it's one of the few strains that got

2130
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:20,639
that famous that like there really

2131
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:23,279
hasn't been a verifiable

2132
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,800
story i think the only thing accurate

2133
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:27,119
that i've ever heard about it that

2134
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,679
sounds accurate at least

2135
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,679
is that it's packy skunk one or afghani

2136
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:34,000
skunk one i could i could totally see it

2137
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,600
you know yeah but um that that's that's

2138
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,238
trailed along with it all throughout its

2139
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,000
little life uh and what people say so

2140
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:42,158
it's just interesting that we got that

2141
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
much there's a lot of stuff we could we

2142
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:47,519
could go into uh

2143
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,399
into uh well thought out hypotheticals

2144
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,840
yeah that's a deep one yeah

2145
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:53,599
you know there's a difference between i

2146
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,319
try to like i try when i talk to people

2147
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,800
to like differentiate when i'm i think

2148
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:01,198
i'm talking in like actual fact

2149
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:03,600
yeah and when you're venturing into like

2150
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:05,599
educated guesses or what the plants told

2151
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,000
you or you're stringing together a story

2152
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,400
from bits and pieces that you know

2153
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
you know yeah

2154
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:14,319
so

2155
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,840
you know um

2156
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:18,079
i mean definitely yeah i mean the guy

2157
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,440
said there's definitely afghan like

2158
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:20,559
it definitely doesn't have very much

2159
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:23,359
stretch

2160
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,400
yeah no uh urkel was always one of those

2161
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:26,319
ones where

2162
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:28,799
you get it to about the size you want it

2163
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:29,679
to be and then you flip it

2164
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,679
yeah

2165
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,840
it's it's not gonna it's not gonna grow

2166
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,079
all that much one of my favorite urkel

2167
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,319
hybrids has always been the um

2168
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:40,640
the urkel trey dog that high lonesome

2169
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:42,880
did there was so much skunkiness in that

2170
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:45,760
[ __ ] line he killed it

2171
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,039
he uh uh csi has one

2172
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,000
i mean

2173
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:52,399
uh tk by urkel yeah yeah and that's what

2174
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,960
that t-1000 came from or whatever you

2175
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:57,198
know yeah and that stuff added a little

2176
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,119
bit of potency and a you know a little

2177
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:02,000
different a little different kick to it

2178
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:03,359
i liked that one quite a bit you know

2179
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,719
so

2180
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,839
i mean

2181
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,119
but yeah i mean it a lot what irritates

2182
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,279
me is that

2183
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:13,198
there's a lot of like

2184
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:15,039
i don't even know how to put it but

2185
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,519
the weed game seems like it reinvents

2186
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:20,399
itself every five or ten years yeah

2187
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:22,159
right and so as a result of that you

2188
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,238
keep getting this is what makes matt so

2189
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:28,079
mad is you keep getting people

2190
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:30,000
coming out with the same tired scams

2191
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:32,479
but ready for a new batch of people that

2192
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,198
haven't heard them yet yeah and the same

2193
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:36,718
[ __ ] stories and there's some people

2194
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:38,479
i mean there was there was some [ __ ]

2195
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:41,679

spewing spewing bull on various on

2199
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:51,519
various aspects of things and so

2200
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,520
i just want to say my favorite was when

2201
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,760
he pretended to be an old lady who was

2202
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,239
married to a man who just passed that

2203
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:01,280
carried the asian fantasy that was my

2204
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:04,959
favorite yeah my favorite nyc kid won

2205
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:07,279
and so yeah you know rascal uh

2206
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,520
there's an era there from like like that

2207
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:11,679
was more matt's era than mine because i

2208
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,080
was having kids and wrapped up and and

2209
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:17,359
living in the hills then but rascal in

2210
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:21,279
0809 10 11 like he put out a bunch of

2211
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:23,359
fire yeah he cried rascal i you know

2212
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,599
it's a shame he still doesn't too much

2213
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:28,079
but he had a three or four or five year

2214
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:31,280
period there where everything he was

2215
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:32,960
releasing was good yeah and he was one

2216
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,039
of the he was one of the first people

2217
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,520
along with matt and a few others who was

2218
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:39,439
actually successfully reversing things

2219
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,320
yeah so he i don't know if he gets

2220
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:44,559
enough credit no he predated me too so

2221
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:47,759
but he was he wasn't he was an early

2222
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:51,120
wave of revolutionizing how we breed

2223
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:53,679
yeah and people found a lot of fire

2224
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:55,039
in a lot of his lines from back then

2225
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,800
manic you still got you still got some

2226
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,960
rascal gear

2227
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,960
hook it up

2228
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,039
yeah i mean matt matt and i actually it

2229
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,039
was probably six or seven months ago we

2230
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:06,000
were looking through uh

2231
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:08,319
um

2232
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,880
we were looking through a seed list of a

2233
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:14,079
friend of mine who was getting rid of

2234
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:16,000
his seed freezer right yeah and it was

2235
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:19,198
basically all from

2236
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,439
say 07 to 2012.

2237
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:22,799
yeah yeah roughly yeah it was roughly

2238
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,639
all right in that range and it was

2239
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,440
amazing

2240
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:29,520
how little of any of those things you

2241
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:31,519
could still buy today from anyone oh

2242
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,360
yeah most of that's gone most of that

2243
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,960
was and that's only 10 years 10 12 years

2244
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:36,639
ago

2245
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,079
and then you go back another five or ten

2246
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,560
years and that stuff's gone and you go

2247
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,079
back in the 90s and that shit's gone

2248
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,800
yep

2249
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:46,640
you know and so yeah rascal i give him a

2250
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,039
bunch of credit

2251
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,039
um because you know he bred a bunch of

2252
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:54,399
fire yep and he was one of the first

2253
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:57,119
people to kind of start the new

2254
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:59,279
asian fantasy is some [ __ ] that jason

2255
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:00,800
king put in his can of bible and he said

2256
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,519
it was one of the best strains he'd ever

2257
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,159
smoked and it was a crazy sativa

2258
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,480
and i think that can of bible entry and

2259
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:11,439
how highly he talked about it

2260
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,399
created a massive demand for it

2261
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:14,799
and then

2262
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:18,399
it was it was unique looking and that

2263
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:20,800
created and a forum and internet scam

2264
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:23,759
opportunity sure did

2265
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:26,239
same with hp 13 and everything else yeah

2266
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,719
and so you know that kind of thing like

2267
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:30,079
in back before ig and all that like the

2268
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:32,239
forums

2269
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:34,840
um you know that was that was where you

2270
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:38,079
scammed people over the internet

2271
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:40,079
yeah you know and uh

2272
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:42,079
so there was a lot of asian fantasy

2273
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,840
rumors asian fantasy is almost one of

2274
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,158
those weird things where everybody that

2275
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,840
talks about it nobody's really smoked it

2276
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:49,839
the only person i know who's actually

2277
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:52,400
smoked asian fantasy and knows the one

2278
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,520
guy who's kept it and is going to die

2279
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:55,519
with it

2280
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,400
is bodhi and he knows

2281
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:00,560
and apparently obviously jason king

2282
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:03,198
smoked it and loved it enough to write

2283
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,120
like super eloquent you know

2284
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:06,879
write-ups about how amazing it was but

2285
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:09,198
then that dude wouldn't share it either

2286
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,520
no you know so

2287
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:13,119
um yeah and and that's really what it is

2288
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,400
it's like every five or ten years

2289
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:16,238

just

2319
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,439
couldn't give less of a [ __ ] that it

2320
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,560
doesn't align with history and that a

2321
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:22,960
lot of people are going to know he's a

2322
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,360
liar he's going to know that most people

won't be able to encounter that that guy

2324
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:28,639
said it straight up and he was totally

2325
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:32,000
accurate in what he said he didn't give

01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:34,960
a [ __ ] yeah because his his seed

um you know

2336
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,519

real people

2356
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,960

from the original the original lines

2387

from the original breeders

it's like unchanged kept by the right

2390
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,880
guys from the 80s and nothing ever

2391
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,760
happened to it yeah and it's not the

2392
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,679
case

2393
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:54,000

yeah yeah i mean

2395
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,119
i my biggest problem when we first

2396
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:00,719
butted heads was the whole prop 64 thing

2397
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:03,198
which

2398
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:05,198
leads to where we're at now yeah

2399
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:07,919
if we're dying our whole community's

2400
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:10,079
dying and and a lot of that can be

2401
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,079
pointed back to prop 64 which todd was a

2402
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,920
big proponent of because he had a lot of

2403
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:15,279
rich friends and he wanted to push that

2404
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,840
through

2405
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:20,238
yeah i mean todd can todd can uh todd

2406
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,719
can talk about what a uh

2407
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:24,319
you know a weed warrior he's been and

2408
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:25,840

01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:28,559
who's been jailed

2410
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:30,560

this that everything else it's all

2452
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:53,360
pretty well documented right yep and

2453
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:55,359
who knows how much or little todd has

2454
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:58,719
done yeah

2455
01:25:55,359 --> 01:26:01,359
you know you can you can see how big

2456
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,480
uh csi did it yeah

2457
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:04,238
you know you could see that he was

2458
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:06,079
blowing off whole rooms

2459
01:26:04,238 --> 01:26:07,519
yeah and he's made selections and he's

2460
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,439
done all this different stuff and it's

2461
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,960
you know we have a we have a mutual

2462
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:12,719
buddy that's pictures

2463
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,480
pictures or it doesn't count

2464
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,719
yep you know which i don't think is too

2465
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:19,919
true when you go back far enough because

2466
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:22,399
it was risky then but for now jesus

2467
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:25,600
yeah we're actually doing a run

2468
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:27,119
of the clones of the seed moms even

2469
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,880
though we've already pollinated all we

2470
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:32,719
kept clones of every single male and

2471
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,319
female to see how they flower as clones

2472
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,239
so we know that you know if we're saying

2473
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:38,158
this one's gonna be bubble gummy from

2474
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:39,759
this specific one we'll know that it's

2475
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:42,319
actually bubblegummy as a clone and can

2476
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,840
pass onset traits so yeah there's a lot

2477
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:45,920
more involved that people have no clue

2478
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,360
about yet yeah i don't think anybody is

2479
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:52,158
going to recreate nl5 haze

2480
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:54,079
um i mean it would be nice we're doing

2481
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:56,399
some interesting stuff but it would be

2482
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:58,000
nice straight in all five haze because i

2483
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:00,079
don't think any of us are rocking just

2484
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,880
straight original haze because it would

2485
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:04,719
take a big pop of old original haze in

2486
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,159
the first place to find a pheno worth

2487
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:09,359
breeding with and then you gotta hope

2488
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:11,679
that it passes on any of the traits um

2489
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:15,039
but we are doing some crosses with the

2490
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:17,679
nl5 stuff that will be similar to to a

2491
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:19,439
nl5 across the nl5a something like that

2492
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:21,520
and then i wasn't even trying i wasn't

2493
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,759
even trying to diss it because basically

2494
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:26,320
what you're saying is is cross a an

2495
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,760
extreme sativa to an indica yeah and

2496
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:29,439
hopefully find something i just

2497
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,840
personally think that

2498
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:35,039
nl5 hayes is probably the single most

2499
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,520
successful release seed line in history

2500
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,840
yeah mr toad has an original it don't

2501
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,440
even start me on mr toad

2502
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,600
so i mean here here's the thing about

2503
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:45,198
original haze is that original haze is

2504
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,679
also not rare

2505
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:49,678
it's also easily available it all comes

2506
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,600
from the same dude just like skunk one

2507
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:52,399
it comes from sam skunk man

2508
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,800
right

2509
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:57,039
and he has sold kilos of that you used

2510
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,440
to be able to buy

2511
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:02,560
pure haze f10

2512
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:04,079
in the 90s from the flying dutchman

2513
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,560
and they'd have big write-ups on it you

2514
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:08,479
could get pure haze from seeds men

2515
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,080
you could get pure haze from all over

2516
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:11,919
the place yeah

2517
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:14,319
um it's not rare

2518
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,158
it's not hard to find

2519
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:19,119
what is hard to find is it does seem

2520
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:21,759
that the haze seeds that neville got and

2521
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:22,960
positronics got and

2522
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,400
uh

2523
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:29,198
sssc got in the mid 80s

2524
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:31,359
they found phenos that were much easier

2525
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:34,319
to create quality with

2526
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:36,079
than after sam had done multiple ops

2527
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:36,960
open pollinations

2528
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:39,198
so

2529
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,520
there's uh you know you could like you

2530
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:43,198
i'm not what matt is basically saying is

2531
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,280
that the amount of work it would it

2532
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:47,678
would take to find the type of haze

2533
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:50,479
that's that neville found

2534
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:52,560
yes is really hard yeah

2535
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:54,399
because open pollination is a great

2536
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,400
thing but it really opens it up which

2537
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:58,000
means you have to hunt through

2538
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:00,238
so much more

2539
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,600
i do know that scabby and white buffalo

2540
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:04,319
have some really good hazes they've been

2541
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:06,079
showing off and uh crossing so i think

2542
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:07,679
that maybe maybe that'll be a cool

2543
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:09,760
project use one of their their hay

2544
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:11,840
selections across with the nlp that

2545
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:14,960
that's a definite possibility tom tom

2546
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:17,920
hills hayes is from positronic stock and

2547
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:20,239
we are uh bidding on the the banana tie

2548
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,239
f1 and the silver berries right now

2549
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:24,638
somebody said what is super skunk super

2550
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:26,399
skunk was a very skunky

2551
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:28,880
skunk one male

2552
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:32,158
that neville crossed to maple leaf

2553
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:34,880
indica a fino he called afghan tea

2554
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,158
and it became probably the best selling

2555
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,960
thing at

2556
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:41,679
his company and then later at scentsy

2557
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:43,840
and it was the line that popped all the

2558
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,279
skunk terps that everybody dreams about

2559
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,880
yeah

2560
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:49,198
for lack of a better way to put it is

2561
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,199
there is there a neville's haze

2562
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,039
selection neville selection of neville's

2563
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:55,119
haze in the u.s

2564
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:57,840
uh some people have it i'm sure not the

2565
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:59,198
one that i want yeah i will tell people

2566
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,719
if they want to talk about neville's

2567
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:03,519
haze for a second

2568
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:06,158
is that there is a neville's haze fino

2569
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,639
um that still floats around europe that

2570
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:10,238
is by far the strongest sativa i have

2571
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,960
ever encountered

2572
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:15,439
um it neville's haze especially the

2573
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,760
older neville's haze has

2574
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:20,719
like some effects in it that i that are

2575
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:23,760
super uncommon in cannabis yeah uh it's

2576
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:26,480
incredibly potent um i hunted for mine

2577
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,199
myself i think uh we have a buddy of

2578
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:32,079
ours on her direwolf is on here he got

2579
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:33,279
some some uh neville's haze in the late

2580
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:34,719
90s

2581
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:37,679
and he made bubble hash or something

2582
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:40,079
like that that like lasted him 10 years

2583
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:42,639
this stuff is wicked potent yeah it's

2584
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,960
it's anxiety inducing it's

2585
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,480
yeah this the fort collins cough is that

2586
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:49,119
somebody in the room

2587
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:50,319
yeah the cough is i used to grow the

2588
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:51,599
cough

2589
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:53,519
um

2590
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,560
i used to grow the cough uh that's why i

2591
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:58,800
say that i think nl5 haze is the

2592
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:01,520
is probably the most successful line

2593
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,679
ever released because there's probably

2594
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,080
seven to ten phenoes of it that still

2595
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:06,079
exist

2596
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:09,519
right yeah

2597
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,960
i mean there's the cough

2598
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,880
there's dog [ __ ]

2599
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,760
there's uh

2600
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,520
c5 there's the pith there's cuban black

2601
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,600
like i mean you can go yeah there's

2602
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,719
endless really there's and then there's

2603
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,840
and then there's a bunch of stuff of

2604
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:23,840
that and so there's like there's

2605
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:26,560
probably more phenos of that most things

2606
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:29,279
you're lucky if one pheno of a line from

2607
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:32,880
that old survived yeah

2608
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:34,079
and nl5 hayes has like freaking

2609
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,400
like i said you know it's probably got

2610
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:38,079
double digit elite phenos that are like

2611
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,359
30 years old

2612
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:41,920
snow high

2613
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,559
as much as um i butted heads with him

2614
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,800
over the years he had a [ __ ] amazing

2615
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,560
amazing double seize cut

2616
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,960
that i i don't know if he still holds it

2617
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,800
or not but if if uh people that are

2618
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,239
looking for a good devil's haze

2619
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,760
if he has some of those crosses out

2620
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:57,919
there he had a purples neville's haze

2621
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,400
male it was just that though both

2622
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:02,960
selections are phenomenal phenomenal

2623
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:04,319
yeah i mean it's it's it's got you know

2624
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,480
it's one of those things where when you

2625
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:08,399
cross two marijuana strains that are

2626
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:11,519
very unlike one another

2627
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:13,920
you can get some unique combinations

2628
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,920
of potency terps

2629
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,000
growth all that kind of stuff

2630
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,719
i hadn't heard that trout mouth i'll

2631
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,840
look into it i hope that's not the case

2632
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:24,239
so

2633
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,600
um yeah that would suck yeah

2634
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,279
i mean you know

2635
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,120
seed breeders and old schoolers and

2636
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:31,599
stuff we're like a canned tanker we're

2637
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:33,039
like a difficult bunch yes you know

2638
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,199
every generation has a group that

2639
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:36,800
doesn't get along you know you can go

2640
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:39,519
back and people will be battling each

2641
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:41,920
other on forums and you know people have

2642
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:45,360
strong held beliefs you know

2643
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:47,359
uh i mean tom hill is an amazing

2644
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:49,039
contributor to cannabis but boy was that

2645
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:51,519
dude tough to get along with yeah he's

2646
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:51,519
complex

2647
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,039
you definitely don't want to get on his

2648
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:56,719
wrong side you know

2649
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:57,679
because you'd take your head off you

2650
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,198
know

2651
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:02,480
um

2652
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:04,158
so i don't know but yeah i mean it uh

2653
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:06,158
um

2654
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:07,039
i don't have any idea

2655
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:09,839
uh

2656
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,039
what i know top dog we uh we both know

2657
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,679
top dog i don't know what he's

2658
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:15,840
specifically using on anything

2659
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:18,319
um aces

2660
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,560
uh used to be a lot more reputable

2661
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:23,198
they have some shadiness to them

2662
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,039
um but it's indisputable

2663
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:27,599
that uh there's some dudes in europe and

2664
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:29,600
other that gave them real cuts yeah they

2665
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,199
got that real cut of neville's haze i

2666
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,760
was just talking about they have the

2667
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:36,719
real a5 they got the re they got real

2668
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,840
cuts yeah um there's definitely some

2669
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,800
junk

2670
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,760
uh in their stuff but i mean that's haze

2671
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,000
so

2672
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,039
that's how that's just a part of using

2673
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,520
haze

2674
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:48,560
karel does not have his haze still he

2675
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,000
has

2676
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:54,239
a 35 year old cut of his haze by skunk

2677
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,840
one yeah the skunk one haze but he

2678
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:58,319
doesn't he doesn't have any original

2679
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:00,159
breeding hazes or anything like that

2680
01:33:58,319 --> 01:34:03,840
there it is possible

2681
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:06,559
that the haze c exists

2682
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,400
which is neville's old breeding male

2683
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,159
uh it's possible shanti has it it's

2684
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:14,479
possible it's in spain

2685
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:16,638
it's impossible for us to so far get any

2686
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:18,879
um verification

2687
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,800
other than them saying it exists

2688
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,039
so this this is a good point autoflower

2689
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:25,440
ak let me get this straight neville

2690
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:28,399
popped a handful of of haze seeds and

2691
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:29,359
found multiple gems in a in a bag from

2692
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:30,559
sam

2693
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:32,880
uh but you

2694
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:35,199
but you think sam's opening that line

2695
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:40,159
made it harder to find keepers that is

2696
01:34:35,198 --> 01:34:41,599
one of those um enigmas of haze right

2697
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:43,759
it is

2698
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,440
yep and like i said before

2699
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,119
opening

2700
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:49,919
you can lose it too

2701
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:52,799
yeah absolutely you can you can op

2702
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,639
and op open pollination for for for

2703
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,279
anybody that doesn't know open

2704
01:34:54,639 --> 01:35:00,480
pollination is basically taking

2705
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:02,559
males and females of the same line and

2706
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:04,638
breeding them together using no

2707
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:07,520
selection and just trying to preserve as

2708
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:09,520
much genetic diversity as you can yeah

2709
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:11,920
so sam has been very clear over the

2710
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:14,560
years for some stupid [ __ ] reason he

2711
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:17,679
never did selective breeding with hayes

2712
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,520
never he just decided to continually

2713
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,600
open pollinate it

2714
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,600
and so it seems like

2715
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,440
uh and you know we actually learned some

2716
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,679
pretty interesting stuff

2717
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:30,879
um from corel

2718
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:33,039
in that uh sam probably didn't have that

2719
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,960
many haze seats

2720
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:37,118
when he came over because he gave

2721
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:39,359
according to corel he gave

2722
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:41,359
he only gave 10 or 15 to

2723
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:44,158
positronics

2724
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,679
he only got tennis yeah neville only

2725
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:47,599
like there was me you know so maybe he

2726
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,880
only brought over some and he kept some

2727
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,320
from himself

2728
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,199
and

2729
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:55,599
it does seem like that everyone

2730
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:57,359
that got those original haze seeds from

2731
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,679
sam before he had a chance to do

2732
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:03,599
anything with them in europe

2733
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,600
that's where all the haze comes from

2734
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:08,079
pretty much for whether it's yeah yeah

2735
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:10,880
positronics positronics is where tom

2736
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:14,000
hill or old timers haze comes from

2737
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:17,118
you know corel had some neville had some

2738
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,679
sam still did open pollinate but then no

2739
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:21,920
one has really found any elites

2740
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,560
or anything from those open pollinations

2741
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,000
that they bred into things to my

2742
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,880
knowledge i'm not saying it's not in

2743
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,880
there

2744
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,199
but when you have a situation where most

2745
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,719
of the line is going to go 16 to 24

2746
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:35,198
weeks

2747
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:39,039
and they're admitting that 80 of it is

2748
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:40,879
junk and 10 of it is is nice and 10 is

2749
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:44,399
special

2750
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,679
finding that 10 that's special

2751
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:48,719
is hard

2752
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:50,639
yes it is finding a breeding male

2753
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:54,079
that is going to pass those special

2754
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:57,440
traits is even [ __ ] harder

2755
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:59,198
you know um yeah they got lucky

2756
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:01,599
for lack of a better term

2757
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:03,279
yeah and and realistically neville with

2758
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,639
whatever he was given

2759
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:09,198
he obviously did a better selection um

2760
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:12,239
based on either luck chance or what have

2761
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:14,079
you and the in in the continuous open

2762
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:16,319
pollination with sam basically open the

2763
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:18,479
line up so much you will not run into

2764
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,639
the same phenotype like that

2765
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:22,399
uh very often which is why you're

2766
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:24,319
probably seeing uh high amounts of

2767
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:25,359
variation and not running into the

2768
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:26,880
keepers

2769
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:28,799
and there's there's another interesting

2770
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:30,560
thing that we should maybe say too

2771
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,920
when it comes to that is that there's

2772
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,199
also a theory

2773
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:37,279
that a lot of the euros uh didn't like

2774
01:37:35,198 --> 01:37:39,039
haze by skunk one

2775
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:40,479
because they thought the skunk terps

2776
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:42,479
dominated

2777
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:45,839
the hazecross

2778
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:48,799
and also skunk one is primarily sativa

2779
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:51,520
so it was a sativa leaning plant crossed

2780
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,960
with a pure sativa yeah some people

2781
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,520
think that the reason why neville had

2782
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,359
such such success with it is because he

2783
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,520
was able to cross it to very different

2784
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:00,799
indicas

2785
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,440
g13

2786
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:05,840
northern lights and a lot of his most

2787
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:07,839
famous hash plant

2788
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:11,760
and there's phenos of those that all

2789
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:15,199
there's there's hash plant haze g13 haze

2790
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:17,119
nl5 haze they all still exist yeah

2791
01:38:15,198 --> 01:38:19,678
so some of it could be

2792
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:22,238
that he just had some nicer afghans that

2793
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:24,319
blended better

2794
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:26,718
that could be it too there's people that

2795
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:27,920
believe that pretty strongly yeah you

2796
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:29,760
know

2797
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:32,158
that maybe the things he was crossing it

2798
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:34,239
to was just nicer

2799
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:36,000
you know and it's also possible you know

2800
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:38,000
we don't have a lot of we don't have a

2801
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,198
lot of uh

2802
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,520
i mean do we have a bunch of

2803
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:42,799
cross-referencing from sam's early era

2804
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,600
matt

2805
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,199
well

2806
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,800
of just about what he was up to and what

2807
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:49,519
he was doing i mean that was one of the

2808
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,039
most the longest running and most

2809
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,719
angry

2810
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:54,079
part of the forums

2811
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:56,480
yeah remember when he was know it all

2812
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:57,679
for sure yeah he had a few names you

2813
01:38:56,479 --> 01:38:59,599
know had a few different names and

2814
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:00,800
people would argue over whether or not

2815
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,800
he was the neighbor to the hayes

2816
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,079
brothers what he knew whether it was

2817
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,920
true

2818
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,319
the one guy and it makes sense because

2819
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,719
back then only your good friends

2820
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:13,279
would know you were growing uh rob clark

2821
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:14,800
who i respect a lot backs them up yeah

2822
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:16,719
but they've been best buddies for 40

2823
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,880
years yeah

2824
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:20,800
you know um there's people that think

2825
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,960
that he stumbled upon skunk one it was

2826
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,400
already kind of mixed

2827
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,158
and he just kind of finished it there's

2828
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:28,079
he claims he started it we have his

2829
01:39:26,158 --> 01:39:30,879
version of events

2830
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,158
you know um and we don't have we don't

2831
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,679
you know there might be other there

2832
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:34,638
might be other aspects of it but it

2833
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:35,920
could be

2834
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,480
even that

2835
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:41,359
you know hayes and skunk had similar

2836
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:43,599
ancestors somewhere yeah

2837
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:44,559
because hayes was pure colombian

2838
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,800
yeah

2839
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:49,039
you know and so maybe it didn't cross as

2840
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,719
well as the pure afghans neville and

2841
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:51,840
shanti did make super silver haze

2842
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:53,279
together

2843
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,360
um

2844
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,759
i could tell that story because it's

2845
01:39:55,359 --> 01:40:00,880
pretty cool uh

2846
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:03,440
when neville was in jail in 1990

2847
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:07,679
somebody grew out some

2848
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:10,000
nl some nl5 by skunk haze seeds

2849
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,639
nl5 haze by skunk haze seeds and they

2850
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,319
found this crazy fino that became super

2851
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,600
popular in europe

2852
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:17,198
and

2853
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,400
when he got out of jail he started

2854
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:20,399
breeding it

2855
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:23,359
and uh

2856
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:26,399
he wanted to find he was trying to blend

2857
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:29,198
the three most famous european

2858
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:31,759
you know seed bank lines together yeah

2859
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:34,879
northern lights skunk haze

2860
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,079
he was trying to find some combo right

2861
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,359
and he wasn't that happy with it so he

2862
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:38,800
bred it for four or five years or

2863
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:40,880
whatever and then

2864
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:42,719
ben and alan drunkers who owned scentsy

2865
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,560
by that time he was working he was their

2866
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:45,679
head breeder because they bailed him out

2867
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,920
of jail

2868
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:49,679
and bought his company yeah uh when he

2869
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,239
was in a tight spot

2870
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:53,760
which he had eternal resentment for

2871
01:40:52,238 --> 01:40:55,439
um

2872
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:57,199
because basically it's like they kind of

2873
01:40:55,439 --> 01:40:58,879
were like we'll get you out of prison

2874
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:01,279
and get you back into holland but you

2875
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,520
have to give us all your [ __ ] yeah

2876
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:05,439
and so he and then they hired him and he

2877
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:08,239
went from being a business owner of the

2878
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:10,479
largest seed company in holland to

2879
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:12,879
the head breeder

2880
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:14,000
and had to give them all his work yep uh

2881
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,520
but

2882
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,520
be that as it may

2883
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,960
um the first cannabis cup i went to in

2884
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:22,960
1995 was named after jack herrera

2885
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,880
the whole thing was themed after the

2886
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,960
emperor wears no clothes

2887
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,480
jack was there they were doing all this

2888
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,198
[ __ ] about hemp was going to save the

2889
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:33,599
world and ben and alan drunkers being

2890
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:35,439
money-oriented dutch people they wanted

2891
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:38,800
to release a

2892
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:40,479
jack herrera strain yeah

2893
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,920
and so

2894
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:43,759
they uh

2895
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:45,279
say neville said it wasn't ready they

2896
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,600
said i don't care

2897
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:49,198
and they released jack herrera

2898
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:52,560
which was his

2899
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:54,079
nl5 haze by skunk haze hybrid

2900
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,360
yeah

2901
01:41:54,079 --> 01:41:57,039
and then

2902
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,639
uh after

2903
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:01,760
um

2904
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:03,359
after he left uh after he broke up with

2905
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,480
scentsy and went on and did his own

2906
01:42:03,359 --> 01:42:06,479
thing he

2907
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:07,759
started working with shanti who was

2908
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:09,118
younger than him and probably a little

2909
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,239
bit more vibrant and had a little bit

2910
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:12,319
more like

2911
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:14,319
verve to get going then than he did you

2912
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:15,920
know yeah um he started they started

2913
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:17,439
working under greenhouse and they

2914
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,480
started breeding

2915
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:22,479
uh a haze project which after two or

2916
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:24,238
three years of work i think became super

2917
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:26,479
silver haze

2918
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:30,638
mango haze and neville's haze that's

2919
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:32,879
correct yep and uh super silver haze was

2920
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:36,079
neville's preference

2921
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,920
uh mango haze was um

2922
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:41,760
shanti's preference

2923
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:44,319
um same uh same father different mother

2924
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:46,400
uh type of thing uh so half sisters i

2925
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:48,238
guess and then neville's neville's haze

2926
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:50,399
was only supposed to be

2927
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:52,479
a personal project

2928
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:54,559
right yeah it was only supposed to be a

2929
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:56,638
personal breeding project for his holy

2930
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,440
grail

2931
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:02,880
the grail that he never stopped chasing

2932
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:04,960
and um and that uh yeah that holy grail

2933
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:07,199
and then he they found such fire in it

2934
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:09,279
at first that they ended up releasing it

2935
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:11,118
yeah um and everybody that got those

2936
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:14,238
first few years of releases there was

2937
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:16,079
crazy sativa power in that weed yeah and

2938
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:18,799
that was kind of the tail end of

2939
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:21,439
neville's kind of like like intense

2940
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:24,000
contributions to breeding yeah mango

2941
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:25,759

3031
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,880

3032
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:45,840
called humboldt snow skunk five in

3033
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:47,199
florida i actually the girl who uh whose

3034
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,960
boyfriend and her brought it out to

3035
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:50,319
california actually lives not very far

3036
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,359
from me

3037
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:55,840
and it made it to eugene in glassblower

3038
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:57,439
circles and it was called snow

3039
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,960
yeah a lot of people called it eugene

3040
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:00,238
snow because it was from those eugene

3041
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,118
glassblowers

3042
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:04,479
it got brought down to our buddy csi and

3043
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:06,238
if you got it in humboldt it was

3044
01:47:04,479 --> 01:47:08,399
humboldt smell

3045
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:11,198
so it went from skunk five to eugene

3046
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:13,439
snow to oregon snow to humboldt snow and

3047
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:15,359
depending on who you got it from one of

3048
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:17,599
those names would be the name you you

3049
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:18,880
attributed to it

3050
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,520

3109
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:28,719
000 plants and it was actually

3110
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:29,759
interesting the way he did it people

3111
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:32,960
should know

3112
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,320
that he got medical cards for every six

3113
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:36,480
plants

3114
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:38,799
and he had a [ __ ] grid

3115
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:39,839
mat yeah he had a map of his whole

3116
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:43,360
property

3117
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:45,599
where you got a 10 by 10 and six plants

3118
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:47,598
and it was all numbered and every single

3119
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:49,760
one of those 32 000 plants had a [ __ ]

3120
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:52,480
medical card attached to it with six

3121
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:54,719
plants and a ten by ten that is fun and

3122
01:49:52,479 --> 01:49:57,279
he had a plan

3123
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:58,880
to have these all up and down california

3124
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:00,000
yeah and it was going to be eddie lap

3125
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,920
farms

3126
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,760

3133
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,639
um

3134
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:18,079
you could go out there you could default

3135
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:19,920
he would do a certain amount of work and

3136
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:21,840
a certain amount of basic food and this

3137

3138
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,000
let's let's be real but

3139
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:27,839
uh you know but you could and he did

3140
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,359
give a lot of stuff to patients and he

3141
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,480

3142
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:32,719
um

3143
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:34,399
he got kind of his ego into his head and

3144
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:36,079
uh they busted him

3145
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:38,079
and he got 10 years

3146

01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:46,480
and everybody was growing

3150
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:49,199

the real trinity does have some pine

3164
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:20,800

uh

3168
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:27,679

01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,760
chat about it here right this minute but

3170
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:31,920

pictures of is the same plant and it

3173
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:37,520
sounds like it was a super skunk hybrid

3174
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:39,920
was the last

3175
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:42,000
uh it's basically the the breeder it was

3176
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,440
a skunk it was a skunk hybrid that he

3177
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,920
crossed to a bunch of things he's kind

3178
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:48,158
of a rainbow hippie and and not the most

3179
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:50,719
uh you know a lot of these old-timers

3180
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:52,079
they're short on specifics yeah yeah

3181
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:53,920
they were doing a bunch of drugs and

3182
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:55,920
partying and taking acid and tripping

3183
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,800
around breeding things and not taking

3184
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,039
notes

3185
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:01,039
yeah and then some weed nerds 35 years

3186
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:03,840
later like what were you doing

3187
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:05,519
you know 1988 you know

3188
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,760
specifics what number was that and

3189
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:10,159
people are like oh man i don't know

3190
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:11,760
yeah you know but um but what we do know

3191
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:13,598
is that it was this it was it was a

3192
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,440
skunk hybrid that he bred for a number

3193
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:17,760
of years and the final thing he did was

3194
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:19,118
he crossed it to neville's super skunk

3195
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:22,400
from seed

3196
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:24,158
and the the fino number six got sold on

3197
01:52:22,399 --> 01:52:26,799
dead tour a whole bunch

3198
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:28,799
uh and got went out to colorado came out

3199
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,400
to california with us

3200
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,560
became very famous

3201
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:35,279
and it was only called skunk six by a

3202
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,800
very very small few groups it was we

3203
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:38,639
never called it insect there was

3204
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:40,560
multiple years of debate on whether or

3205
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:41,920
not the skunk six and the super skunk

3206
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:44,400
were the same cut

3207
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:46,399
yeah it took tracking him down and

3208
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:48,559
having him confirm it because all the

3209
01:52:46,399 --> 01:52:50,479
cali people just called it super skunk

3210
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:52,159
yeah and then some of the colorado

3211
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:54,879
people that were like his old dead tour

3212
01:52:52,158 --> 01:52:56,559
friends some of them called it the six

3213
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:59,520
so it's just that nickname [ __ ] again

3214
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:01,679
you know yep

3215
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,199
why aren't the nl's after five around if

3216
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:04,639
they were made

3217
01:53:03,198 --> 01:53:06,799
because

3218
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,960
uh

3219
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:11,199
greg well no he didn't neville didn't

3220
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:12,319
make use of them yeah greg explained

3221
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:14,879
this

3222
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:16,719
only the one and two were mostly indica

3223
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,880
they got progressively more sativa

3224
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:21,279
because they were rated on height

3225
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,880
and i think the six seven eight nine ten

3226
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:24,079
eleven neville just found to be a pain

3227
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,239
in the ass

3228
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:30,399
if you look back over his early [ __ ] in

3229
01:53:26,238 --> 01:53:33,198
like 86 and 87 and 88 or so

3230
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:35,598
you can see nl9 and l8 you can see

3231
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:37,519
different ones bred into things

3232
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,119
and then i think by 89 or 90 he had

3233
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:43,199
basically decided

3234
01:53:39,118 --> 01:53:45,118
i'm going to use nl1 nl2 and nl5 yeah

3235
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:46,238
and that's it so those are the only ones

3236
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:48,000
that really got

3237
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:49,839
really got blended

3238
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,158
that's really all it was you know he got

3239
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,239
him in 84 or 85 and he [ __ ] around

3240
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:57,759
them for four or five years and then he

3241
01:53:54,238 --> 01:53:59,039
settled on one nl5 female and

3242
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:02,000
i believe

3243
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:02,800
all the nl1 and two he used was male

3244
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,319
yeah

3245
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:06,480
yeah for the most part he used those as

3246
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:07,920
breeding kills

3247
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:09,919

3255
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,159
what else we got

3256
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:32,960
trinity was awesome i agree

3257
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:36,480
we have it today

3258
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:38,239
still has a big ass cola of trinity in

3259
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:39,439
their freezer from back in the day to

3260
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:40,559
compare to

3261
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:42,719
oh wow

3262
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:44,960
yeah and that's the hard part is all the

3263
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:47,039
people that were involved with trinity

3264
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:48,158
basically all lost it in the same two or

3265
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:49,039
three years

3266
01:54:48,158 --> 01:54:51,118
yeah

3267
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:53,118
and then by the time it floated back to

3268
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:55,519
people 15 years later

3269
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:57,920
there's half the crew thinks that it's

3270
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,360
real and the other half thinks it's even

3271
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:01,199
the people that think it's not real they

3272
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:03,198
think it's a close hybrid

3273
01:55:01,198 --> 01:55:05,279
yeah like it's got trinity in it no one

3274
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:06,879
says it doesn't have any trinity in it

3275
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:09,118
it's just a matter of is it the cut i

3276
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,520
remember

3277
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:12,559
you know and how is my memory from 1999

3278
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,400
to now

3279
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,880
and god knows how much it's changed

3280
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:20,238
environmentally since then and yeah it's

3281
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:23,599
a really hard thing to line up like that

3282
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:25,439
you know so um cactus is still around

3283
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:28,000
our buddy uh uh

3284
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:31,359
707 seed bank

3285
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:34,158
um has cat piss in his work

3286
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:35,039
i think that shoreline done outdoor

3287
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:37,519
is

3288
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:39,039
phenomenally more catfish than any other

3289
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,480
cactus i've ever smelled including the

3290
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:44,800
san diego that thing is so catfishy uh

3291
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:47,359
the the outdoor grow of it that i have

3292
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:49,039
here

3293
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:51,198
so yeah and there's there's different

3294
01:55:49,039 --> 01:55:52,639
there's there's more than one cat piss

3295
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:54,079
yeah and the captain's people do

3296
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:56,239
disagree

3297
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:58,479
on what is catfish there's some

3298
01:55:56,238 --> 01:56:02,079
pittsburgh cat piss and there's norcal

3299
01:55:58,479 --> 01:56:04,479
cat piss there's the socal cat piss that

3300
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:06,479
he's that matt's familiar with

3301
01:56:04,479 --> 01:56:08,238
and there's debates around all that [ __ ]

3302
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:09,839
too you know yeah

3303
01:56:08,238 --> 01:56:12,559
and a lot of them are like super silver

3304
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:16,239
haze types where the terpenolane kind of

3305
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:16,239
leans toward uh pissy

3306
01:56:16,319 --> 01:56:19,118
yeah

3307
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:21,519
yeah we still have the snow i remember

3308
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:24,399
the snow the snow came out of that same

3309
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:26,480
trinity came out of that same eugene

3310
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:29,439
glass blower small circles

3311
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:31,598
yeah um our buddy csi has had the snow

3312
01:56:29,439 --> 01:56:35,118
since probably 98-ish

3313
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:36,719
and he breeds it and all kinds of stuff

3314
01:56:35,118 --> 01:56:40,079
so it's there

3315
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:42,399
i don't know the the lineage on um

3316
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:45,279
shoreline at all i mean i'm i'm like the

3317
01:56:42,399 --> 01:56:47,598
last person to get it

3318
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:48,960
it seems it seems it's mysterious so i

3319
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:52,239
don't yeah

3320
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:54,239
albert walker exists yep it's around

3321
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:55,519
it exists

3322
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:57,519
so

3323
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:59,119
um and maybe i'll say this before we get

3324
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:01,280
off anybody that has anything old and

3325
01:56:59,118 --> 01:57:03,198
rare don't get rid of it

3326
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:04,960
yeah please don't uh right now

3327
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:06,719
especially with the way pricing is and

3328
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:09,039
what and what the pressures on the scene

3329
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:10,880
right now there's a real risk for a lot

3330
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:12,079
of cool genetic diversity to go by the

3331
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:13,920
wayside

3332
01:57:12,079 --> 01:57:15,840
um because people might not have money

3333
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,679
or might get into a bad spot

3334
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:19,440
and not they might get worried about all

3335
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:22,239
this is i can't even sell this for what

3336
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:23,919
i need you know it's not even worth and

3337
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:25,759
then they just decide to get rid of it

3338
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:27,118
and then you know five ten years from

3339
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,560
now there's a bunch of [ __ ] that we wish

3340
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:30,479
still existed

3341
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,920
yeah so if you've got something you love

3342
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:33,439
try to hold on to it because you might

3343
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,800
be one of the few people left that has

3344
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:36,559
it you never know

3345
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,159
yeah you might be one of those people

3346
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:39,520
that has a contemporary line that's

3347
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:41,759
missing

3348
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:44,000
you know 10 years from now 15 years from

3349
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,520
now if you love something hold on to it

3350
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,679
tight

3351
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:49,679
very much so so

3352
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:50,840
yeah

3353
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:52,480
dude you're at

3354
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:54,159
370.

3355
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:55,678
370. yep

3356
01:57:54,158 --> 01:57:57,519
things are climbing

3357
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:59,679
yeah they're slowly climbing

3358
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:01,679
i guess uh yeah well let's let's let's

3359
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:03,760
end this option and then maybe i could

3360
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:06,639
do one more and we'll

3361
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:08,159
talk about the nl projects and and kind

3362
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:09,520
of what we're seeing

3363
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:11,359
um

3364
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:12,560
and we are i think we're going to have

3365
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:16,079
some uh

3366
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:20,039
some natsos la cush crossed to nl5 at

3367
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:20,039
some point yeah

3368
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:24,719
yeah

3369
01:58:22,079 --> 01:58:26,238
i've been you know i uh the maui is he's

3370
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:27,920
had it for probably over a year it's

3371
01:58:26,238 --> 01:58:30,799
just a matter of making its way into

3372
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:31,760
rotations and being crossed to things

3373
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:33,440
you know

3374
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,679
yeah there's some really exciting ones

3375
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:38,638
the corn might be in there which i think

3376
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:41,599
would be an interesting cross uh the the

3377
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:43,840
male nl5 that that we have is our keeper

3378
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:47,199
so far is is uh

3379
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:49,119
a spitting resemblance to the purple

3380
01:58:47,198 --> 01:58:51,519
indica which i think is fascinating

3381
01:58:49,118 --> 01:58:52,719
since it comes from the same area

3382
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,239
yeah

3383
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:56,000
it is fascinating

3384
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:58,079
so that one's going to be also in the

3385
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,599
rotation seeing how that purple indica

3386
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:01,599
lines up with that male and i think

3387
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:04,159
that'll be pretty [ __ ] cool

3388
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:06,319
it will be i mean we you have hope

3389
01:59:04,158 --> 01:59:08,319
yeah you know

3390
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:10,319
there that ellie that people have been

3391
01:59:08,319 --> 01:59:12,799
that la coach by kim d people have been

3392
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:14,319
finding killer stuff in it yeah that's a

3393
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,239
great combo it sounds like it seems like

3394
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:18,639
that one really that one really is like

3395
01:59:16,238 --> 01:59:20,238
people send me pictures all the time

3396
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:21,920
yeah so

3397
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:24,638
yeah

3398
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:26,960
uh we can we could we could maybe get uh

3399
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:28,960
pip on here one of these days you know

3400
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,560
yeah

3401
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,960
he's a little shy but he's a good buddy

3402
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,800
of ours so we could always ask him you

3403
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,800
know you know right now is a tough time

3404
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:39,199
because uh the

3405
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:40,719
the industry itself has changed so

3406
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:42,799
rapidly in the past two years that it's

3407
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:45,039
a real it's a hard time to get people

3408
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:48,000
excited about talking about cannabis

3409
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:50,560
when it's so when the actual scene is so

3410
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,679
depressing right now yeah so many of our

3411
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,239
friends

3412
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:57,359
you know um and shout out to down with

3413
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:58,559
dirt he just recently passed um

3414
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:00,719
there's gonna be a lot more of that

3415
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:02,560
going on and it's sad but yeah shout out

3416
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,599
to him if you knew him send his family

3417
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,440
love

3418
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:07,599
and that's that's actually something too

3419
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:09,279
is like there's a not one of what i just

3420
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:10,800
said about the clones but about seed

3421
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:13,279
making too where like there's a lot of

3422
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:15,039
diversity at risk

3423
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:16,800
because people need to be able to make

3424
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:18,800
enough money to survive

3425
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:20,960
and as things get more centralized and

3426
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:23,199
more corporate larger scale and a lot of

3427
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:25,520
the small garage size grows and a lot of

3428
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:28,079
the passion type people start getting

3429
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:30,080
pinched financially it becomes a lot

3430
02:00:28,079 --> 02:00:31,840
more difficult to be like oh should i

3431
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:33,359
dedicate this space to something that's

3432
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,279
just for me

3433
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:37,359
or should i just grow the whole thing

3434
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:39,198
based on whatever my buddy says he can

3435
02:00:37,359 --> 02:00:42,319
get me for it right now

3436
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:45,039
and so a lot of experimentation um

3437
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,399
a lot of experimentation is at risk

3438
02:00:45,039 --> 02:00:49,760
because you've got to be surviving

3439
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:51,359
pretty well to be experimenting yeah

3440
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,960
and what matt was just saying is that

3441
02:00:51,359 --> 02:00:55,519
there's a lot of people staring at

3442
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,359
survival doesn't mean it won't like

3443
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:58,719
shift and change but right now there's a

3444
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:01,118
lot of people that have gotten used to

3445
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:02,480
living a certain way and making certain

3446
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:04,639
making money off a certain way and the

3447
02:01:02,479 --> 02:01:06,000
weed game is dramatically changing

3448
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:07,520
yeah

3449
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,039
you know it's really dramatically

3450
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,719
changing and so

3451
02:01:09,039 --> 02:01:11,920
uh the people that are taking it over

3452
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:14,000
right now they don't really care about

3453
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,520
diversity that much they just they just

3454
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,800
care about margin and wanting to sell

3455
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,639
you some [ __ ]

3456
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,719
so you could definitely lose a lot of

3457
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:21,520
[ __ ] in the next five or ten years

3458
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:23,840
yeah

3459
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:25,760
yeah there's there's leaf variegation in

3460
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:27,679
the headband and the chem d so i'm not

3461
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,840
surprising you see it in the progeny

3462
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:33,039

3465
02:01:34,479 --> 02:01:37,439
you know that

3466
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:40,960
that should vary right

3467
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:44,000
it varies it varies i mean it it it it's

3468
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:46,319
not specific it's not a three finger

3469
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,439
but it could have it could have five

3470
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:48,479
seven

3471
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:49,759

02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:11,759
from being the norm um and i

3482
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:14,880
made a great attempt at it anyway

3483
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:16,400
he's it's true that a lot of stuff does

3484
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:18,400
but there still is if you think about it

3485

02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:57,519
matt and a buddy to talk about the bull

3554
02:04:56,158 --> 02:05:00,399
rider cut

3555
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:02,560
but uh yeah it um

3556
02:05:00,399 --> 02:05:04,000
see bull rider predated me in san diego

3557
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:05,520
by the time i got down to san diego

3558
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,000
there was no bull rider to be smoked

3559
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:09,440
except for afghani bull rider and i i

3560
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,039
did have experience with the afghani

3561
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:12,638
bull rider it was one of the most dank

3562
02:05:11,039 --> 02:05:14,560
loud things that i ever smelled in my

3563
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:17,359
life but trying to find the original

3564
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:20,800
bull rider was just not happening um a

3565
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:22,399
while ago a buddy grayskull um

3566
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,840
sent me some seeds of the original bull

3567
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:26,158
rider backseat

3568
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:28,078
and i was originally gonna give it to

3569
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:30,238
someone to tissue culture and thank the

3570
02:05:28,078 --> 02:05:33,118
[ __ ] stars i didn't do it

3571
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:35,359
and um recently sent those back to

3572
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:37,279
uh uh grayskull so he could have them

3573
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:38,719
tissue culture so hopefully

3574
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:41,359
yeah bull mountain that that was

3575
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:42,800
actually it was called bulgani i think

3576
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:44,559
is what they kept calling the afghani

3577
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:45,920
bull rider up in mendo when they brought

3578
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:48,239
it down

3579
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:50,800
yeah that's that's my coverage on bull

3580
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:53,519
riders probably some kind of nl5 haze if

3581
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:54,560
betsy it really is it's sister and and

3582
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,480
to be

3583
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:58,079
um compared to it i would guess like

3584
02:05:56,479 --> 02:06:01,198
skunk one no five hey something like

3585
02:05:58,078 --> 02:06:03,519

3586
02:06:01,198 --> 02:06:05,198

3587
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,880

hog's breath was a san diego original uh

3606
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:49,440
one of my first mentors was the person

3607
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:51,520
who bred it and uh he passed away

3608
02:06:49,439 --> 02:06:52,879
but yeah it was

3609
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:54,159
god knows what it was he said so many

3610
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:55,760
different things and it could have been

3611
02:06:54,158 --> 02:06:58,078
just keeping people on their toes but it

3612
02:06:55,760 --> 02:07:00,239
was [ __ ] dang it was very like cheesy

3613
02:06:58,078 --> 02:07:01,759
toe funk [ __ ]

3614
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:03,439
it's a little bit of sweet depending on

3615
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:05,119
how you uh grew it you could get some

3616
02:07:03,439 --> 02:07:08,719
fruity expressions from it too but most

3617
02:07:05,118 --> 02:07:13,839
of it the way james grew it was [ __ ]

3618
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:13,840
foot funk cheesy nasty it was great

3619
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:17,440
it's good people are a bunch of people

3620
02:07:16,078 --> 02:07:20,000
are saying they still have it or it's

3621
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:22,078
still kicking around hawaii and

3622
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,359
still this and that so that's nice i

3623
02:07:22,078 --> 02:07:25,118
mean

3624
02:07:23,359 --> 02:07:27,279
you know one of the things that's cool

3625
02:07:25,118 --> 02:07:29,759
is like if you live in an area where

3626
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:31,679
there's not so much pressure to change

3627
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:33,599
a lot of old cool [ __ ] can just kind of

3628
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:36,158
stay around because people can grow it

3629
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:38,400
and find a home for it pretty easy

3630
02:07:36,158 --> 02:07:40,319
in california you get stuck where it's

3631
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:41,439
like oh this you have to do this you

3632
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:42,960
have to do this

3633
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:44,000
oh that doesn't work anymore you have to

3634
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:44,960
do this

3635
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,639
yeah

3636
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:48,239
you know and now it seems like it's

3637
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:50,000
really bad where

3638
02:07:48,238 --> 02:07:51,519
prices are so low and things are so

3639
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,639
rough like people don't even know where

3640
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:54,159
to turn

3641
02:07:52,639 --> 02:07:55,359
and by the time they start growing

3642
02:07:54,158 --> 02:07:57,679
something they think is going to be the

3643
02:07:55,359 --> 02:07:59,439
next big thing it's already played out

3644
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:01,039
yeah and there's a lot of there's a lot

3645
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:02,799
of hype and there's a lot of flash in

3646
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:04,880
the pan type stuff

3647
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:06,639
where for a minute it gets a good ticket

3648
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:08,800
and people are all excited about it and

3649
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:11,920
then one too many greenhouses or indoors

3650
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:13,599
gets it and then nobody wants it yeah

3651
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:16,078
you know so

3652
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:17,679
after we was just that that there's one

3653
02:08:16,078 --> 02:08:19,920
thing about after we always remembered

3654
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:22,319
like any time after we was in a hybrid

3655
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:24,560
that that terp would dominate real well

3656
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:27,679
and it was to me the way uh the way i

3657
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:31,280
always smelled it was like a a blueberry

3658
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:32,880
cantaloupe type it was just so addictive

3659
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:34,719
and it's it's always stuck with me over

3660
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,560
the years and my favorite f gui cross

3661
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:38,239
was done by bodhi and it was the afkoui

3662
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:40,639
double purple doja which is like an

3663
02:08:38,238 --> 02:08:42,959
apollo 13 type and he's got these

3664
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:45,118
[ __ ] massive yielding [ __ ] half

3665
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:46,480
gooey terps ah he sent me some of the

3666
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:48,399
last of those seats that i really need

3667
02:08:46,479 --> 02:08:51,439
to get some more made

3668
02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:54,158
yeah two dog was asking um

3669
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:55,519
i think sourdee preceded any of the

3670
02:08:54,158 --> 02:08:56,960
other stuff

3671
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:59,199
in the sense that

3672
02:08:56,960 --> 02:09:00,880
um when sourdy was getting passed around

3673
02:08:59,198 --> 02:09:04,078
that's what it was called

3674
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:06,880
it was years before new york city diesel

3675
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:09,679
or east coast sour diesel or

3676
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:11,118
you know shroomy cut or you know

3677
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:12,800
amish or

3678
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:14,238
you know all that different types of

3679
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,480
stuff and that's what makes it so

3680
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:18,718

02:11:45,359 --> 02:11:50,319
probably do a whole show on on what we

3751
02:11:48,158 --> 02:11:53,279
know and don't know that would upset a

3752
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:56,719
bunch of people uh the good part is that

3753
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:58,479
most of the diesel cuts are pretty nice

3754
02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:00,800
most of the most of the phenos that

3755
02:11:58,479 --> 02:12:02,559
exist are pretty nice weed so if you get

3756
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:05,199
stuck with one that isn't the really

3757
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:07,440
nice it isn't the real deal

3758
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:08,799
you know um

3759
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:10,479
and then someone was saying something

3760
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:12,639
before about what'd you see first urkel

3761
02:12:10,479 --> 02:12:14,718
or lavender i kind of saw them at the

3762
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:17,599
same time

3763
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:19,279
um right around 0-304

3764
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:21,679
yeah

3765
02:12:19,279 --> 02:12:23,198
so i uh that was right around that same

3766
02:12:21,679 --> 02:12:25,039
time and that was about

3767
02:12:23,198 --> 02:12:26,319
four or five years after i had popped

3768
02:12:25,039 --> 02:12:28,719
mendo p

3769
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:31,439
uh there was definitely nothing

3770
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:33,039
like mendo p when it first came out

3771
02:12:31,439 --> 02:12:35,439
um as far as something that just

3772
02:12:33,039 --> 02:12:37,198
naturally turned purple that deep

3773
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:38,960
there's plenty of afghans that turn

3774
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:41,519
purple with cold

3775
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:43,359
and you know as as october came along

3776
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:45,920
and outdoor and stuff if you left let

3777
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:48,000
them out and let the second run go late

3778
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:49,679
and it got cold at night they could turn

3779
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,158
deep purple but

3780
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:54,399
um it was four or five years before that

3781
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:56,399
next wave came

3782
02:12:54,399 --> 02:12:57,759
so and i don't know when it started

3783
02:12:56,399 --> 02:12:59,679
that's what i was saying before a couple

3784
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:01,520
a long time ago is uh

3785
02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:03,840
we don't really know what year urkel

3786
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:04,880
popped or where it popped or who did it

3787
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:07,360
exactly

3788
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:08,480
there's various people that claim it but

3789
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:10,479
um

3790
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:12,000
one thing we know is that it wasn't

3791
02:13:10,479 --> 02:13:13,839
called purple oracle when it first

3792
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,279
showed up

3793
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:17,279
and i don't want to say the name because

3794
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:18,960
it's not my story to tell and i don't

3795
02:13:17,279 --> 02:13:21,279
want to give people

3796
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:22,960
you know ammo to [ __ ] fake it but

3797
02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:24,399
yeah it was not called purple oracle

3798
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:26,319
when it first showed up yeah just like

3799
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:28,638
just just like i was saying before like

3800
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:29,920
you don't want to give out uh

3801
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:32,719
you don't want to give out sometimes

3802
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:35,520
real info because people will use it

3803
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:37,039
and um like you know like i don't watch

3804
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:39,840
this [ __ ] but matt watches a bunch of

3805
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:41,840
like murder mysteries and you know uh

3806
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:44,078
people doing bad stuff to each other

3807
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:46,000
yeah and a lot of times the cops and

3808
02:13:44,078 --> 02:13:49,118
stories will put out one or two things

3809
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:51,359
that's a lie about the story

3810
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:53,598
right did you know that matt

3811
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:56,238
they do that and they do that because

3812
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:58,800
so they can weed out all the

3813
02:13:56,238 --> 02:14:00,638
all the like hot tips that they get that

3814
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:03,039
use that bit

3815
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:05,118
yeah because human nature you put out a

3816
02:14:03,039 --> 02:14:07,039
story and some people will start calling

3817
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:08,639
and start oh i saw

3818
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:10,399
and so they put out some fake

3819
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:12,319
information just to make sure that they

3820
02:14:10,399 --> 02:14:13,439
can weed out because if we if he said

3821
02:14:12,319 --> 02:14:15,118
what it was

3822
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:16,479
then there'd be a bunch of stories about

3823
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:18,000
oh my uncle

3824
02:14:16,479 --> 02:14:20,399
from white thorne

3825
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,078
grew this and we called it that so it

3826
02:14:20,399 --> 02:14:23,039
must be

3827
02:14:22,078 --> 02:14:26,000
you know

3828
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:28,000
by my seeds

3829
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:30,158
know i have kryptonite and it throws a

3830
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,840
lot of mendo perps phenos there's a lot

3831
02:14:30,158 --> 02:14:33,039
of people that have mendo perps and

3832
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:35,360
their stuff that don't want to say

3833
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:36,319
there's mendo perps in their stuff

3834
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:38,639
yeah

3835
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:41,439
you know it's really obvious when when

3836
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:43,118
it's in your stuff yeah there's uh

3837
02:14:41,439 --> 02:14:45,118
there's there's a lot there's a lot of

3838
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:47,439
there's a lot of modern stuff that has

3839
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:49,039
mendo p in it that people never want to

3840
02:14:47,439 --> 02:14:51,039
admit that it's in it

3841
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:53,599
yeah so

3842
02:14:51,039 --> 02:14:56,158
you know but that's pretty common

3843
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:59,599
yeah jim ortega on a podcast i don't

3844
02:14:56,158 --> 02:15:01,679
[ __ ] know that guy is a sketch

3845
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:02,960
yeah about being in public he did some

3846
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:04,719
prison time

3847
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,920
uh he came from a different era of

3848
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:07,920
cannabis

3849
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:09,279
i don't think he has any interest in

3850
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:12,000
being public

3851
02:15:09,279 --> 02:15:14,399
although i would personally love

3852
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,639
to pick that dude's brain for a while

3853
02:15:14,399 --> 02:15:18,559
yeah um you know

3854
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:23,039
so

3855
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:24,480
um but yeah jim ortega is uh you know he

3856
02:15:23,039 --> 02:15:25,679
gave some really important strains to

3857
02:15:24,479 --> 02:15:27,598
neville

3858
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:29,840
yeah he did yeah and he's kind of a

3859
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:31,440
total mystery and cush 4 is going to be

3860
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:33,679
one of the ones that you will see in the

3861
02:15:31,439 --> 02:15:35,519
nl5 cross

3862
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:37,440
crosshairs

3863
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:40,079
and maybe maybe in the hawaiian lights

3864
02:15:37,439 --> 02:15:43,839
too if we're lucky

3865
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:46,399
did i take cuts i i used to take cuts of

3866
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:48,560
and most a lot of breeders do this uh

3867
02:15:46,399 --> 02:15:50,319
csi certainly does is

3868
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:52,480
you take cuts of everything you're about

3869
02:15:50,319 --> 02:15:55,519
to bloom from seed stocks so if you find

3870
02:15:52,479 --> 02:15:58,399
it and you love it you still have it

3871
02:15:55,520 --> 02:16:00,480
so that's why the mendo perps survived

3872
02:15:58,399 --> 02:16:02,719
they have 50 year old seeds will they

3873
02:16:00,479 --> 02:16:02,718
pop

3874
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:06,960
what do you think unlikely

3875
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:09,199
unlikely i will say that

3876
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:11,359
that the couple seeds of mendo perps

3877
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:12,879
that i had um although it wasn't called

3878
02:16:11,359 --> 02:16:15,279
that i named it that but the couple

3879
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:18,719
seeds i got were 21 years old at the

3880
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:21,359
time that i got them and they popped um

3881
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:25,118
20 year old seeds can pop 50 year old

3882
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:27,679
seeds seems like it's going way back

3883
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:30,479
i mean that would be like 1970

3884
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:32,159
yeah right that's way back

3885
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:34,318
cheese northern lights yes there will be

3886
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:36,000
cheese northern lights absolutely i

3887
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:37,760
think this is a great one great idea

3888
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,599
from philadelphia he said i'd like to

3889
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:41,760
hear anonymous people on the podcast

3890
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:43,760
like they say what their role is without

3891
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:45,359
saying exactly who they are giving up

3892
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:47,840
identifying details that would be

3893
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:47,840
awesome

3894
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:52,718
and we are planning to pop the purist

3895
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:54,959
very very soon we are going to follow

3896
02:16:52,718 --> 02:16:57,358
through on um the the newest northern

3897
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:59,438
lights acquisitions unfortunately we did

3898
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:00,399
not get as many of those seeds as we did

3899
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:02,559
of the

3900
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:03,760
nl5 and the hawaiian lights we are going

3901
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:06,079
to try to do something with them

3902
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:08,559
worthwhile if if anything

3903
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:10,879
is worth work doing with if that makes

3904
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:10,879
sense

3905
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:14,880
uh there's a question i'm pretty sure

3906
02:17:12,718 --> 02:17:17,358
that that there's some mendo p in the

3907
02:17:14,879 --> 02:17:19,039
cookie i'm not gonna go into that whole

3908
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:20,960
thing either right now because that's a

3909
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:22,639
whole story and it would probably cause

3910
02:17:20,959 --> 02:17:25,039
a bunch of guff but

3911
02:17:22,638 --> 02:17:27,759
i guess it it was good for two hours

3912
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:30,080
yeah [ __ ]

3913
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:32,079
that's all good i do believe that there

3914
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:33,599
is mendo p in

3915
02:17:32,079 --> 02:17:35,519
in cookies

3916
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:36,398
uh the story is definitely for another

3917
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:38,639
time

3918
02:17:36,398 --> 02:17:39,840
there's a lot it's kind of complex but

3919
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:40,839
uh

3920
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:43,599
you know

3921
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:45,439
um i i mean there's

3922
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:46,799
really what it boils down to too is

3923
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:49,120
there's

3924
02:17:46,799 --> 02:17:51,599
20 20 some years ago there wasn't nearly

3925
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:53,840
as many people breeding as there is now

3926
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:56,079
because there wasn't money involved

3927
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:58,000
uh as much there wasn't really american

3928
02:17:56,079 --> 02:17:59,359
seed companies doing stuff and so most

3929
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,200
people breeding were doing it just kind

3930
02:17:59,359 --> 02:18:02,399
of for the love of it or

3931

should try to like give good weed to

3932
02:18:02,398 --> 02:18:09,119
their friends yeah and so as a result of

3933
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:11,519
that an inordinate amount of

3934
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:13,760
um the stuff that people were working on

3935
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:15,599
made its way into a lot of the stuff

3936
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:17,120
that's famous now

3937
02:18:15,599 --> 02:18:18,558
