64
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,039
million years ago when i first came to

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,878

and coming from illinois where i'm from

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,760
where it's flat as a pancake because of

71
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,958
the glacier it was i thought it was like

72
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,280
ireland

73
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,840

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,560
and flowers and it was brutally cold

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,878
where i lived and it was so nice here

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,840
and i had no idea it got to like 110 and

77
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:35,439

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,319

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,760

83
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,920
uh that's not my favorite part of

84
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,039

91
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,079
warm nights and good people good fun

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,799
yeah indeed

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,040
so what what is our topic for tonight as

94
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,519
far as education goes as far as

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,400
education goes i thought we would chat

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,720
about a couple of things um we would

97
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,079
talk about maybe sort of like the

98
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,479
very late 90s early 2000s uh period in

99
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,719
the west coast

100
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,240
and because there's a whole bunch of

101
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,400
stuff then

102
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,639
that's pretty pertinent to now

103
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,879
it was all kind of going on and then i

104
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,960
think we might talk about at some point

105
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,600
probably will fit in because it's been

106
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,399
uh a big topic amongst us this week is a

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,840
little bit of like authenticity yeah and

108
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,399
uh how to you know how to address that

109
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,439
yeah how do we address authenticity in

110
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,758
these uh times where everybody's making

111
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,199
money off something being authentic

112
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
well yeah and people you know people

113
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
have their own their own motivations

114
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,478
their own wants needs and desires

115
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:12,159
yeah you know that type of stuff and so

116
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,639
you know because um

117
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,240
some cherry pie cush talk

118
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,918
cherry pie might be able to fit into

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
that a little late i've kind of avoided

120
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,319
the whole cookie thing yet

121
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
yeah it's probably a couple episodes on

122
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,360
its own and it's pretty complex

123
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,359
so

124
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,759
uh we probably will chat about that at

125
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,919
some point but it needs uh that one

126
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
needs some fleshing out a bit

127
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,599
yeah i would say yeah yeah it's gonna be

128
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,038
a deep one

129
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,039
yeah that's a deep one and there's a lot

130
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,560
of people making a lot of money off it

131
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,478
and there's a lot of rep on it so the

132
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,160
more money and rep you have it kind of

133
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,639
ties into the authenticity thing we were

134
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,400
just talking about yep uh you start

135
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,840
talking history and it interferes with

136
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,478
anybody's money or rap and all of a

137
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,279
sudden they're extremely upset yeah you

138
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,240

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,079
uh

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,759

i remember it differently

145
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,680
in a way that fits my world view and

146
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,199
paints me in a positive light

147
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,959
yeah that's for sure and you know

148
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,800
relating to weed history like you run

149
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,839

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,720

00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,680
is them yes

170
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,918
right yeah um but the you know for some

171
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,680
reason the blue bonnet seems to throw

172
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,318
these days at least

173
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,240
uh some really potent blueberry terps

174
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,919
and it's not mine i didn't make it i

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,000
don't get to take credit for it but i

176
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,198
did use it it's just yeah to be

177
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
transparent yes he did use it so i had

178
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,120
my i mean

179
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,879
there's actually a tie-in to

180
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,959
well i had my own blueberry line that i

181
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,680
created before um during the time that

182
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,198
blue bonnet was being made and the

183
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,840
lone star was kind of competition to me

184
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,439
at the time and i was very egotistical

185
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,478
about my blueberry of course because

186
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,598
everybody thinks they have the best

187
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,758
blueberry and i used it and it did breed

188
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,439
true for blue traits and very beautiful

189
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,080
blue terps and very pretty but it didn't

190
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,399
have much potency or resin production to

191
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,680
speak of and i think lone star did it

192
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,318
better than i did i really do

193
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,079
so yeah and what we're lucky

194
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,759
is that it still exists

195
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,240
yes and you can still get it from a

196
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,360
number of different sources yes

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,038
um

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,479
a ton so

199
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,719
uh we're getting there i think we're up

200
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,598
to a decent time so we're going to start

201
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
um

202
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,519
and uh these talks have kind of been

203
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
we've we've been kind of moving forward

204
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,519
we started in the beginning in the 90s a

205
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,240
bit now we're starting to move forward

206
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,038
we actually still have like a third wave

207
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,038
of seed banks that matt and i want to do

208
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,038
um that we never actually dealt with

209
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,038
that involves canada and everything else

210
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,240
but it starts to get a little bit more

211
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,319
dispersed and difficult to get the the

212
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,200
accurate stuff so it's taken us kind of

213
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
a while yeah so there's a lot to it and

214
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
there's a lot to cover you don't want to

215
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,519
leave out a lot of stuff and

216
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,879
you don't want to forget a lot of stuff

217
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,479
and some stuff we do leave out and

218
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,320
forget and have to go back and tag

219
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
because it isn't that important so yeah

220
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,360
and that's kind of you know that's kind

221
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,120
of one of the things about these talks

222
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
is there a bunch of history there's some

223
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,159
there's some speculation there's some

224
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,239
bullshitting

225
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,919
um they're trying to be conversational

226
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,200
and tell people about the memories that

227
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,039
people have

228
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
um they you know we'll talk about things

229
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,679
but they get people been under shape

230
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
already

231
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,359
um so rather than talking about like the

232
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,519
third wave of seed banks i thought we

233
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,080
could chat more about like what was

234
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,000
happening on the west coast yeah which

235
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
is where matt and i both live

236
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
uh what was happening on the west coast

237
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
in that era

238
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:20,000
and how specifically california and how

239
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,278
that kind of like started to impact what

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
came after

241
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,240
yep

242
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,600
right so

243
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,200
just to let everybody know um in 1996 in

244
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,159
november they passed the 215 act uh the

245
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,600
proposition 215 in california and that

246
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,519
made it was the first state where you

247
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,440
had medical

248
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,120
yeah now you know medical was uh

249
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
very restrictive at first and it was

250
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,080
only about four or five conditions that

251
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,519
it applied to

252
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
and the cops had spent their whole

253
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
career just busting anyone with weeds so

254
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,519
they were also slow to change yes

255
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
because they saw weed and they were like

256
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,360
[ __ ] you it's weed i'm arresting you

257
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
and so people think that it like just

258
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,399
became legal

259
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:05,359
in 1997 uh it did not

260
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,240
um it started a slow process

261
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,320
right

262
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,639
um and the era we're gonna talk about is

263
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,959
sort of like the very beginning of when

264
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,600
gorilla started to end and that process

265
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,879
started to really take place yeah you

266
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,560
know there was the very beginning of

267
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,000
medical in california so things were

268
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,000
starting to open up

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,919
people were starting to be less

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,919
secretive

271
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,879
and as we mentioned on shows before i

272
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,240
think it was 1999 that overgrowth

273
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,000
started

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,278
and not that long after the cannabis

275
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,639
world started

276
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,720
i i don't know the years on when they

277
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,799
started um so

278
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,560
you know after a few years you had this

279
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,439
network of people

280
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:47,199
um that were connecting via these

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,399
via these you know these forums yeah

282
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,240
and chatting and stuff like that and so

283
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,039
one that ended up happening

284
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
is

285
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,360
uh you know this this started a whole

286
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,240
wave of different things it started uh

287
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,519
there was you know really the forums

288
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
were the first time you could really

289
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,078
ever trade outside your circle that you

290
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,040
knew in person yeah

291
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,399
you know

292
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,278
right

293
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,759
yeah i mean even even today i still see

294
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,439
people uh you know in other states where

295
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,559
they say you know i can't get that clone

296
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,640
i live in this state and it kind of

297
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,879
blows my mind because back then even

298
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,799
like we didn't all live in like people

299
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,559
were getting bubba clones from ohio you

300
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,159
know that were in california you know

301
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,078
what i mean like if

302
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,519
you didn't necessarily go to the state

303
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,879
to get it

304
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
yeah and i mean you know one of the

305
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,600
things that's interesting about that is

306
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,719
that

307
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,680
you know there's there's different

308
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,440
people uh for a lot of people um we have

309
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,639
a good buddy of ours that lives back in

310
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
the midwest

311
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,480
and

312
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,000
you know for him the forums and ig and

313
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,120
discord and stuff like that was a way

314
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,720
for him to talk to other weed nerds yeah

315
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,879
right but for somebody like me who lives

316
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
in mendo like everyone around me does

317
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,919
what i do

318
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
yeah so there's no shortage of hanging

319
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,078
out like i'm surrounded by people like

320
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,879
me so there was some people that like

321
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,719
were

322
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,838
you know really intent upon getting on

323
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
there and that was their mode of

324
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,519
communication

325
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,360
yeah and some of us just lived in places

326
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,759
and stayed off all that

327
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,519
yeah you know so like when you popped up

328
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,600
or whatever it doesn't really like

329
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,039
correlate to like what you're up to we

330
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,759
all lived in the shadows yeah right so

331
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,559
tying into that i'm uh i'm probably in

332
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,679
my

333
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,599
i don't know what it is i'm probably in

334
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,638

337
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,120
it's weird to say his name his name was

338
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,039
ron uh yeah no right

339
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,600
yeah yeah and uh uh matt knows ron

340
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,159
very well very well yeah and ron was

341
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,639
runs a character and he's still around

342
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,679
and he did this thing where he started

343
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,680
throwing these harvest parties in fall

344
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,359
uh in

345
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,838
in my area and he actually threw him

346
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,919
he'd rent like a big-ass [ __ ] house

347
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,440
in sonoma county uh healsburg outskirts

essentially yeah and he had like a

350
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,639
catering company and so this thing would

351
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,879
be you pay a certain amount of money and

352
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,000

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,160
greenhouses full of neville's haze yeah

502
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,080
like 10 foot tall plants direct planted

503
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,038
in the ground

504
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,519
so

505
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,079
it was just uh yeah vic high it was just

506
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,160
really neat because it was a lot of it

507
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,599
was a lot of connected people it was a

508
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,640
lot of people that were active on the

509
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,558
forums

510
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,240
um it was

511
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,759
five or six or seven years uh before the

512
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,880
reversal era

513
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,720
yeah

514
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,679
so everything was everything was reg

515
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
seeds

516
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,000
yeah

517
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,000
everything there wasn't any nes one i

518
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,519
don't even think i'd heard the term s1

519
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,720
outside of a book

520
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,639
yeah

521
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,319
i don't think so i doubt so everything

522
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,759
yeah everything everything was hybrids

523
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,079
you know and people would bring their

524
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,759
hash bring their seeds bring their own

525
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,678
personal breedings

526
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,519
and it was like a way instead of mailing

527
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,840
each other and giving out addresses and

528
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,960
dms and all that it was like a super

529
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,798
swap meet

530
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,558
right

531
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,839
and so it was really neat in that regard

532
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,240
because

533
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,240
for one thing uh ron had a catering

534
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,319
business so part of the money that

535
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,480
everybody pitched in

536
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,038
he hired his whole team

537
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,400
and you and he made two meals a day for

538
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,400
three days

539
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
that's wild that's cool so yeah you got

540
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,480
to sit there and roll joints and smoke

541
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,319
and shoot the [ __ ] and pull tubes and

542
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,759
trade seeds and then you're [ __ ]

543
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,918
starving right and like some like tuna

544
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,839
on crisps comes by the thing you know

545
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,440
and you're like i want some of that and

546
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,720
you're just so high and you start eating

547
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,320
some of that and drinking now you feel a

548
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
million times better

549
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,639
um and so

550
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,640
the reason i bring that up is because

551
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,480
while now with a lot of these events and

552
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,280
a lot of these lives and a lot of a lot

553
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,919
of times like uh putting a face to a

554
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,798
name has become common yeah but back

555
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,799
then it was uncommon yeah very

556
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,798
so it was like really it was really it

557
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,038
was really like unusual and neat you

558
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,918
felt special yeah

559
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,919
you know and i mean there was uh you

560
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,559
know there was times where i mean i went

561
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,400
i went there i think yeah the foods were

562
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,119
to die for holds they were really good

563
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,640
they were fully catered full on meals

564
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,399
they'd have snacks and hors d'oeuvres

565
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,559
that would be get brought around finger

566
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,320
food and stuff it was pretty decadent

567
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,678
yeah you know and then just like

568
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,439
anything else even if you're an

569
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,000
experienced smoker

570
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,840
you start smoking 8 10 15 kinds of weed

571
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,599
you don't normally smoke

572
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,599
yeah and it's the first time you're

573
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,519
smoking all of them

574
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,439
even weak or moderate weed will get you

575
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,960
pretty baked yeah eventually if you're

576
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,400
just pulling all day non-stop yeah you

577
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,000
get [ __ ] yeah

578
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
and so you know there was different

579
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,440
things where it was like you can't hang

580
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,079
out with everyone

581
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,279
yeah so you know you make friends some

582
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,359
friends i made there um you know

583
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,000

that different types of stuff and um

589
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,279
you know uh eddie just it was kind of

590
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,038
just like a who's who

591
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,038
yeah and a lot of a lot of the times

592
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,519
those people fletch people that weren't

593
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,919
very well known then yeah but now

594
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,519

595
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,280
you know and they have some of the best

596
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,879
seed banks you know some of the best

597
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,720
breeders around

598
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,840
some of the best collections of weed

599
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,000
around

600
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,519
yeah um you know when i went there i

601
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,240
didn't have most of the stuff that i

602
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,038
have now but i had i had the maui and i

603
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,038
had the the chem 91 and the super skunk

604
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,879
and i had the super dog

605
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,240
um my uh

606
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,039
my buddy who doesn't like to be

607
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,759
mentioned uh you know uh from staten

608
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,079
island he came a couple years with us

609
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,599
you know yeah because we were still like

610
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,439
right in the middle of doing that super

611
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,480
dog project then

612
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,320
so

613
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,839
yeah we had different phenos we had the

614
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,000
super skunk we had different things we

615
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,038
had hash that we had sifted from things

616
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,319
and

617
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:12,960
all that so it was just a really neat

618
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:15,359
gathering and time period yeah people

619
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,200
keep asking like what happened but i

620
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,439
think i think we did a good job of

621
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,919
recreating a little bit of that just a

622
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,000
few years ago um a lot of people weren't

623
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,919
invited you know because it was smaller

624
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,519
but i think i think that there's still

625
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,679
an ability for our community to pull

626
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,759
together like that and have these big

627
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,480
events where people just get along chill

628
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,240
and smoke weed um yeah so it was a

629
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,798
privilege because i wasn't around for

630
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,798
for the wrong parties at all but it was

631
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,400
a privilege to be a part of the the

632
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,240
canned illuminati parties those are it

633
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,559
was [ __ ] insane to be a fly on the

634
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,720
wall at those events yeah i mean they

635
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,759
keep they do keep happening

636
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
um

637
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,879
but i i will say that like they probably

638
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,960
won't happen like that quite again

639
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,080
no um just for the simple fact that [ __ ]

640
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,079
changes yeah you know uh nobody knew who

641
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,319
csi was then

642
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,079
nobody knew who fletcher was then

643
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,240
nobody who i was that you know i mean

644
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,240
there was people that were known you

645
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,000
know but a lot of them were we were all

646
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,000
in our 20s or whatever just trying to

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,880
figure out you know various aspects of

648
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,960
life

649
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,640
yeah you know and we were all learning

650
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,880
and trading from each other and seeing

651
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,280
what was up and it was uh you know it

652
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,760
was just days of and there also wasn't a

653
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,319
bunch of money or rep involved

654
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,480
yeah it was kind of like the last era

655
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,960
before that era started

656
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,360
yeah it was so we were all young

657
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,200
innocent and dumb and you know and all

658
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,839
that kind of stuff and

659
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,080
less of a competitive nature maybe yeah

660
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,158
we were all i mean honestly

661
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,918
i came home with so many seeds from that

662
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,960
event and i gave away

663
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:53,120
you know thousands of seats yeah for

664
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,759
free yeah we just traded yeah oh you've

665
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,959
got some sweet tooth by blockhead from

666
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,038

and uh

689
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:45,440
you know and uh yeah in the forum era uh

690
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,519
caleb was white trash redneck or

691
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,759
inspector

692
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,759

oh my gosh

696
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:56,720
so

697
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,159
we're gonna bounce around because all

698
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,120
those different things sort of inter

699
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,080
interact so just to kind of like put a

700
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,719
um

701
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,359
you know ron's parties were where a lot

702
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,440
of us made friendships with each other

703
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,519
um where a lot of us met for the first

704
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,759
time it brought together different

705
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,038
disparate groups of

706
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,919
uh weed heads yeah all from their 20s

707
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,400
through their 40s you know 50s

708
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,720
um it went on for a number of years

709
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,320
uh it you know it happened in the in in

710
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,798
the falls there was a lot of fire

711
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,319
outdoor and i should also mention

712
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,359
because this is pretty important to that

713
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,359
era where this is before the urkel

714
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,839
and the and the purple craze really took

715
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,719
off yeah and so

716
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,558
um that's really important because

717
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,440
all good weeds still got grown and was

718
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:50,000
sold yeah there really hadn't been waves

719
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,240
where it was like get this one cut

720
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,319
yeah and this cut you can sell all of

721
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,079
that that hadn't really happened yet now

722
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,480
i i attribute a lot of that to [ __ ]

723
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,240
jason king too for hyping cuffs up so

724
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,640
[ __ ] hard that era

725
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,480
i mean you know it's it's it's hard i i

726
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,120
i don't necessarily attribute it to him

727
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,278
i attribute it to the brokers

728
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,719
sure because i can't i can't talk about

729
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,359
other areas but like in mendo let's say

730
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,038
0-405

731
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,879
if you wanted to have a 50 lighter and

732
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,158
you wanted to sell every gram of your

733
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
weed you grew

734
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,480

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,240
um

750
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,519
what were the all the popular things you

751
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,000
can think of

752
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,278
were at that party both as flower and

753
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,400

uh brothers grimm was crossed into a

758
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,480
different amount of stuff

759
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,919
yeah um

760
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,599
you know and then you know a bunch of

761
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,600
classics and things like that that would

762
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,519
go around nikai was still doing big

763
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,480
stuff federation was still doing big at

764
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:22,158
that time

765
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,759
uh people i can answer that question

766
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,840
someone just said where's jason king

767
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,759
he's on maui uh we'll we'll talk about

768
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,000
that in a minute um because that was

769
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,599
actually well that that'll overlap but

770
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,679
it really was

771
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,599
it really was like you know you hear

772
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,519
about the legendary harvest festivals

773
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,439
that happened in humboldt or mendo small

774
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,240
little gatherings and stuff

775
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,480
um that's really what it felt like to me

776
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,558
yeah it felt like being able to go to

777
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,759
one of those type of things and

778
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:49,759
back then

779
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,000
you really just talk shop and weed with

780
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,038
your close group of hermit friends

781
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,440
yeah

782
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,278
so getting to getting to go to like and

783
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,278
hang out with dozens of different people

784
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,480
for three or four days and chat and chat

785
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,200
it up

786
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,960
uh really set the foundations and a lot

787
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,159
of the a lot of the friendships and

788
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,759
stuff uh for later yeah it really made a

789
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,840
big difference i think

790
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,079
um frank you know friendships were

791
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,879
forged there transfers were made there

792
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,759
bit you know ideas of things

793
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,440
yeah

794
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,960
for a lot for a large part of it and i

795
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,159
think like when you started coming in

796
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,360
heavy

797
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,440
like it was all a bunch of that stuff

798
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,798
yes yeah it was still very much around

799
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,880
like when i first started coming in

800
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,879
heavy i was looking for the blue widow

801
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,399
clone i was looking for the the sweet

802
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,840
thing clone i was looking for all that

803
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,439
[ __ ] yeah you're looking for all that

804
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,959
and that was like that was everywhere i

805
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,038
mean that was like what everybody had in

806
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,640
clones what they had in flower and hash

807
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,879
and seeds and all these different types

808
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,880
of stuff yeah you know

809
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,559
kyle was there documenting it for high

810
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,480
times although i don't think ron let him

811
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,079
actually made an article about it

812
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,839
yeah because he wanted to keep it like

813
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,918
on the down low and not [ __ ] it up you

814
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,319
know yeah for sure um

815
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,240
but uh but you know it was interesting

816
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,759
and the reason why we're gonna kind of

817
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
bounce around all these different types

818
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,960
of stuff is it all overlaps

819
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,159
yeah

820
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,399
right so

821
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,320
um somebody asked about jason king it's

822
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:13,119
probably a good time to to chat about

823
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,639
that a little bit sure so

824
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,398
at that time

825
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,200
uh there was this guy's name's jason

826
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:18,479
king

827
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
and he

828
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,079
had this idea

829
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,398
that i'm gonna take a bunch of pictures

830
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,240
of famous strains

831
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,079
and then i'm gonna write my own super

832
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,759
opinionated blurb about each one of

833
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,918
these things yeah

834
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,278
and he called it the can of bible

835
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,600
and i don't think anybody knew what he

836
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,919
was doing at the time uh would be would

837
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,678
matter but what he did which is super

838
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,720
cool is he came out with about three can

839
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,880
of bibles

840
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,960
yeah and they sort of document this

841
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,600
whole like late 90s through early to

842
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,319
mid-2000s era

843
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:53,359
right before the clone wars

844
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,759
where all these specific clones of kush

845
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,158
urkel sour all that started just

846
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,480
dominating and a lot of these random

847
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,520
hybrids started to becoming hard to find

848
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,558
yeah

849
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,440
right

850
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:08,000
um so he came out with this can of bible

851
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,519
and i remember getting it and uh one of

852
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,599
the coolest things about the first can

853
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,200
of bible was that the entire first

854
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:16,879
introduction

855
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,399
uh is written by one of my weed heroes

856
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,360
uh rob clark

857
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,918
yes

858
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,918
right and rob did rob did this thing

859
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,720
where he wrote this big introduction

860
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,440
into the can of bible which honestly

861
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,679
i'm not sure anyone could have done that

862
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,759
and given as much legitimacy to jason

863
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,120
king

864
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:40,158
ron clark writing a big long seed

865
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,398
history and clone history introduction

866
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,240
yeah because like i've said before ron

867
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:47,678
wrote the bible for

868
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,278
seed breeding rob sorry rob rob ron rob

869
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,679
clark wrote the bible for seed breeding

870
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,159
marijuana botany he wrote hashish

871
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,919
uh he's legendary he's an encyclopedic

872
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,399
knowledge he's definitely like one of

873
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,679
the elders of the whole marijuana thing

874
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,839
yeah you know

875
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,080
uh he's made lasting contributions to

876
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,079
cannabis and so him writing that and

877
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,480
what he did is he outlined

878
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,839
which strains which was a huge debate

879
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,319
even back then

880
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,319
yeah which strains went to amsterdam as

881
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,158
clone onlys

882
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,359
and which strains went to amsterdam as

883
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,640
seedlines

884
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,639
yeah and a timeline of who gave what

885
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,200

886
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,960
over there yeah and then a timeline of

887
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,880
like all these different seed companies

888
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,640

versions of things yeah that was one of

890
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,960

967
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,760
for the old school guys though you know

968
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,280
what i mean like but nothing like guys

969
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,280
are hard to talk to but nothing like it

970
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,960
was yeah before you couldn't even find

971
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,359
how to contact an old guy at least now

972
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,358
they have like maybe an ig page or some

973
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,519
some way you can track them down

974
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,119
that's true when i first got into this i

975
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,918
remember i tried tracking down dj's

976
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,919
short to to speak to him you know

977
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,679
no dice you had to find where he was

978
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,960
going to be speaking and see him in

979
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,398
person if you wanted to get a hold of

980
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,320

very true very true like there are

1018

me [ __ ] nuts i always got along well

1020
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,599
with him yeah right and on top of that i

1021
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,800
was very sympathetic to what he was

1022
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,559
trying to do

1023
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,119
yeah just another weedner trying to

1024
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,799
[ __ ] put the pieces together yeah i

1025
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,440
strongly disagreed with him about

1026
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,519
certain things you know yeah and all

1027
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,920
that you know and we would battle about

1028
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,599
you know all kinds of [ __ ] you know um

1029
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,358
but that's not that's not any different

1030
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,440
than today with people

1031
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,519
um but he was documenting and there's a

1032
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,119
lot of there's a lot of things in there

1033
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,960
you know like you talk about like the

1034
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,880
bull ride there's a lot of stuff

1035
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,800
yeah that fell off the wayside that's

1036
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,720
documented yeah

1037
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,560
you know um and uh and so i started

1038
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,679

1039
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,960
stuff

1040
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,440

and you know and it was pretty neat in

1090
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:09,679
that regard um because

1091
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,199

00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,358
that's been lost

1095
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,280
yeah but there's a ton that's in those

1096
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:20,880
books but there's video but there's

1097
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,560
picture evidence and there's various

1098
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,320
aspects right

1099
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,679
and uh

1100
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,838
you know so

1101
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,598
um if people are interested because of

1102
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,519
that close relationship

1103
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,960
um i had a bunch of stuff that ended up

1104
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,000
in that book

1105
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,320
um

1106
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,719
the the i grew the dog both i was in

1107
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,160
this process then of growing a bunch of

1108
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,879
my favorite strains completely organic

1109
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:47,358
and then full salt

1110
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,200
yeah then in the same room at the same

1111
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,960
time right next to each other and then

1112
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,719
doing a bunch of blind taste tests with

1113
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,679
me and my friends and trying to actually

1114
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,559
see

1115
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,559
yeah

1116
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:59,440
which is better

1117
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:02,000
right so i so there's there's uh the

1118
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,960
chem 91 is in there is both dog and chem

1119
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,559
dog

1120
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,199
grown both ways

1121
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,639
uh my mendo perps is in there the snow

1122
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,919

1123
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:14,319
my super dog seven cut that i lost is in

1124
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,240
there which is a hybrid between the uh

1125
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,400
myself and the guy from staten island

1126
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,399
made this line it's basically a super

1127
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,400
skunk chem dog line

1128
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,358
um the purple effects

1129
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,200
yeah uh which is uh mendo perps crossed

1130
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:31,039
with fx which is a cool story um

1131
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,439
actually somebody said coral reef that's

1132
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,039
not mine but uh our buddy fletch has

1133
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
been hunting for that for a super long

1134
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,719
[ __ ] time yeah so if anybody knows

1135
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:44,400
where the coral reef is uh hit us up

1136
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:46,480
but anyway like huh that that that um

1137
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,800
that superdog thing is is the odd

1138
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,039
connection that me and you have where i

1139
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,960
spent years and years and years trying

1140
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,440
to figure out who made the [ __ ] super

1141
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,519
dog by asking around the whole chem fam

1142
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,200
all that [ __ ] and at one point i

1143
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,880
couldn't get any [ __ ] answers like

1144
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,078
half half the people would say yes it's

1145
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,920
jesus it's the same thing it's just

1146
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,839
another name you know we made it yeah

1147
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,559
you know yeah it didn't turn out to be

1148
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,679
that way but i remember before we met i

1149
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:14,239
remember in 2010 i made a superdog 2010

1150
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,679
trying to recreate what i had read about

1151
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:17,759
in the canada bible because i could

1152
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,440
never [ __ ] find it and many many

1153
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,880
years later when we finally interacted

1154
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,400
i'd realized you were the source of the

1155
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,519
super dog and that was really

1156
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,079
interesting because it was such a big

1157
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,318
long chase for me because of that book

1158
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,920
i i remember i mean i i don't really

1159
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:30,800
want to tell the story of how i lost at

1160
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,920
all but

1161
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,000
um i i remember like i mean i had it at

1162
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,039
all those ron parties i passed it out

1163
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,599
freely to a bunch of people um i gave a

1164
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,960
bunch of superdog hybrids uh to

1165
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,039
mandelbrot

1166
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,679
and it ended up being a lot of the basis

1167
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,440
of a lot of his males uh that he started

1168
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,239
using to get started because even back

1169
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,720
then

1170
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,000
everyone had to use pollen yeah

1171
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,358
not that everybody doesn't use pollen

1172
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,760
today but everybody had to use like

1173
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,078
males yeah like full regular males

1174
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,839
reversals were

1175
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,359
six seven eight years away

1176
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,318
yeah then um so i i didn't even we

1177
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,078
didn't even know it was the only

1178
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:11,838
reversals anyone ever heard of is

1179
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,839
accidental herms yeah that was reversals

1180
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,440
and sometimes if people wanted to make

1181
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,838
accidental herms

1182
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,318
they would torture their plant

1183
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,679
and rotalization

1184
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,279
they would make it dry out they would

1185
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,199
make it almost die they would [ __ ] with

1186
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,640
its life cycle they would just torture

1187
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,519
it and see

1188
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,480
can i get it to pop a bunch of pollen

1189
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,358
right

1190
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
yeah

1191
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,400
so

1192
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,239
technique yeah like i don't have like i

1193
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,240
lost the super dog i lost the purple

1194
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,399
effects but there's write-ups in that

1195
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,199
book of it

1196
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,480
right

1197
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,239
which is pretty neat because then

1198
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,318
there's there's at least pictures of it

1199
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,559
yeah that's how it got documented and

1200
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,318
why we still know about it

1201
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,480
yeah and i should tell i should tell a

1202
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,480
funny story just because so

1203

known right now called the mothership

1209
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,000

sativa um and jason just raved and raved

1211
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,239

1212
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:17,599
girlfriend's friends to mail it to him

1213
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:19,118
in uh in lake county yeah right so

1214
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,960
you're thinking today you know with all

1215
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,119
the mailing tech that people have you're

1216
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,720
thinking some like small innocuous

1217
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,200
package or whatever

1218
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,598
yeah so this this [ __ ] thing shows up

1219
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,000
and it's a box that's about a foot a

1220
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,160
foot wide and a foot you know this and

1221
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,079
two feet deep right yes

1222
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,039
big [ __ ] box

1223
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,640
you know

1224
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,960
and we open it up

1225
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,118
and inside are two mother ships with a

1226
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,559
bunch of with a bunch of stuffing around

1227
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:49,119
them in one gallon pots tied to stakes

1228
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,318
and they're like they're like 18 to 24

1229
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,720
inches tall

1230
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,920
yeah so instead of the person mailing us

1231
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,519
cuts

1232
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,480
they mailed us like

1233
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,920
one gallon pots of dirt and 18 to 24

1234
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,358
inch tall plants

1235
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,039
in that box that's all there was you

1236
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,078
open the box and it's like two plants in

1237
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,719
there

1238
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,318
yeah that's wild but it was so unusual i

1239
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,639
think i don't think the post office was

1240
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,639
hip yet to like weed and like especially

1241
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,239
plants in the mail sending big ass

1242
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,759
plants in the mail no probably yeah and

1243
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,919
there's actually in that can of bible

1244
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,760
there's some uh there's some pictures of

1245
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,000
that mother ship because i was one of

1246
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,359
the first people that grew it um because

1247
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,559
i actually had running grow rooms and

1248
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,639
there's pictures of the mother ship at

1249
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,239
eddie lep's property there's pictures of

1250
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,440
the mothership from my greenhouses and

1251
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,279
stuff it was a really unusual plant but

1252
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,119
but yeah it got mailed to us in the most

1253
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,839
sketch way imaginable

1254
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,160
i remember in cana bible i think it was

1255
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:41,679
the mothership that at one point jason

1256
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,440
king was trying to say this has to be

1257
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,519
related to hp13 because i've never

1258
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,838
tasted anything like this that was one

1259
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:50,719
of those extreme speculations that he

1260
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,159
was uh known for i mean i should say i

1261
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,159
mean he's my friend and everything like

1262
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,838
that but you read the descriptions of

1263
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,078
like the dog and the chem dog and

1264
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:01,199
different things yeah and i even wrote

1265
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,200
down like lineage in history for him

1266
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,799
and then when he went to do his artistic

1267
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,480
interpretation of what he wanted to

1268
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,960
write you read it and you're like oh

1269
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,280
that's [ __ ] yeah oh well

1270
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,880
oh well but that happens all the time

1271
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,119
people talk about all this journalist

1272
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,119
quoted me incorrectly or took me out of

1273
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,440
context or whatever else

1274
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,559
so but at least that's a documentation

1275
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,519
and it was there

1276
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,400
yeah

1277
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,119
you know

1278
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,318
um and well so one thing i'll say and

1279
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,039
then we'll move on and we'll talk a

1280
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,159
little bit about eddie's situation right

1281
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,719
is that

1282
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,598
um so we did

1283
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,598
uh

1284
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,480
i'm gonna lose my train of thought but

1285
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,400
um jason decided to do a can of bible

1286
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,318
release party

1287
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,400
for the second can of bible and he

1288
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,318
decided to invite everyone that

1289
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,240
contributed to the book

1290
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,639
with pictures right and everyone that

1291
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,318
helped him put together and who's who

1292
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,879
and um

1293
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,639
they uh and he rented out this very this

1294
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,838
very magical place which i don't know if

1295
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,759
most people have heard of there's this

1296
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:00,960
place called ore springs in mendocino

1297
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,119
county

1298
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,960
and it's a natural hot springs

1299
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,119
um and you know so it's got all these

1300
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,960
like cabins in the woods and stuff and

1301
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,119
all this beautiful redwood and it's

1302
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,119
right next to the monk huh

1303
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,519
no i'm saying yes okay and it's it's

1304
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,318
right next to montgomery woods which has

1305
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,920
some of the tallest trees in the world

1306
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,559
right i think three out of the five

1307
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,400
tallest redwoods are all in mendocino

1308
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,799
county right next to this this hot

1309
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,480
springs yeah so it's pretty magical

1310
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,280
place right

1311
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,880
so

1312
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,240

1313
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,400

whatnot and it's the same thing like one

1317
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,000

1487
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,400
right

1488
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:19,519
and so i just remember

1489
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,200
like walking away from there and uh

1490
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,280
just being like just i just thought i

1491
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:24,558
was going to get a wealth of information

1492
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,640
yeah

1493
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,240
and in the hours and hours that i talked

1494
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:29,039
to him i don't i don't even know if i

1495
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:30,959
got

1496
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:31,838
too many tidbits

1497
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,880
yeah

1498
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,039
no

1499
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,318
you know and then if you read his book

1500
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,358
now it's gonna sound like i'm dissing

1501
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,800
him it is a very very rudimentary way of

1502
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,639
growing inside

1503
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,079
it is yeah definitely

1504
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,838
now the one thing i will say that i

1505
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,640
think is super cool about his book is he

1506
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:50,960
does describe a bunch of uh

1507
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,879
weed that he smoked when he was younger

1508
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,039
that's my favorite part of the book

1509
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,680
and then he also does this thing where

1510
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,759
he has this i mean we didn't no one used

1511
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,799
the word terpenes back then but he tried

1512
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,359
to make like an olfactory chart yeah

1513
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,079
like a smells chart and break down what

1514
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:10,880
smells are related to what yeah it was a

1515
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,640
really good chart and it was a fantastic

1516
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,640
chart i highly recommend it still

1517
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,400
because anything that trains you to

1518
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:17,679
speak about things in language is

1519
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,280
helpful yeah

1520
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:22,000
yeah so i mean he was talking about like

1521
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,760
squirrel cage fans and you know i mean

1522
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,318
but that's kind of like you know he kind

1523
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,920
of grew in trailers in oregon and

1524
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:30,480
and use that

1525
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,599
used very 80s tech and never really

1526
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,480
advanced right um

1527
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,559
but be that as it may despite being very

1528
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,519
disappointed by talking to him about

1529
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,319
things i still bought like 400 450 of

1530
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,559
his seats yeah every line he had the

1531
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,558
velvet the moonshine the blueberry the

1532
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,079
flow i bought you know

1533
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,119
i don't know 75 to 150 of them yeah

1534
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,599
right

1535
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,119
um and i and i i went home and i grew

1536
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,039
them all out

1537
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,280
um i think is the name of the book is

1538
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,519
like cultivating exceptional cannabis or

1539
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,880
something like that yeah that's it

1540
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:07,039
right off the top of my head something

1541
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,039
like that it's got a really pretty flow

1542
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,558
plant or something on the cover yeah

1543
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,159
extremely purple

1544
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,680
i think it's a flow but some other

1545
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,078
people have said it's a blue satellite

1546
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,318
too like there's some some

1547
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,440
discrepancies on that as well well one

1548
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:22,079
of the things i mean when you

1549
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,480
interviewed uh chimera and red

1550
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,079
yeah you know um you know one of the

1551
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,679
things that chimera is good friends with

1552
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,920
dj so he's not going to say anything

1553
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,519
rude but what he did say is he kind of

1554
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,599
basically admitted that he thought that

1555
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,159
everything that he had was like the same

1556
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,359
line yeah and it was just different

1557
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,440
express like

1558
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:41,119
dj would see an expression within the

1559
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,838
line and he would be like oh this is its

1560
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,920
own thing it's blue velvet yeah and if i

1561
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,679
just breed stuff with expressions like

1562
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,599
that it's its own thing

1563
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:52,318
but that's not really what was going on

1564
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,838
either because he was crossing opposite

1565
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,558
to to

1566
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:58,318
opposite when he was doing line breeding

1567
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,960
working directional which is what you

1568
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,119
don't do it was very artistic take on

1569
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,280
breeding for the time and he and in

1570
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,599
fairness like we said before i they were

1571
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,359
writing the book as they were going you

1572
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,920
know like these were guys just getting

1573
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:13,838
into canterbury there was no books to be

1574
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,599
had you know at the time when dj was

1575
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,519
doing this so mad props to him for

1576
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,318
[ __ ] doing what he did i i was able

1577
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,759
to

1578
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:21,279
uh

1579
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,400
work at the bunch of his work that i'm

1580
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,359
stoked on

1581
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,280
i'm not as stoked on his uh human work

1582
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:28,880
um as far as

1583
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,960
human breeding but other than that you

1584
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,039
know like as far as cannabis breeding i

1585
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,639
i owe a big debt of gratitude to him i

1586
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,558
mean i'm not but i just you know it's

1587
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,440
one of those like he

1588
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,280
that's the conundrum right is this

1589
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,880
you see all this amazing stuff you see

1590
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,880
how it all works you get it yourself and

1591
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,838
i grew up imagine people listening i

1592
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,960
grew out 450 seeds over the next year

1593
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:52,000
yeah

1594
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,079
and uh

1595
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,159
know i'd like to say i found a few

1596
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,839
keepers that i i miss

1597
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,118
yeah i did

1598
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,798
yeah i did i it it was unbelievably

1599
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,318
beautiful a lot of it

1600
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:06,960
especially pre-cookie there was

1601
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,440
lavenders there was blues there was pink

1602
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,280
there was purple there was various

1603
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,440
shades of in between

1604
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,240
it didn't have a lot of terps

1605
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,798
uh

1606
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:19,118
and it didn't have a very potent high

1607
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,880
most of it yeah yeah for sure um but

1608
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,920
when i out crossed it to different

1609
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,240
things

1610
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,079
i got way better weed

1611
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,759
yeah than anything of the pure lines i

1612
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,359
got from him so you can imagine how

1613
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,799
[ __ ] excited i am right because now

1614
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:33,199
there's no seed bank there's no

1615
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:35,519
middleman it's like i'm getting

1616
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,399
hand-written manila envelopes from the

1617
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:41,440
guy

1618
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,680
yeah the real deal holyfield mm-hmm

1619
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,480
am i going to find the fire

1620
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:48,318
yeah here it comes right

1621
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,679
you know [ __ ] labeling backing

1622
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:51,358
everything up i mean you know how it

1623
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,118
goes when you're running hundreds of

1624
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,480
things and you want to keep track of it

1625
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,119
what the [ __ ]

1626
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,159
yep you know it's uh it's a huge pain in

1627
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,920
the ass

1628
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,039
yeah i just recently did that i mean

1629
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,440
people were talking about you know

1630
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:05,838
popping 450 seeds in the in the chat not

1631
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,559
finding anything i just recently popped

1632
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:12,318
almost the same amount of uh

1633
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,000
stuff from from uh blue lines and uh

1634
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:16,239
went through all of it and had a very

1635
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,760
similar experience now i i i will say

1636
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,159
something because there is some there is

1637
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,880
like a an economic aspect that we don't

1638
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:25,759
talk about right where back then

1639
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,400
um you know most fire indoor was you

1640
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,200
know four to forty five hundred

1641
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,838
yeah a pete yeah so

1642
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,759
it was really easy to grow flower

1643
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,599
and have a side room or two with a

1644
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,119
couple of lights in each for

1645
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,000
experimentation

1646
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,400
yeah

1647
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,318
you know the the rate you know a 12

1648
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,680
lighter could was was everything you

1649
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:49,920
need in life if you wanted to be so

1650
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,318
the economics were really easy to allow

1651
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,480
people to experiment and [ __ ] around

1652
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:56,480
yeah now things are super tight and it's

1653
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,318
gotten quite hard and mathematics and

1654
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,559
economics are much more difficult right

1655
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,719
in this particular period of time

1656
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,319
yeah um but back then

1657
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,480
you know it was like that's what kept

1658
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:08,159
the cropping from being boring

1659
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,358
i got a question for you this is a good

1660
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,358
question this is from the chat but it's

1661
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,279
a good question and relevant where did

1662
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:15,519
that swami guy come from was he around

1663
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,079
when you were hanging out

1664
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,798
so i no

1665
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,079
no no no no no

1666
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,559
no

1667
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,559
that's weird

1668
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,358
i mean he's a pretty recognizable

1669
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:30,239
character

1670
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,558
yeah

1671
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,759
you know yeah you wouldn't have even if

1672
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,200
you didn't become friends with him or

1673
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,599
whatever like you wouldn't have mistaken

1674
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,039
him no i don't think so no and you know

1675
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,318
we'll get we'll get to that i don't want

1676
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,480
to i don't want to break it up but we'll

1677
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:44,558
get to that um when we talk about the

1678
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,280
authenticity part in a little bit here

1679
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,880
yeah sure um as far as that goes because

1680
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,400
there's a bunch of people that one of

1681
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,640
the things about cannabis i'll talk

1682
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,639
about super briefly is that you can just

1683
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,719
sort of step out of the shadows

1684
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,639
yeah and then people are like i don't

1685
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,879
believe where this person came from if

1686
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:03,039
i'm i'm i'm who i am i would have known

1687
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,079
him yeah

1688
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,719
you know

1689
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,559
um so you know it's it's one of those

1690
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,159
things where uh

1691
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,599
there's a lot of shady characters in

1692
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:12,798
cannabis

1693
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:15,440
and there's a lot of and there's a lot

1694
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:17,119
of people who make good and bad opinions

1695
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,480
about people on the internet that you

1696
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,640
have never met and you don't hang out

1697
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,639
with in real life yeah

1698
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,318
you know matt and i are friends in real

1699
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,239
life yes

1700
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,519
you know like we're real life friends

1701
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:30,318
we've made

1702
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,960
made real love to each other so uh

1703
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,719
you know platonically from a distance

1704
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,720
you know all that

1705
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,159
um but you know it it's different and

1706
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,639
you have a bunch of people who become

1707
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,558
fanboys or girls of different people

1708
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:44,078
and attack whoever they want to and

1709
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,599
stuff like that you know and it becomes

1710
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,480
difficult because they don't know their

1711
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,079
enemy

1712
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,960
and they don't know their friend

1713
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,599
yes

1714
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,480
either yeah they know like a a social

1715
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,240
media construct of that person sure

1716
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,119
which is not the same thing

1717
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:59,039
no

1718
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,798
so but we'll get to that in a bit so

1719
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:02,318
scrolling back you've got you've got

1720
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:05,039
ron's parties

1721
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:06,960
right yeah being sort of a nexus for

1722
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,880
this thing you've got uh

1723
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,039
you've got the can of bible parties

1724
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,400
which were another nexus bringing people

1725
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,039
together you know

1726
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,280
um yeah but i was i have to say i was

1727
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:18,480
super disappointed because i really feel

1728
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,119
like

1729
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,440
you know if you take home 450 seeds from

1730
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,200
four different lines from a breeder and

1731
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,599
uh you don't find anything you really

1732
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:30,159
think or one or want to keep you know

1733
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,920
yeah that's super disappointing

1734
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:34,159
yeah that it is disappointing that's a

1735
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,519
lot of money so it's a lot of my i mean

1736
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,358
he gave me a good deal don't get me

1737
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,280
wrong it's not like i paid full custody

1738
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:40,400
because i'm at the no he likes to make

1739
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,798
money too

1740
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,039
but the the yeah but the the size of the

1741
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:46,880
room the amount of just everything that

1742
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,519
goes into the economics of growing it's

1743
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,200
a lot of money it's a lot of time

1744
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,719
and you know like i talked before it was

1745
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:55,838
like you know there's there's eight or

1746
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:58,798
ten american elites of nl5 hayes

1747
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,400
yeah i ran 60 70 in l5 hayes and didn't

1748
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,480
find any of those keepers

1749
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,160
yeah but other people did

1750
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,400
yeah you know

1751
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,118
um so dj was a disappointment just in

1752
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,519
the sense that he comes from like a a

1753
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,240
different generation of weed nerd i

1754
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,920
think yeah where they're just not that

1755
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,719
deep into detail

1756
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,920
yeah

1757
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,239
you know i mean one thing you can say

1758
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,280
about rob clark or sam skunk man it's

1759
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,039
whether or not you want to believe a

1760
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,559
bunch of what they say or not they're

1761
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,960
heavy on detail

1762
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,480
yeah a lot of the old a lot of the old

1763
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,119
guys you talk to

1764
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,199
um you know they're light on detail

1765
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,280
yeah they don't remember or they try to

1766
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:37,519
make it up they did it

1767
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,880
yeah but they just don't like it's even

1768
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,400
the same thing with like the sour

1769
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,838
stories or a lot of stuff that happened

1770
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,880
in the 90s that we try to get to the

1771
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,400
bottom of

1772
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,559
yeah they didn't know it was going to be

1773
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,480
important

1774
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,480
i'm pretty sure dj thought he was always

1775
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,760
going to be important based on having

1776
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,199
met him i'm pretty sure he always

1777
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,799
believed he was going to be yeah i mean

1778
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:57,519
like i said over that weekend i probably

1779
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:59,280
talked for five six hours seven hours

1780
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:00,798
yeah we were there for three days all we

1781
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,720
were doing was like

1782
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:04,798
literally smoking weed and hanging out

1783
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:06,078
and shooting the [ __ ] eating food

1784
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:07,599
dude i would have loved to have had that

1785
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,720
opportunity with him i just it just

1786
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,359
seemed so

1787
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:13,759
not interested in discussing anything

1788
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:15,598
with me and it was it was it was hard

1789
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,000
because i i did look up to him so much

1790
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,280
and it's not that i lost respect for him

1791
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
but it's just like

1792
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:25,680
the more i learned about breeding and

1793
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,440
hands-on the more i learned about

1794
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:29,118
why his lines turned out the way they

1795
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,318
did and why i was having such a hard

1796
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:35,039
time working those lines you know um it

1797
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:37,358
all made sense in the end yeah i mean

1798
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,039
you know i'm not dissing him because

1799
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,358
like you're [ __ ] around the 70s or

1800
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:42,079
80s or even in the 90s or whatever it's

1801
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:44,400
like

1802
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,880
you learn as you go you know you

1803
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,720
bottleneck something when it's early on

1804
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,640
and that's what you got

1805
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:52,639
yeah you know i i'm not dissing him by

1806
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,639
any means because there's a lot like i

1807
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,159
said there's i think his lines are

1808
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:57,759
overly inbred

1809
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,078
yeah but definitely over the umbrella

1810
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,880
but some of the most fireweed at those

1811
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,079
ron parties was out crosses of blue of

1812
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,760
blue work

1813
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,680
yeah so there's nothing wrong with

1814
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,160
having an inbred kind of unique to the

1815
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:12,318
cannabis scene line and it takes some

1816
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,519
outcrossing to really bring out its true

1817
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:15,279
character

1818
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:17,038
no that's kind of what what breeders

1819
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,480
would want something very stable and

1820
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,119
worked you know i don't think that's a

1821
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,480
dis necessary now of course do i wish

1822
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,720
that dj would have repopulated his juicy

1823
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,880
tie and his purple tie and his original

1824
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:31,919
wines every four or five years and kept

1825
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,760
fresh seed of the original things

1826
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,280
yeah sure of course i do do i wish he

1827
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,720
was interested in them and didn't just

1828
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,519
let them go to [ __ ] even though he had

1829
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,318
them

1830
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,159
yeah

1831
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:42,318
well yeah i do

1832
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:43,679
um but you know i mean everybody looks

1833
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,759
back on when they were younger and was

1834
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,440
like boy do i wish i did this

1835
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,520
yeah yeah i mean who doesn't have those

1836
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,880
regrets about their 20s

1837
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:52,880
yeah you know i don't even remember what

1838
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,039
happened in my 20s so right so the

1839
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:58,079
shit's [ __ ] up you know and

1840
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:59,599
so so that's happening um all these kind

1841
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,079
of bible things are happening they're

1842
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,798
all getting documented in that regard

1843
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,240
and eddie leps was another

1844
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:08,719
place that was kind of like ron's

1845
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:11,038
parties or the cannabis parties where

1846
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:13,118
um people overlapped a bunch

1847
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:15,280
yeah because people wanted to come out

1848
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,760
and see this guy is growing a thousand

1849
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:22,000
pounds in his front yard

1850
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,720
yeah holy [ __ ] yeah he's a wild one now

1851
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,159
now it's like it sucks because you know

1852
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,078
uh what happened to him is he ended up

1853
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:30,639
going to jail for 10 him and his wife

1854
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,599
ended up going to jail for 10 years yeah

1855
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,598
um

1856
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,920
and you see gardens way bigger than his

1857
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,680
all over the place now yeah and he

1858
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,920
didn't people should know this he didn't

1859
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,759
just go for it okay

1860
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,519
he did this crazy thing this is probably

1861
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,119
worth mentioning where

1862
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,519
the law said you were allowed to have

1863
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,318
six plants and a ten by ten

1864
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:50,880
yeah

1865
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:52,159
so he mapped out his farm in ten by ten

1866
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,000
grits

1867
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,598
and he collected

1868
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,480
right

1869
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,240
um

1870
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,358
you know he collected medical cards for

1871
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:02,318
each grid

1872
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:04,400
yeah and each medical card was tied to a

1873
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:07,038
specific grid

1874
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,318
yeah and you could give him

1875
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,680
your strains to grow in that grid

1876
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:13,358
and he would do a certain amount of work

1877
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:14,639
like feed it and water it and this and

1878
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:17,440
that but like you could come out there

1879
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:19,199
and do your own de-leafing and your own

1880
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,039
various aspect of different things like

1881
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,960
that you could put in more work

1882
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,799
yeah if you wanted to and really make

1883
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,000
your 10 by 10 nice and then there was i

1884
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:27,599
don't need to get into that part of it

1885
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,480
but there was a split between him and

1886
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,880
you

1887
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,400
yeah you know so honestly it's like he

1888
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,599
didn't just like blow it up and go for

1889
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,798
it

1890
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:38,640
he literally had 10 by 10 plots with six

1891
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:40,159
plants per plot

1892
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,159
tied to a medical card and he would just

1893
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:44,239
stack hundreds of them yeah he was just

1894
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:45,440
challenging the government to challenge

1895
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,000
their own

1896
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,760
like little uh gray areas of the law

1897
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,760
that's what he was doing pretty punk

1898
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,160
rock i might say yeah super punk rock

1899
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,319
super rebellious and he wanted to have

1900
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:58,078
eddie left gardens all up and down the

1901
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:00,239
[ __ ] the highway

1902
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,318
yeah he literally felt like most people

1903
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:04,000
wouldn't be able to grow their own

1904
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:05,838
but why couldn't you come

1905
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,039
bring your medical card to eddie left

1906
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:09,599
collective

1907
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,200
yeah and grow your own fairly near your

1908
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,720
house where you could go 10 to your

1909
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:15,519
plants on the weekend

1910
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,719
yeah you know and what happened to him

1911
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,480
was he

1912
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:19,679
he had this huge plot in his front yard

1913
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,358
i'm not going to dig him out i got some

1914
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,279
posters from him and a bunch of pictures

1915
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:24,400
and stuff but it's too hard to show like

1916
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,359
on the thing

1917
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:30,079
um but anyway he

1918
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:32,078
and then the the last year he had

1919
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,000
he decided to get seven acres across

1920
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:36,400
highway 20 from his house in upper lake

1921
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,880
and he was going to grow about 13 acres

1922
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,920
of cannabis

1923
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,798
yeah dead serious 32 000 plants yeah

1924
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,480
that's a lot for the time yeah uh 32 000

1925
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:47,920
plants all

1926
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,400
documented

1927
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,480
right yeah all with all with and i

1928
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,318
begged him not to

1929
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,000
yeah because i was like dude i don't

1930
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:58,318
think the dea i don't think i don't

1931
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,159
think they'll let you get away with it

1932
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,000
like i'm worried like they'll come down

1933
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,118
and they'll bring the hammer down you

1934
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,798
know

1935
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,798
yeah some photos of that are in the can

1936
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,880
of bible 100 there's a whole thing on

1937
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:10,880
eddie in the can of bible actually yeah

1938
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,480
um you know and and there's definitely

1939
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,160
pictures throughout the can of bibles

1940
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,159
that are from eddie's spot

1941
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:19,358
uh you probably won't recognize them if

1942
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:21,118
you hadn't been there but anyway um

1943
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:22,558
so i begged him not to do it uh some

1944
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,079
other friends begged him not to do it

1945
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,280
but there was other people that thought

1946
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,880
he'd be fired and they were really

1947
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,519
pushing their boundaries

1948
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:32,480
yeah they were pushing it hard

1949
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:33,519
um and uh you know he got raided by the

1950
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,240
dea

1951
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:37,440
it cost him a lot with 32 000 plants you

1952
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,118
know and he

1953
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,559
he him and his wife got 10-year

1954
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,318
sentences

1955
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,480
yeah uh 10-year federal federal

1956
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:46,480
sentences and the [ __ ] the the shitty

1957
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,719
thing about federal sentences is that

1958
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,318
you have to serve 85 of the time it's

1959
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,078
not like the state where you can get off

1960
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:54,079
halfway for good behavior

1961
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,519
yeah and him he was a vietnam vet and

1962
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,599
him and his wife were older his wife

1963
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:01,119
passed away in prison sadly

1964
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:03,440
yeah um and then he got out and uh

1965
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,440
you know the world had changed

1966
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,440
he went from being this like rebel

1967
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,039
maverick kind of center of attention

1968
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,960
which to be honest he was kind of

1969
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,359
egotistical and he had you know he tried

1970
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,400
to form a cannabis church and

1971
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:15,598

2006
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,560
being himself

by dealing with people you know yeah i

2134
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,360
think the same thing happened uh to sam

2135
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:37,439
skunk man

2136
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,519
to some degree oh yeah yeah you know uh

2137
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:41,678
he was probably nicer and more chill and

2138
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,760
then you get you have to answer the same

2139
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,679
50 questions a billion times and you get

2140
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,960
accused of all this [ __ ]

2141
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,960
and all of a sudden you're a

2142
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,960
cantankerous old man

2143
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,480
yeah it's very easy to fall in that

2144
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,480
category

2145
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,399
you know but those guys were all legends

2146
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:57,599
all heroes to us vic

2147
01:12:56,399 --> 01:12:58,719
tom hill

2148
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,800
hempy

2149
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,520
you know uh these were all like leaders

2150
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,119
of the scene you know um and and

2151
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,199
old-timers to us

2152
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:10,719
yeah you know tom's got to be i mean

2153
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:14,719
tom's got to be 20 years older than me

2154
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:16,239
i i don't know maybe maybe i don't maybe

2155
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,560
50s

2156
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:20,238
you think he's only in his 50s yeah i

2157
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,600
think i think you're pretty old actually

2158
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:23,439
i think you're probably older than him

2159
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,640
you're in your 60

2160
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:29,519
yeah you know it's all the oil of olay

2161
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,039
yeah you know it keeps keeps me young

2162
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,640
or whatever but

2163
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,760
the reason why i'm babbling about all

2164
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,800
this [ __ ]

2165
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,640
is

2166
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,480
it's where a lot of people because there

2167
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,760
was essentially like there was

2168
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:41,439
essentially like

2169
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,119
uh

2170
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,879
what's the best way to put it maybe the

2171
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:48,238
best way to put it is that

2172
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,640
in the 90s most weed scenes were

2173
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:52,879
very isolated to themselves

2174
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,880
to very small circles it was very risky

2175
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,400
it was illegal everywhere no one was

2176
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,960
really chatting

2177
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,719
the grateful dead dead tour fish tour

2178
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,640
that kind of thing there was some

2179
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,119
overlapping things because people would

2180
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,880
meet and not be as scared because nobody

2181
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:07,920
knew where anybody else lived

2182
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,079
yeah

2183
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:14,000
no i'm not dude i'm 45. matt's joking

2184
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:16,640
nice 60. he's lying i'm 40 i'm 45 no i'm

2185
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,238

2186
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,600
um

2187
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:21,359
you know but

2188
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,079
but you know i mean and i'll say the

2189
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,839
same thing too because i just saw uh my

2190
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,479

2191

01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,718
all these legendary people and strains

2195
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:38,399
and [ __ ] and i'm like just hoping to get

2196
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,079
hooked up you know

2197
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:41,759
and not to be a dick but like i felt

2198
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:43,439
like i had the chem dog and i had the

2199
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,039
super skunk and i had the mento i felt

2200
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:47,119
like i had the best weed there

2201
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,560
yeah i was like i had me that tore

2202
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:50,238
people's head off

2203
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,880
yeah you know

2204
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:54,319
and and uh you know it's not to be

2205
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,679
bragging or anything like that because

2206
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:57,519
it was literally just the luck of the

2207
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,560
draw and the luck of my friends

2208
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,159
yeah

2209
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,480
you know um

2210
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:03,839
and uh and dead tour you know was one of

2211
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:05,198
those things where

2212
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,119
um

2213
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:08,238
it was it was sort of like a huge weed

2214
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:09,760
emporium

2215
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:10,879
yeah and it made a lot of these

2216
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,480
connections

2217
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,920
and it made a lot of these things that i

2218
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:15,599
tied in and the whole reason i came out

2219
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,079
to mendocino county

2220
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,800
um was because i had a buddy who lived

2221
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:23,359
in ukaya which is in the heart of mendo

2222
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,719
um who after 2 15 past was like dude get

2223
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:25,759
the [ __ ] out here why are you living in

2224
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,439
chicago

2225
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,800
yeah so it was literally connections

2226
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,399
from dead to her that like brought me

2227
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,440
out here right

2228
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:33,039
so

2229
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,319
getting back to what i was saying is

2230
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:37,840
that

2231
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:39,759
in northern california and in dead shows

2232
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,920
there was a weed scene

2233
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,800
and on the forums it developed a weed

2234
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,480
scene

2235
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,719
and in the emerald triangle there was

2236
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:49,119
kind of a weed scene right

2237
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:51,039
and then these parties and these events

2238
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,399
and stuff was sort of like the first

2239
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:54,158
mixers

2240
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:57,439
yeah they were the first places where

2241
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:59,279
these scenes started to like overlap

2242
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:00,879
where the forum scene and the mendo and

2243
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:02,319
humboldt scenes and the grateful dead

2244
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,079
scenes and all these different groups

2245
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:06,238
that have ties to different circles they

2246
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:07,920
start like a venn diagram the circles

2247
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:09,839
start crossing

2248
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,679
yeah and i honestly think that's set up

2249
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,119
kind of everything for the american weed

2250
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,520
scene for later

2251
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:16,960
i think so i really do like none of us

2252
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,800
knew it at the time

2253
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,880
no by any means it wasn't like we're

2254
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,520
like oh we're here for history you know

2255
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,119
it was just it but it did it was it was

2256
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,040
the merging of things i mean i should

2257
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:28,960
say even back then this was a few years

2258
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:30,479
after ron's parties but

2259
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,158
like um

2260
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:34,079
you know i mentioned the purple effects

2261
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:35,359
that's in the uh that's in the can of

2262
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:36,719
bible

2263
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:37,920
maybe i should talk about that for a

2264
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,439
second because people might be

2265
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,679
interested in that

2266
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:44,319
um the purple the purple part of purple

2267
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:47,679
effects is just mendo perks right yes

2268
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:51,198
and the effects was this old garlic bud

2269
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:54,000
strain that i got from uh the head

2270
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:56,319
grower who worked for tim blake

2271
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,119
yeah now tim blake now is very famous

2272
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:01,198
because he's the founder of emerald cup

2273
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:05,119
but back then he was just a big

2274
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:07,678
uh gorilla outdoor indoor uh farmer

2275
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,920
yeah and his his main worker was about

2276
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,679
my age they had the purple effects and

2277
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,199
they gave me the effects which was a

2278
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:17,440
super golden

2279
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:18,559
gorgeous frosty terpe thing right yeah

2280
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,319
and uh

2281
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,880
you know there wasn't any reversals but

2282
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:23,920
how the the purple effects got made

2283
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,119
um

2284
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,399
in the can of bible is that i had a

2285
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:30,000
system that got a little stressed

2286
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:31,439
because i had an air conditioner issue

2287
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,479
and it took me a few days to get it

2288
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,359
fixed

2289
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:36,959
and you know as as csi will tell you you

2290
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,519
stress the mendo perps and the [ __ ]

2291
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,840

2297
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:55,760
reason we got that many was because we

2298
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,400
had like these six or seven you know

2299
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,239
quarter pound six ounce you know effects

2300
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,679
plants all around it

2301
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:03,359
that we couldn't sell

2302
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,880
yeah they were chock full of [ __ ]

2303
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,119
seed

2304
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,279
but we cracked this thing and it ends up

2305
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:10,479
being super turpy

2306
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:12,158
um

2307
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:14,238
you know and all that and it ended up in

2308
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:16,559
the can of bibles gorgeous weed

2309
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:18,000
um and you know i should say that

2310
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,640
there's been some battles amongst the

2311
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,640
crew we'll talk about that too but um

2312
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,400
some of that weed exists still i don't

2313
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,480
have it i lost it in a bust but some of

2314
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:29,039
that weed exists still and it's in

2315
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:30,879
um it's in the rose

2316
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,679
it's in the sprite

2317
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:36,159
um it got passed around at some of tim

2318
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,000
blake's early and you know people should

2319
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:40,960
know that tim blake had this spot called

2320
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,880
area 101 in north of leightonville right

2321
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,840
yeah and he threw a bunch of weed events

2322
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:48,000
up there and he threw um a bunch of like

2323
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,279
essentially like weird raves and

2324
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,198
different kinds of like musical

2325
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:53,439
gatherings and and all that kind of

2326
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:55,519
stuff and it was kind of like a scene

2327
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,439
and you know the first half a dozen

2328
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,800
emerald cups

2329
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:01,678
were all super local events held there

2330
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,520
yeah

2331
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,960
um and so i passed out a bunch of seed

2332
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,320
there was a gentleman that used to work

2333
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,960
up there and used to work at reggae a

2334
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:10,960
bunch called fuzzy um that's not his

2335
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,960
real name but that's his nickname

2336
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,960
and uh

2337
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,800
you know and all that and stuff and so

2338
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,198
you know he ended up getting the purple

2339
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,199
effects from me and and that's who the

2340
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:23,439
you know tony mendo and those guys got

2341
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:25,119
it from yeah and it got blended into

2342
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,639
skittles and it got got all these

2343
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:28,238
different things you know and it it

2344
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,400
lives today

2345
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:32,399
yeah you know uh now but that was a

2346
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:34,960
total that was before femmes

2347
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:37,679
that was literally an unintentional

2348
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,359
[ __ ] up uh where in summer time the ac

2349
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:41,440
went out for two days

2350
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:42,960
yeah and you know it got hopped and then

2351
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:44,960
i put a new ac in and everything was

2352
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,399
good and then the mendo p just threw

2353
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,840
through pollen

2354
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:51,439
yeah and i had a and i had a feminized

2355
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,760
cross um people are asking what about

2356
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:55,678
california black rose as far as i know

2357
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,679
it's the same thing same thing um yeah

2358
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,158
so what happened to them

2359
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:02,719
is like a lot of cannabis terms

2360
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:06,000
uh rose is trademarked

2361
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:08,158
yep rose is a very specific kind of wine

2362
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and there's also another seed company

2363
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:12,158
that has a totally different line called

2364
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,158
rose as well relentless and that's not

2365
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:15,679
related to i don't think it's related to

2366
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:16,960
the same dime greek one but uh don't

2367
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,880
quote me now that i think about i don't

2368
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,039
know

2369
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,600
so they had to change it because they

2370
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,039
got because as you get legal and you

2371
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,639
start entering these things and stuff

2372
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,399
you start getting sued

2373
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,560
yeah you know girl scout cookies and

2374
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:32,479
thin mint is cookies because they got

2375
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,880
[ __ ] sued by the girl scouts

2376
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,479
yeah you know the reason why skittles

2377
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,239
has z's

2378
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,718
yeah you know is they're trying to skate

2379
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:42,238
around these these trademark laws right

2380
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,039
so

2381
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:48,238
rosay is russian og

2382
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:51,760
crossed with skittles that's the z

2383
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:53,839
across the purple effects that's the e

2384
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,199
and it took second place i don't know

2385
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,400
three four years ago or whatever at the

2386
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:58,799
emerald coast

2387
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,319
so what i got out of them and and this

2388
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,960
this one's been i think i have a

2389
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:03,840
screenshot of it it was russian kush oz

2390
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,158
kush

2391
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,560
effects cross back to skittles is the

2392
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:09,839
claim yeah something like yeah yeah so

2393
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,920
it's something close about that but they

2394
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,159
had the the seeds that they had were

2395
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,199
purple effect seeds from from fuzzy that

2396
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:17,039
was from me

2397
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,158
yeah because back then it was like there

2398
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:21,600
wasn't any

2399
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:23,759
i mean in this same time frame um i

2400
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,199
should say this too but you know uh my

2401
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,400
buddy from uh

2402
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:30,879
me and and uh uh skunk va's old friend

2403
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:32,879
who um with the chems and stuff we were

2404
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,800
working on these superdog projects

2405
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,880
together and crossing them to all kinds

2406
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,079
of different hybrids and and clone only

2407
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,560
as we had

2408
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,719
um and my buddy mandelbrot

2409
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,800
uh at the time who wasn't into seeds or

2410
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,319
breeding wanted to get started with weed

2411
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,719
and i ended up giving him a bunch of

2412
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:50,399
seeds and a bun and some clones to get

2413
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,239
him started on this project and he ended

2414
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:54,319
up becoming pretty well known

2415
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:56,158
um some of the stuff he got famous for

2416
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:58,079
was based off that work some of it was a

2417
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:00,319
little different from different things

2418
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,000
yeah um but the

2419
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:04,559
the reason i brought that up isn't to

2420
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,719
like lay claim it's to say that back

2421
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,840
then we were very free with trading

2422
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,600
things

2423
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,880
yeah because no one ever thought that

2424
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,280
they could come out of the woodwork and

2425
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,319
lay claim to anything yeah

2426
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:16,238
yeah right

2427
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:18,000
yeah that wasn't worried

2428
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:20,718
now it's all like [ __ ] you you can't

2429
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,039
breed with my my cut that's mine that's

2430
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,399
my seed line i want matt knows this more

2431
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,479
than me because

2432
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,238
um i i've avoided so far a lot of the

2433
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:29,839
weed politics by giving away a bunch of

2434
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:32,559
seeds for free

2435
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,360
yeah and when you sell seeds like matt

2436
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,360
uh you end up getting you know i want

2437
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:38,719
half the seeds because you use my cut in

2438
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:41,519
this one cross

2439
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:43,198
i want rep i want you to mention me i

2440
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,560
want you to give me money

2441
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:47,279
uh it's my [ __ ] you don't have

2442
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,800
permission jobs i have so many [ __ ]

2443
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:50,000
i've had to give just because of seats

2444
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,159
it's not fair

2445
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,319
not fair yeah it's not you know i mean

2446
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:56,079
do what you love do what you love so

2447
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:57,679
that's what i'm good at so yeah yeah i

2448
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:59,920
mean so there you know there's an aspect

2449
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:01,440
of politics but this was before that

2450
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,359
politics

2451
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,759
yeah people just swapped seeds people

2452
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,000
just swapped you know people just

2453
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,079
swapped cuttings people swapped you know

2454
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,439
all this different stuff it wasn't like

2455
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:13,119
you know you didn't want your name

2456
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:14,638
attached to weed

2457
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:16,238
yeah because then they'd [ __ ] find

the time there was no

2484
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:11,519
at the time there was no

2485
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,159
i mean people should give credit you

2486
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,600
know i mean i just saw uh homie

2487
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:16,799
mentioned that people should give credit

2488
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,039
you should say

2489
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:22,079
that i got this from this person you

2490
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:24,479
know you also should um if you got a cut

2491
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:26,000
from somebody um you should give it back

2492
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:27,599
to them if they lose it

2493
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
yeah that's really good etiquette you

2494
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,280
know um i've had multiple things that

2495
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,119
i've lost

2496
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,960
and i've tried to get back from people i

2497
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:36,800
i mentioned the purple effects that's

2498
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,359
one of them it exists i can't get it

2499
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:42,400
back without trading other things for it

2500
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:45,119
yeah which i think is uh super shady and

2501
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:46,638
a breach of the code at least the code

2502
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:48,880
when i came up

2503
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:50,639
um you're definitely supposed to

2504
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,719
do that there's some honor i mean half

2505
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,400
the reason people trade things is so you

2506
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,719
don't lose things

2507
01:24:54,399 --> 01:25:00,000
yeah because angry girlfriend angry

2508
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:01,119
boyfriend bust fire landlord moving

2509
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,079
accident

2510
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:03,039
whatever

2511
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:05,039
you know

2512
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,479
all those different types of things

2513
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:08,719
um

2514
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:10,479
you know you trade things back amongst

2515
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,079
people you know yeah i mean one of the

2516
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:13,599
reasons you know i'll say this because

2517
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:15,600
he's because he's listening or whatever

2518
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,159
but i mean one of the reasons why the

2519
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,480
chem 91 didn't get lost

2520
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:23,759
yeah was because there was a tight group

2521
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:26,238
of uh you know four or five of us myself

2522
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,079
uh skunk va i see collective my buddy

2523
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:30,238
from staten island who all had it and

2524
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:33,760
all lived in norcal

2525
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:35,439
and you know we all kept it alive

2526
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,039
you know people sometimes people got in

2527
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:38,399
trouble some people had to move

2528
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:40,719
sometimes you had to get back from

2529
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:43,039
somebody or whatever and it was like we

2530
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:46,079
were all heavily invested

2531
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:48,238
in making sure these things lived

2532
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:50,000
you know yeah i mean that's that's why a

2533
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:51,599
lot of these cuts are still in our group

2534
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,479

2648
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,359
end at the end of the day than the money

2649

semi-autistic weed nerds in some way or

2659
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:00,080
whatever you know and like you it's odd

01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:04,319
you know living amongst uh you know

2662

small groups of people

2663
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:08,799
and living weed and taking a bunch of

2664
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:12,079
risks and staying secret for a long time

2665
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:13,039
like me showing my face is [ __ ] nuts

2666
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:15,198

2669
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,000
you know and

2670
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:21,679
you know so i just i just thought it

2671
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,359
would be it would be cool because this

2672
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:25,600
era is like right before kind of matt

2673
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:27,599
came into things yeah

2674
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,719
which is like i apologize because i keep

2675
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,280
trying to get

2676
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:33,198
uh shows done where i make it like more

2677
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:35,759
matt's era than mine

2678
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:38,479
um because there's my arrows were

2679
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,760
smaller they had an arrow there's an era

2680
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:41,519
where like you know i was having a bunch

2681
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,159
of kids and had some issues or whatever

2682
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,560
and

2683
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:46,638
and matt was super engaged

2684
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,800
uh when i was a little less engaged but

2685
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:51,119
so far i you know i'm gonna drag him

2686
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:53,039
kicking and screaming into his era

2687
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:54,719
where it's mostly him talking and me

2688
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,560
shutting up but he keeps making us do

2689
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,760
these things where it's it's a little

2690
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,800
older

2691
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,800
stuff

2692
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,560
yeah i think i think it's a lot too

2693
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,480
because i've been you know doing the

2694
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,840
live feed for a long time and i think

2695
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:07,759
for

2696
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,440
this many years i think people are more

2697
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,320
excited to hear from someone else for a

2698
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:14,238
bit and i i'm excited to hear like from

2699
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:16,238
an era i wasn't a part of and i think

2700
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:17,759
nobody gives a [ __ ] to hear what i have

2701
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:19,599
to say about something i wasn't a part

2702
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,079
of and i don't either so i think it's

2703
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,760
it's it's not just about my ego on this

2704
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:25,679
thing i think it's good to to get all

2705
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,520
aspects of history on here and you know

2706
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,399
there's a thing too where it's like i

2707
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:32,639
mean we didn't know back in the day that

2708
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:33,679
the chem dog was gonna become super

2709
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,719
famous

2710
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:38,639
uh yeah it stayed alive um because our

2711
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,079
buddy from staten island used to take it

2712
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:42,079
to

2713
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:43,679
like you could meet him outside of any

2714
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:45,840
jerry show outside the warfield and

2715
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:49,199
probably buy a 400 ounce

2716
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,000
yeah you know um you know all that you

2717
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:51,599
could

2718
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,479
uh you know

2719
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,360
um

2720
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:58,319
when's when jerry garcia died you know

2721
01:31:55,359 --> 01:32:00,559
um and he decided to and and you know

2722
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:02,238
skunk va came back to california you

2723
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,520
know he got cuts from homie and he

2724
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:05,359
started he started growing because all

2725
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,360
of a sudden he was settled down

2726
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:08,399
he wasn't traveling and seeing shows and

2727
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:10,238
stuff and that's where some of his

2728
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:11,119
polaroids come from of that old skunk

2729
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:13,279
cut

2730
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:15,039
you know and you know small group of us

2731
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:16,479
were growing the dog and we were always

2732
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:18,880
we called it you know no one called the

2733
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:21,119
chem 91 and all that that's all like

2734
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,920
later we all called it the dog

2735
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:24,559
yeah

2736
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:26,560
and you know uh skunk va and our buddy

2737
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,760
from staten island they mostly grew

2738
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,120
organic

2739
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,239
so they didn't want to call their weed

2740
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:32,158
chem

2741
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:33,198
yeah and we're going to call it the chem

2742
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:34,960
dog

2743
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:37,439
i think that picture i think that

2744
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,039
picture the super skunk for me at least

2745
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:40,638
and what i'm interested in is one of the

2746
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,158
most important pictures that anybody

2747
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,000
could have kept that and some of the

2748
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:46,158
josh dog pictures

2749
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,639
um yeah those are specifically the sour

2750
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:51,359
picture and or pictures of sauer

2751
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:53,119
pictures the old super skunk super super

2752
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:56,158
[ __ ] important for solving that weird

2753
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:58,238
mystery of like was this super skunk cut

2754
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:00,319
the same as the original super skunk cut

2755
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:03,359
that was hard to that was hard to figure

2756
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:04,880
out yeah and uh that helped a lot i mean

2757
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,039
there's a thing too like part of the you

2758
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,480
know we don't need to go over it again

2759
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:10,639
um but we'll talk about it just really

2760
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:12,959
briefly we were talking about like ron's

2761
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:15,199
parties and these and the triangle and

2762
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,679
the dead scene and all that i mean the

2763
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:20,000
whole reason that the francine

2764
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:22,560
um got taken out east and you know the

2765
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,198
super skunk came west and all that stuff

2766
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:28,000
was all because of jerry shows

2767
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:29,198
yeah that our friend and and skunk va

2768
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,198
were at

2769
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:33,599
and friends of his from back east and

2770
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,359
smoking weed together at the show and

2771
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,880
then people wanting that stuff and so i

2772
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,719
don't need to you know i wasn't there i

2773
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,400
don't need to tell that part it's you

2774
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,000
know that's that's he's told that story

2775
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:42,719
pretty eloquently and stuff like that

2776
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,039
but

2777
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:46,319
it is it is showing how those circles

2778
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:48,079
overlapped

2779
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:50,238

2788
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:04,479
we're gonna

2789
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,239
chat again this weekend i have a i have

2790
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:08,000
a line on something i thought was long

2791
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:10,319
lost that's dear to both of our hearts

2792
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,319
so i'm trying my damnedest to make sure

2793
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:13,519
i can get it back to all of us uh yeah

2794
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:15,279
but we'll see

2795
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:18,480
you know and i do believe

2796
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:20,000
i'm not particularly uh

2797
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:22,000
superstitious

2798
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,079
um yeah but i do believe in in the

2799
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,760
energy of the plant and i do believe in

2800
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:26,800
the universe a bit like making things

2801
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,520
come to you

2802
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,760
and i can say for everyone out there

2803
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,520
uh for me at least the number one way

2804
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,960
that you get the cuts that you want and

2805
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,000
you get the things that you want in

2806
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,760
cannabis

2807
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,679
is by treating the plant the right way

2808
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,199
and having the right intentions

2809
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,039
yeah

2810
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:44,559
that's what i say because that that's

2811
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:46,560
going to long term that's going to get

2812
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,159
the right people to trust you

2813
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,080
yep and that's going to lead to what you

2814
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:51,198
want and i do believe the plant has an

2815
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:53,600
energy

2816
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:54,719
and i do believe the plant wants to uh

2817
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,639
wants to

2818
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,480
um you know

2819
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,600
wants to find people that'll keep it

2820
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:02,079
safe

2821
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,480
i agree i really do i don't know there's

2822
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:06,000
not i can't prove it obviously but i

2823
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:08,718
believe that there's collectors out

2824
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,800
there and the plant hides

2825
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:12,560
yeah in places where it's hoping that

2826
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,800
someone cares about it and isn't just

2827
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,719
monetarily attached to it

2828
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,279
yeah but loves it

2829
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,239
you know and a lot of the things that i

2830
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:22,319
have

2831
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:23,759
um i wouldn't have because i would have

2832
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:25,198
gotten rid of them as soon as they were

2833
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,079
unpopular

2834
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:28,238
yeah

2835
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:29,359
but i personally liked them and cared

2836
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:31,039
about them

2837
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:32,559
and then there's friends of mine that

2838
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:34,079
feel the same way and that's why they

2839
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,039
have their [ __ ]

2840
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:37,840
you know

2841
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:40,000
yeah and so it's it's a general point

2842
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,760
among our friends yeah it's a theme you

2843
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,158
know and if you get it's like you get

2844
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,760
trusted in circles and you know maybe we

2845
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:47,920
can go into this there's an aspect of

2846
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,679
like authenticity that we were going to

2847
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,960
talk about before right because we are

2848
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,399
kind of getting an hour and a half into

2849
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,840
it so maybe we can talk a little bit

2850
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:56,479
about this and there's

2851
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:59,119
there's aspects of things where now that

2852
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:01,118
i'm being public okay and i'm starting

2853
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:02,000
to tell some of these stories

2854
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:03,519
um

2855
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,600
i should say that there's a lot of

2856
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,199
things that maybe like five or ten

2857
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,320
percent of the weed community knows

2858
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:10,719
pretty well

2859
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:13,039
yeah um that becomes difficult where how

2860
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:15,279
do you let the other 90 know

2861
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:17,198
yeah so there's a lot of like accepted

2862
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:19,599
facts among small groups of people that

2863
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:21,439
want to trade this kind of information

2864
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,400
right sure and then you want to get it

2865
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:24,399
out there

2866
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,559
and you get [ __ ] attacked

2867
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:28,319
yeah and so you know matt can attest

2868
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,320
that he tried to get me to do this for a

2869
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:31,198
long ass time and i wouldn't

2870
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:33,359
yeah

2871
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:34,638
right i mean well i mean you were just

2872
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,198
watching what happened to me and you're

2873
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:39,359
like [ __ ] that i don't want that in my

2874
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:42,799
life i was also like showing i mean i

2875
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:43,679
did i did caleb's event up in uh upbeat

2876
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,880
that's right

2877
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,440
you know and it was like i showed my

2878
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,520
face i was in front of a huge crowd

2879
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:51,519
yeah you know of people and i was just

2880
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,440
like oh my god you know i mean i didn't

2881
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,960
give my real name but it's still at the

2882
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:56,319
time it was difficult

2883
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,800
yeah but

2884
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,639
what it comes down to is that if

2885
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,440
what convinced me to do it

2886
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:04,880
is is like if you don't try to get some

2887
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:06,638
version of the truth out there or what

2888
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,159
you believe to be the truth

2889
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:09,199
and it's just going to be overwhelmed by

2890
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:11,839
[ __ ]

2891
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:13,519
yeah right and there's an aspect where

2892
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,800
it's like and i really get upset about

2893
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:17,199
it sometimes

2894
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:19,039
where there's this ig thing where people

2895
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:22,238
pile on each other

2896
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:23,439
yeah okay and you know matt's a villain

2897
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:25,919
on ig

2898
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:27,359
yes i want to be to a lot of but to a

2899
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,480
lot of people that don't know him in

2900
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:30,719
real life

2901
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:32,718
yeah you know and if we want to fast

2902
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:34,960
forward a bit before kovid

2903
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:36,399
um matt and i

2904
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,319
there was other friends that helped and

2905
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:40,479
stuff like that so i'm not trying to

2906
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:42,479
just to diss anyone i'm not mentioning

2907
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:43,599
but matt and i and a few other friends

2908
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:45,678
kind of like

2909
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,239
uh got this idea to throw what we called

2910
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:50,880
like the can illuminati party yeah and

2911
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:52,319
it was sort of kind of based on ron's

2912
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:54,639
old parties and some of those old

2913
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:58,079
gatherings but more modern yeah and we

2914
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:59,920
decided to do it the same weekend as

2915
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:03,118
emerald cup

2916
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:05,199
you know because um

2917
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:08,079
everybody would be in town

2918
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:10,638
yeah so we rented a huge house

2919
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:13,359
and invited a bunch of people over

2920
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,880
on friday and saturday night of emerald

2921
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:16,639
cup

2922
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,880
and both years you know we had hundreds

2923
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:21,760
of people come through the house

2924
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:23,118
yeah right and believe it or not nobody

2925
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,360
punched matt

2926
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:27,039
no what do you know nobody attacked matt

2927
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:29,359
there's a lot of people that you that

2928
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:30,719
you don't imagine that like respect them

2929
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:31,920
a whole bunch

2930
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,000
yeah i don't know about that but they

2931
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:36,000
didn't punch me yeah you know you have a

2932
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,520
lot a lot of friends you know there's a

2933
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,760
lot of friends you get a bunch of

2934
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,280
collectors and breeders and weed nerds

2935
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,639
and people in the industry that come

2936
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:44,559
through and want to hang out with each

2937
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:45,840
other and you got to realize that like

2938
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,679
we were trying to throw an event where

2939
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,679
it's like those guys spend all day at

2940
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:52,079
their [ __ ] booth

2941
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,359

forums there was a bunch of friends i

2976
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:55,839
made on ig

2977
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:57,279

they might hear you talk about it but

2983
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:09,039
they don't actually see your wheat

2984
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:10,800
yeah

2985
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:12,158
you know and then they get a chance to

2986
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,600
do it then you get to share a bunch of

2987
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:14,879
your weed with friends and you get to do

2988
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,719
all these different kinds of things you

2989
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,960

2990
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:20,639

a who's who of people that have been

2997
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,639
around for a long time and you would not

2998
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,280
believe

2999
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:36,079
how little beef there is

3000
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:37,759
yeah there was none any person there

3001
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:39,840

3002
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,480
friends it was smoking out eating a

3003
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:45,279
bunch of food having a great time you

3004
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:48,000

3005
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:48,880
connections putting faces to names right

3006
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,800
yeah

3007
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,560
all that different types of stuff

3008
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,719
right and so

3009
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,320
you have an aspect where

3010
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,600
we've had some issues this week where

3011
01:40:56,319 --> 01:40:59,759
you know you start having these talks

3012
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,239
week by week and like i said matt's a

3013
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:04,000
bit of a villain online and because now

3014
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:05,759
i'm coming out and we haven't even hit

3015
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,279
some of the controversial topics yet but

3016
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,239
as i'm coming out and talking about

3017
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:11,679
stuff

3018
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:12,959
um you start getting enemies

3019
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,279
you start getting people that are

3020
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:18,000
annoyed that people are listening to you

3021
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:21,198
or don't believe your version of events

3022
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,800
or you know on ig or on various discords

3023
01:41:21,198 --> 01:41:24,879
they want to like disparage your

3024
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,679
character and say you weren't around and

3025
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,199
say

3026
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:29,600
that you didn't have anything or your

3027
01:41:27,198 --> 01:41:30,638
weed was [ __ ] or your seeds suck or

3028
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,280
whatever

3029
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:35,279
and honestly like it becomes really hard

3030
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,639
because a lot of people that are

3031
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:38,319
listening

3032
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:39,760
you don't know the person you're siding

3033
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:41,599
with and you don't know the person that

3034
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,639
you're against in real life

3035
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,719
yeah

3036
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:47,920
like in an honest real life

3037
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:49,198
yeah no you know so it becomes hard how

3038
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,199
do you choose

3039
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:52,638
you know how do you make stuff happen i

3040
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:54,638
mean there was people that were accusing

3041
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,000
me this week of not even see the chems

3042
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:57,118
until oh eight

3043
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,960
yeah

3044
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:01,039
you know and then i came out of nowhere

3045
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,920
and that all my stories are lies and not

3046
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:06,719
so it just means the stories are not so

3047
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,480
and let's let's be fair though like

3048
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:11,039
the the people that were doing this were

3049
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:12,879
people that were in the outer circle of

3050
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:14,960
our friend group and never made it quite

3051
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:16,159
on the in circle because they were

3052
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:18,079
they were bad people and they [ __ ]

3053
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:20,000
people over or they did certain things

3054
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:21,760
people haven't actually been bad

3055
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,840
yeah you know and that's my point right

3056
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,760
so matt will come out and say

3057
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,520
this person's a scammer he's stealing

3058
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,199
cuts he's trying to [ __ ] you over he's

3059
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,440
trying to take your money

3060
01:42:29,198 --> 01:42:33,759
yeah and then that person and like and

3061
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:35,039
and some bots and like a bunch of fake

3062
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:37,039
accounts and a bunch of people that

3063
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:39,198
bought seeds all attacked matt

3064
01:42:37,039 --> 01:42:43,719
yeah you know he's a [ __ ] he's a jew

3065
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:43,719
he's fat he's this he is

3066
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,080
all these various things they're getting

3067
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,440
attacked and so as i become a public

3068
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,359
figure a little bit like they start

3069
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:53,439
attacking oh is that that party is weed

3070
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:55,118
sucks this and that everything else and

3071
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:57,759
that's fine people to throw barbs that's

3072
01:42:55,118 --> 01:42:59,279
part of it yeah right and i'm not even

3073
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,199
saying you should trust me

3074
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:04,158
but what i am saying is that

3075
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,759
you know weed as a a lot of people lived

3076
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:07,519
in the shadows

3077
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,960
yeah and it's not documented and the

3078
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:12,080
reason why we're doing a bunch of these

3079
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:13,760
stories is because we want to get oral

3080
01:43:12,079 --> 01:43:15,439
history out there and we want to do it

3081
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,800
in a conversational fashion that doesn't

3082
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:17,839
bore you to death

3083
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,840
yeah

3084
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,520
and we try to do that and then that

3085
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,119
steps on toes and then people are

3086
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,040
furious

3087
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:26,399
and so they they they can't [ __ ] with

3088
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:27,198
the story

3089
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:29,039
right

3090
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:30,158
um but so they'll [ __ ] with matt or

3091
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:32,319
they'll [ __ ] with me or they'll say

3092
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:36,079
you're a liar they say oh i know for a

3093
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:38,079
fact he didn't touch kem until after 08.

3094
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:39,920
or he didn't have this or his this his

3095
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:41,359
headband is watered down or whatever

3096
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:44,319
they want to say about matt it's just

3097
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:45,599
the 707. yeah just just some [ __ ]

3098
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:47,039
and it's like

3099
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,960
you know and it's like you don't want to

3100
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:51,279
spend all your life [ __ ] like

3101
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,520
refuting a bunch of [ __ ]

3102
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:54,719
you know because it's like everybody

3103
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,920

some stuff that matt's doing or you know

3126
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,279
csi or different people at times because

3127
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:40,638
there is a financial element to like

3128
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:44,079
making all these different types of

3129
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:46,239
stuff work right to some degree um but

3130
01:44:44,079 --> 01:44:50,479
really what it is is that now that i'm

01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,119
have to decide because there are some

3137

3202
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:06,158
like a general sense

3203
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:08,000
um because you start calling out

3204
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:09,599
individual people and then the next week

3205
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,238
of my life is [ __ ]

3206
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,119
that [ __ ] trying to defend themselves

3207
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:13,919
yes

3208
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:16,559
and

3209
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:18,719
you know and blowing themselves up

3210
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,960
yeah and me and homie matt and i and me

3211
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:23,520
and skunk we know a lot of history

3212
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:25,760
yeah not all of it is not all of it is

3213
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:28,239
is beneficial to the people

3214
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,679
no unfortunately but then you can't you

3215
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:31,919
know it doesn't pay to spend your whole

3216
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,600
life trying to warn the family

3217
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,800
about no jack off because it's

3218
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,119
whack-a-mole

3219
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:39,760
yeah i tried that i really did and and

3220
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:41,920
it just it did not pay off if it was

3221
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:44,000
detrimental to my career

3222
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,118
i will say i don't recommend people do

3223
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,760
that for

3224
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:50,238
any reason whatsoever if you have a an

3225
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:52,560
interest in being successful

3226
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:53,919
yeah i mean i uh

3227
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,600
so yeah you know i mean there's there's

3228
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,118
that aspect and so i'm not saying trust

3229
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,039
me or trust matt

3230
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:00,719
i'm saying like if you're giving us your

3231
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:02,639
time every friday night you get to talk

3232
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:05,679
to us at length and ask questions and

3233
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:07,840
stuff eventually you have to maybe you

3234
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:09,760
can hear enough of things that you get a

3235
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,880
general sense of who we are

3236
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:16,000
yeah but i will say that ig is an image

3237
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:19,118
and that sociopaths are very very good

3238
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,039
at curating an image yeah

3239
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:22,799
you know what they do best

3240
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:24,079
and um you know and yeah someone just

3241
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,760

people aren't you know um people aren't

3244
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,440
perfect and i'm not even trying to judge

3245
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:33,599
people that's why i'm not calling

3246

01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:10,718
some of the details yeah yeah so because

3265
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:13,440
i don't want it just to be my opinion i

3266
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:15,439
want it to be dude's own words sure no i

3267
01:49:13,439 --> 01:49:16,879
get it yeah so i mean and that's kind of

3268
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:19,839
what we talk about like when people are

3269
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:21,440
like the can illuminati you know yeah

3270
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,520
the candle illuminati is not like some

3271
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:24,960
kind of organization or membership

3272
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,960
there's no do's

3273
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,880
you know there's no one that controls it

3274
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,039
what it basically means

3275
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,960
is that you're enough of a weed head

3276
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:35,519
that you care enough of the history to

3277
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,679
hold on to strains to hold onto seeds to

3278
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:40,400
want to dig for the truth

3279
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:41,760
and you talk to other people like that

3280
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:43,679
and it basically it's a it's a

3281
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,840
like-minded group

3282
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:47,920
of people and we know who each other are

3283
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:50,480
and it's like even amongst that group

3284
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:52,399
there's not even really trading

3285
01:49:50,479 --> 01:49:54,718
no there's just like dude like once you

3286
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:56,158
know it's like uh you know a skunk va

3287
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:57,359
and i were talking earlier today about

3288
01:49:56,158 --> 01:50:00,158
it it's like we're not going to trade

3289
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:02,000
anything no like it's like oh you need a

3290
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:03,519
couple of these and and i can get you

3291
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,599
this or whatever it's it's not like a

3292
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,560
trade it's more just like

3293
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,239
you know

3294
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:10,000
yes this is what i have this is what you

3295
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:11,198
have yeah you know i don't think there's

3296
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,800
anything wrong with trading because

3297
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:14,079
trading is perfectly acceptable

3298
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,679
especially if you don't know each other

3299
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:17,519
but once you've been personal friends

3300
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,840
for a couple of decades

3301
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:22,000
yeah it's just friends helping friends

3302
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:24,400
yeah you know and a lot of the ways that

3303
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,319
this stuff exists like you know our

3304
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:27,519
history that's really why i'm chatting

3305
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:29,279
is because i don't want all of our

3306
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,400
history to be lost

3307
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:32,000
no

3308
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:34,638
i want it to be out there in some kind

3309
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:37,118
of form and it's almost all oral

3310
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:39,199
yeah and with a lot of the forums going

3311
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:41,118
down over the years whether it be from

3312
01:50:39,198 --> 01:50:43,279
the feds you know getting a hold of the

3313
01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:45,920
icmag server to

3314
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:48,479
uh you know can a collective pot pimp

3315
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:50,399
any of the the the seed depot any of

3316
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:53,519
those that have gone down they had a lot

3317
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:55,439
of uh information on them like c depot a

3318
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,920
lot of people that people look at today

3319
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:59,759
as old school heroes and whatnot or

3320
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:02,079
really trustworthy people all popped up

3321
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:04,079
on seed depot and their whole history is

3322
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:05,439
gone because that's that site was gone

3323
01:51:04,079 --> 01:51:08,399
the dude disappeared after [ __ ]

3324
01:51:05,439 --> 01:51:09,598
everyone over that owned it so um that's

3325
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:11,359
gone but it's in a lot of people's

3326
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:13,199
memories so this is really the only

3327
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:14,960
chance we have to put that out there

3328
01:51:13,198 --> 01:51:16,879
yeah and so we're just we're just trying

3329
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:17,840
to we're just trying to like regurgitate

3330
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,279
stuff

3331
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:20,960
and get it out there and get different

3332
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:22,079
versions of things

3333
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,520
yeah you know

3334
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:25,679
um and

3335
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,520
and you know like like anything you know

3336
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,279
some of these stories there's people

3337
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,040
that have different memories

3338
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:32,479
yeah there's people that have different

3339
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:34,639
versions even like the three or four

3340
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:36,319
people that were there might not tell

3341
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:38,400
the same tale

3342
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:39,840
yeah they were the ones that were there

3343
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:41,598
i know i got a nickname for being a

3344
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,679
power bottom at the last party and i'm

3345
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:46,079
pretty sure i was power top

3346
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,760
pretty sure

3347
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:49,198
you know but i mean it's cool because

3348
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,440
then you get then you get you know these

3349
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:53,598
parties these gatherings and stuff they

3350
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:55,279
really are bonding

3351
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:56,880
yeah they really are where human

3352
01:51:55,279 --> 01:51:58,399
connections are made

3353
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,480
you get to smoke a bunch of your good

3354
01:51:58,399 --> 01:52:02,158
friends weed you get to see them in

3355
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:04,638
person you get to hear what their voice

3356
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:06,479
sounds like and and hear them laugh

3357
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:07,599
you get to break bread and food with

3358
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:10,079
people

3359
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:12,159
you know yeah um and you get to share

3360
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:14,238
weed and share experiences and so i

3361
01:52:12,158 --> 01:52:16,238
think that's you know what maybe we can

3362
01:52:14,238 --> 01:52:17,839
get the cantaloupe canned illuminati

3363
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:20,000
parties together again

3364
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,119
uh now that covid seems to be dying down

3365
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,039
and there's lots of people that are

3366
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:25,439
either been infected or vaccinated and

3367
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:27,198
it's not so much like the plague

3368
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:28,719
yeah it was for a few years where it was

3369
01:52:27,198 --> 01:52:29,519
shutting [ __ ] down

3370
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:30,960
yeah

3371
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:32,639
but those kind of gatherings are

3372
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,319
important and so tonight you know we're

3373
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:36,079
almost at two hours so i'll probably

3374
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:37,840
shut up here in a second but

3375
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:40,000
i just wanted to give like a general

3376
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:41,920
random overview of some of the

3377
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,198
overlapping things that were happening

3378
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,039
in that era

3379
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:46,960
yeah it really set the stage for

3380
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:48,479
everything that came after

3381
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:49,920
yeah it was really where a lot of

3382
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:51,678
friendships were made it was where a lot

3383
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,920
of trading and a lot of seed exchange

3384
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:55,279
was done it was where a lot of cuttings

3385
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:58,158
and a lot of people smoking other

3386
01:52:55,279 --> 01:53:00,639
people's weed and learning happened and

3387
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:02,079
then a lot of those guys um ended up

3388
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:03,359
becoming super well known in the

3389
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:04,238
community

3390
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:05,359
yeah

3391
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:09,039
you know

3392
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:10,238
um so you know it it it uh

3393
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:11,599
you know but you don't know it at the

3394
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:13,598
time

3395
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:15,199
no that's that's the funny thing about

3396
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:16,800
history is you don't know if you're if

3397
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:17,839
you're making it you don't know you know

3398
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,679
so

3399
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:21,199
um but really what it boils down to is

3400
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:22,239
we're all just people

3401
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:23,919
some of us

3402
01:53:22,238 --> 01:53:25,678
care about the plant

3403
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:28,239
yeah uh some of us care about rapping

3404
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:29,279
money and and and you know scamming

3405
01:53:28,238 --> 01:53:31,198
people

3406
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:32,399
and there's a big conflict between those

3407
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:34,079
two right now

3408
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:35,679
yeah in the community there's been one

3409
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:37,920
for a long time

3410
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:39,359
yeah but it's gotten more public and i

3411
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,880

you know but but what's funny about that

3427
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,360
is that i can use that later to prove

3428
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,560
something that would like blow them up

3429
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:11,839
in the face

3430
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:14,000
yes

3431
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,800
yeah and i've been pushed enough enough

3432
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,479
times by this human being to

3433
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:20,079
you know just suck it sucks to have to

3434
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:22,319
do it but because

3435
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:23,840
they're saying such extreme [ __ ] like

3436
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:25,279
there's only a few things in life that i

3437
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:28,159
take real personal is when you talk

3438
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:30,238
about a friend's family or you call me a

3439
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:32,399
[ __ ] nazi like

3440
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:34,479
i spent my whole young life this

3441
01:54:32,399 --> 01:54:36,960
literally fist fighting nazis and being

3442
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:38,718
punched by them many many many times so

3443
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:40,960
i i take it very seriously when someone

3444
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:42,480
accuses me of such things so yeah and

3445
