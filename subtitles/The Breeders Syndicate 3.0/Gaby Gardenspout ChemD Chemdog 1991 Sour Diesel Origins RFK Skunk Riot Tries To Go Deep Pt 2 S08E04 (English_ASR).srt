00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,299
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,099
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,900
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,059
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,419
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,140
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,699
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,439
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,340
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,340
to the underground

18
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,359
weird before we get started too much I

19
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,939
got to tell you Francis

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,799
you tend to either cut off your head or

21
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,839
your chin

22
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,659
it's like very common

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,079
you know and you do have a very like

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,000
long you know oval shaped head but still

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,780
like try to back up off the camera a

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,280
little bit so that don't happen

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,960
I mean every now and again you'll like

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,960
reach in and it'll be like this

29
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:19,200
awkward moments yeah what really hurts

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,560
me is that like if I put on my glasses

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,478
it's like a really awkward distance so I

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
can't see that well without them but

33
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,739
then if I put them on I have to be like

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,600
way far back and that's awkward too so

35
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:36,000
well I'm sorry you know I don't I'm like

36
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,399
all sweaty and don't have petrified

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,978
bones and stuff like that but you know

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,939
I'm a cultivator not like a show

39
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:47,039
personality like exactly exactly yeah I

40
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,459
I just left the garden seconds ago

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,700
compared to compared to most shows uh

42
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,978
Matt and I are pretty Bare Bones yeah we

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,618
try to make the content speak for itself

44
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,780
rather than like all the fancy

45
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,578
accoutrements that come with it Gabby

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,060
and I used to go to so many concerts

47
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:08,939
together and we would often have like

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,280
joints of like dog and super dog and

49
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,139
different hybrids with us and it got to

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,878
the point where like often people would

51
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:17,279
like that were standing next to us it

52
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,378
would smell so good they would want to

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,180
share it with us yeah and him and I used

54
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,878
to have these like running debates if we

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,860
should like share or not because we had

56
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,899
literally been at events where like we

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,540
shared a few times and like people's

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,879
knees would Buckle because they got way

59
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,759
too high and then like security would

60
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,459
have to come and like help them you know

61
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,199
and so like yeah we got to the point

62
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,459
where because I can tell some stories

63
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,919
like that

64
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,739
today

65
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,619
um you know like the dog was like I mean

66
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,378
it still is but like it was really a lot

67
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,700
stronger than what most people had

68
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:56,639
access to

69
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,439
yeah so we smoked it every day so we had

70
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,299
a certain tolerance to it but there was

71
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,219
a lot of people that like two three hits

72
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,280
and like they'd be in a space they were

73
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,859
a bit uncomfortable in oh yeah

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,300
okay I'll start by telling a story I'll

75
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,940
start by telling a

76
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,719
story when the chem dog ruins somebody's

77
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,199
day

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:19,199
let's hear it um so I went to a Blues

79
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,939
Traveler concert at the Greek Theater it

80
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,439
was I believe it was 1991.

81
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:28,680
uh can't be sure but it was in the early

82
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,079
90s and I used to see Blues Traveler

83
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,260
when they were just a bar band in New

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,540
York City you know playing like small

85
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,818
clubs of like 50 people

86
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,859
and you know then they got big and they

87
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,439
opened for Jerry and you know we're

88
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,819
playing the Greek Theater and so I went

89
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,560
to the Greek Theater early to wait

90
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:48,598
online to get in to get a good spot

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,979
because you know if you're out from out

92
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:51,840
here you know the Greek Theater is

93
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,859
generally general admission which is

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
awesome

95
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,640
and so I'm you know waiting online and

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,640
I'm talking to people and I meet

97
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,518
somebody and you know I'm smoking online

98
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:05,158
which I always do and this guy you know

99
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,239
he has you know man can I try that it's

100
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,818
amazing

101
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,620
so he takes a hit so it takes another

102
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,318
hit

103
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,660
and he went from being this like really

104
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:21,439
excited like jovial character to like

105
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,320
just completely like

106
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:27,959
and not saying anything and

107
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,899
like he got so high

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:34,019
that when the show let in

109
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:37,258
like he sat down before the line went in

110
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,779
and when the show let in he didn't go in

111
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,060
oh no I'm like bro let's go they're

112
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,719
letting us in and he just sat there and

113
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,699
I'm like [ __ ] I'm like well I'm going

114
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,800
he like he waited online for hours to

115
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,900
get a good spot at the show

116
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,840
and then I don't know if he ever made it

117
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,239
in because that's hilarious he got so

118
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,060
high from two hits of the chem Dawn

119
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:05,040
then I had this other experience this

120
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,899
one was at Phil did a show at the

121
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,220
not the maritime all yeah maybe it was

122
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,000
called The Maritime Hall it was called

123
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,940
the philharmonia it was a sing-along

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,819
and I brought my camera

125
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,759
and I was taking pictures at this show

126
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,819
and of course I'm smoking the dog

127
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,699
and this lady behind me asks if she can

128
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,680
hit my joint so I'm like sure let her

129
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,939
hit the joint I and I wonder at this

130
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,379
point because I had already had this

131
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,000
experience with a few people just like

132
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,399
oh no I smoke every day you know I'm

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,918
good so

134
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,839
she takes a couple of hits off the joint

135
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,879
I'm not paying attention she was behind

136
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,859
me right

137
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,500
and I've been taking pictures and I got

138
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,000
this like film camera around my neck you

139
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,360
know with a strap

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,478
next thing I know she collapses because

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,699
like falling on top of me and I'm like

142
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,159
what's going on so I spin around and

143
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,038
when I sping her and spin around my

144
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,620
camera spins around and clocks are in

145
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:05,959
the head it was like it was like a

146
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,819
one-two punch

147
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,038
she was going down from the chem dog and

148
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,139
then my camera

149
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,939
and she had to get taken to like rock

150
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,740
Med over there and they're like what is

151
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,800
she on what happened and I was like it's

152
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:24,780
just weed

153
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,879
and like you know so so yeah I've had a

154
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,138
number of times when I shared the chem

155
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,300
dog with people

156
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,620
and it didn't go good and after a while

157
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,960
I started just telling people like

158
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,899
Francis said like you know I'd be like

159
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,698
no sorry you know and

160
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,519
that just makes him want it more like

161
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,500
people people thought people thought we

162
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,000
were being dicks and like Gabby and I

163
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
would be having these conversations like

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,199
are we going to ruin this person's

165
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,579
experience by being cool yeah you know

166
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,579
it was like an on it happened

167
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,060
I've been telling everyone I'm stingy

168
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,538
it's like a thousand people

169
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,780
you know on Discord that things that

170
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:09,418
Gabby is [ __ ] just stingy holding on

171
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,839
to it all Gabby

172
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:15,478
right I mean I uh

173
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,159
that's funny

174
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,620
I will say I don't know I don't know if

175
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,259
you heard this part uh yeah but you put

176
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,500
I I have mentioned a few times how like

177
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,538
when we were doing all of those when we

178
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,860
were making those like super dog hybrids

179
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:31,139
and we were playing around and we were

180
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,240
doing all those outcrosses and stuff

181
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,699
Gabby was honestly like one of the

182
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,519
people like earliest people amongst my

183
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,240
entire friend crew that sort of saw like

184
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:44,038
the future American Seed sales coming

185
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,720
and he used to talk to me and be like

186
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,538
dude we could we could take this eight

187
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,580
lighter you know because we did Big seed

188
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,500
runs you know we take this eight lighter

189
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,359
and he's like we could make so many

190
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,000
seeds with this eight lighter it would

191
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,639
just blow anything you could do with

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,860
flour out of the window yeah like we

193
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,660
could sell so many seeds and it was like

194
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,340
so early it was this was I don't know

195
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,560
when it was probably early 2000s or

196
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,079
something it was so early it was long

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,259
before you know seed companies in

198
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,639
America and IG made it like feasible I

199
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,560
honestly like we'd get into arguments

200
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,060
and I was like I don't see it dude I

201
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,139
don't see how to be able to do it I

202
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,720
don't see how we'd be able to have

203
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,699
customers all these take money and all

204
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,860
these people

205
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,960
no we couldn't at the time

206
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,879
but you were right you saw what was

207
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,680
coming and I was like you know later

208
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,658
it's not it's not gonna work and then

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,360
like 10 years later I was like man we

210
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:38,458
were just like too early business models

211
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,139
that are built on volume

212
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,838
and there's business models that are

213
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,759
built on scarcity you know and the

214
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,100
margins are very different you know if

215
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,200
you have huge volume you can have

216
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,080
smaller margins

217
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,060
you know if you've got big volume if

218
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,259
you've got big margins you don't need

219
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,018
huge

220
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,200
yeah I mean it's crazy because it's kind

221
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:03,060
of the same thing with clones right now

222
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,278
except it's more like people taking

223
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,319
advantage like selling [ __ ] for like

224
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,039
fifteen hundred dollars a piece that's

225
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,240
just like a garbage cross you know just

226
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,399
because they made a good name for

227
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
themselves and like at the emerald cup

228
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
people will be waiting online for like

229
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,300
the entire Emerald cup to pay fifteen

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,860
hundred dollars for for clones that

231
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:27,299
ended up having virus

232
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:30,360
yep you know like yep it was just you

233
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:35,838
know I mean it's part of it is

234
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:40,139
successful branding and then not being

235
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:43,620
honorable about it yes very much so I

236
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:45,778
mean it sucks because I think it's a

237
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,639
flawed business plan because as soon as

238
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:49,620
you build up your business to the point

239
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,179
where like you have all these people

240
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,200
that respect you and think that you're

241
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,759
awesome

242
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,660
and then all of a sudden you [ __ ]

243
00:09:53,759 --> 00:10:00,419
everybody and the word gets out and like

244
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:02,399
it's so much worse now I heard a lot of

245
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,019
stories about deals that went bad with

246
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,159
them I I mean I don't know if you want

247
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,519
to cut this out because I ain't trying

248
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,980
to talk [ __ ] about people but um you

249
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,539
know he had contracts with people that

250
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,879
he had to give them like they had to

251
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:17,458
give a certain dollar amount for that

252
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,519
crop and their crop got completely

253
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:22,379
ruined because it was all virus yeah and

254
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,019
he still wanted his money

255
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:27,899
yeah like he destroyed these people's

256
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,179
livelihood by giving them like

257
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,980
infected and I'm not saying he did it on

258
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,259
purpose but like you give people

259
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,200
infected genetics and then you sue them

260
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,819
for not giving you the 200 bucks that

261
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,278
like you know they you know and

262
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,459
meanwhile these people couldn't get 300

263
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,679
bucks or 400 bucks for like quality herb

264
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,199
that was you know yeah

265
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,838
it was just like I mean the thing is is

266
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,620
like Francis and I said the seeds are so

267
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,800
cheap

268
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,078
right and if you have a problem

269
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,299
like this is an opportunity to show

270
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,578
people that you're solid or that you're

271
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,979
a scammer exactly that could have

272
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,139
happened to anyone that you know the

273
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,539
seeds were no good whatever

274
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,338
they just need to be like look we stand

275
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,199
behind you know our name and our product

276
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,899
and anyone that bought that is going to

277
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,100
get you know not just their seeds

278
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,899
replaced they're going to get extra

279
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,060
stuff and yeah you know wasting their

280
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,519
time make the customer feel good because

281
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,679
in the end the seeds don't cost you [ __ ]

282
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,560
yep you know and like you took so much

283
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,319
into making your reputation

284
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,899
how do you just screw so many people

285
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,720
over let the whole world know that that

286
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,458
you're terrible and [ __ ] over your

287
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,160
entire business I don't understand how

288
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:43,078
people do that I run into this all the

289
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,500
time Gabby when we chat where it's like

290
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,778
a lot of times I will talk in

291
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,820
generalities about like certain things

292
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,740
that go on in the community because even

293
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,160
just telling stories that are true

294
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,019
people get mad but if you mention like

295
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,659
when we if I mention somebody's name

296
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,299
specifically as an example their friends

297
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:05,639
will like cut out that 15 second clip

298
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:08,458
and send it to them and then I'll have

299
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,559
like furious people in my DMs all mad

300
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,359
that I'm like trying to like [ __ ] with

301
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,059
their wallet or destroy their way of

302
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,100
life or like disparage them in some

303
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,539
fashion you know okay so one thing that

304
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,379
I want to say that's not really a story

305
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:24,360
I don't know if it was not so dog or

306
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,720
someone else in the Discord that said

307
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,220
that what people appreciate me is that I

308
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,920
didn't Flex

309
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,778
yeah and

310
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,159
you know I thought about it and I said

311
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:38,879
to myself

312
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:41,699
I'm not opposed to flexing yeah for [ __ ]

313
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,120
that actually I can Flex about I don't

314
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,940
feel I don't feel like I'm that response

315
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,299
for it and there's other things that I'm

316
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:54,779
so much more proud of like yeah my hydro

317
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:55,919
store the garden spout you know I I had

318
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:58,439
the first

319
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,778
real Grow shops in Mendocino County

320
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,700
there was Spare Time Supply but they

321
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:05,399
sold lights in the back of an ocean

322
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,500
container to people that knew about them

323
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,940
yeah

324
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,600
I opened up

325
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,660
I opened up a grow store in Willits at

326
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,240
the time Highway 101

327
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,879
stopped being a highway and just was

328
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,220
like a one lane in each Direction Road

329
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,159
through the town of Willards so anyone

330
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,240
traveling north would drive straight

331
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,500
through town

332
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,079
yeah and I got this little store on Main

333
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,179
Street what I was saying was that when I

334
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,620
put my store up it was right on Highway

335
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:41,039
101

336
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,980
and I literally lit up the highway with

337
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,799
the orange glow of high pressure

338
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,680
frames and it was the Talk of the Town

339
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,419
like nobody could believe that I was

340
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,399
being so ballsy

341
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,179
to like put these lights up in the

342
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,940
street

343
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,838
yeah you know and

344
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,899
um

345
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,720
you know one by one you know the locals

346
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,159
from the hills came down and they heard

347
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,399
that they could trust me and that I

348
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,860
would deliver soil to them holy [ __ ] I

349
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,419
delivered soil in the most dangerous and

350
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,240
not like dangerous like gun dangerous

351
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:17,039
like the roads were just psychotic but

352
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,019
if I would have known I never would have

353
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,578
done it you know you get like committed

354
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,220
to this drive and now you can't turn

355
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:26,219
around yeah driving this like U-Haul

356
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,620
style box truck looks overloaded with

357
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,540
soil through like 10 creeks and [ __ ]

358
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,480
you're like oh my God

359
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:35,759
but um I taught a lot of people how to

360
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,860
grow weed and I taught a lot of people

361
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,480
how to grow better weed than they were

362
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,639
already growing

363
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,659
and

364
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,839
brought new products to our Market

365
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:50,100
and that's the stuff that I'm really

366
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,959
proud of

367
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,199
and

368
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,239
it's not that I um

369
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,000
I didn't always love cannabis and always

370
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,198
grow cannabis but for a long part of my

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,659
life

372
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,639
okay so let me take a step back here's

373
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:08,399
how the story went

374
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,039
when I was growing before working and

375
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,839
and owning hydro stores

376
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,360
I was paranoid

377
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,880
and I wasn't making friends

378
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,300
and I wasn't talking to people about

379
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,759
growing weed which is what I realized I

380
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:25,919
really like to do is talk to people

381
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,958
about growing weed which is one of the

382
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:31,259
reasons why me and not so dog got along

383
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,578
so good like because that's what what he

384
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,860
wanted to do too

385
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:37,679
and um

386
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,899
what happened was one day the hydro

387
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,519
store that I was shopping at it's called

388
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,059
Hydro Depot

389
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,578
the guy asked me if I wanted a job

390
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:49,379
and at first I was like no I don't want

391
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:51,299
a job you know I'm doing pretty good

392
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:53,338
doing what I'm doing

393
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,919
and then I realized

394
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,860
that if I got this job

395
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,139
and I worked it for a few months I could

396
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,019
make a legitimate income and then like

397
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,720
maybe work towards buying a house

398
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,799
instead of like you know renting my

399
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,639
entire life

400
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:14,159
so I started working at the Hydro Depot

401
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,860
and that's when I realized that as much

402
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,198
as I have a passion for growing

403
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,899
have a passion for talking to people

404
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,539
about weed and teaching people what I

405
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,659
know about weed and

406
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:29,939
I really felt like my calling

407
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:32,698
was to do that

408
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,139
because not only was I making a good

409
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,139
living

410
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:40,500
I was loving every minute of it you know

411
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:43,139
when when clients would come in

412
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,639
I would love talking to them you know

413
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,278
like

414
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,600
you know I let other people handle the

415
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:54,720
inventory and the you know

416
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,820
all the you know boring stuff of running

417
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,560
a business and I would just talk to

418
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,920
people about growing weed

419
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:04,438
and I was always really honest with them

420
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:06,959
and that's why people came back

421
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,339
you know because they knew I wasn't just

422
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,078
trying to sell them some [ __ ] because

423
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:11,399
oftentimes people would come in and be

424
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,798
like should I buy this and I'd be like

425
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,620
absolutely not don't do it

426
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,179
you know perfect example was LED lights

427
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:21,000
before they were ready

428
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,880
you know when I opened up my store it

429
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,279
was a 2002 there was already people

430
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,360
trying to sell LED lights

431
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:33,240
remember the UFOs Francis oh yeah you

432
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,918
know I mean they were garbage they you

433
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,319
couldn't successfully grow basil with

434
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,380
those plants let alone a fruiting crop

435
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,779
and um and they sold for a lot of money

436
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,820
and I used to tell people if this

437
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,700
technology worked

438
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:50,220
I would make so much money because

439
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,660
everybody would want to change everybody

440
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,419
with high pressure sodium would

441
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,240
immediately want to buy these these LEDs

442
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,520
I would kill it yeah but I couldn't with

443
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,140
good conscience so even though people

444
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,359
coming in like wanting the lights and

445
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,360
I'd have to be like no it's a bad idea

446
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,119
you know and so I'm proud

447
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,279
and this is a very minor Flex that I

448
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,918
feel throughout the years I made a good

449
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,839
reputation for myself

450
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,538
um with Growers

451
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,879
because I was honest and I was a place

452
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:22,200
where they could come for information

453
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,100
and

454
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,600
they felt safe yeah you know people felt

455
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:29,339
safe at my start

456
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,719
and

457
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:32,639
you know so when we're talking about

458
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,558
flexing it's like

459
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,140
I think I can Flex about that a little

460
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,178
bit I'm proud of proud of that I hope

461
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,179
that that's you know

462
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:46,140
it's going to be a part of my legacy you

463
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,700
know when I'm gone for sure the chem dog

464
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:52,020
thing is just like

465
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,480
you know well I don't think I mean I'm

466
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,519
blushing and you know like kind of like

467
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,679
it makes me smile that I'm getting this

468
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,859
attention about it but like

469
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,679
Greg he's the one that popped the seeds

470
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:06,538
people that he distributed to like what

471
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,100
are they getting credit for like where

472
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:11,579
do you draw the line of giving people

473
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:16,319
props sure me is it you Francis is it

474
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:18,839
Jason and Ben or like people 10 10 rows

475
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,000
past them that got it that

476
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,199
maybe did better [ __ ] with it than all

477
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,140
of us

478
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,259
well you know I mean

479
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,179
I look at it a little different you know

480
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,500
um I'll I'll talk about the chem dog for

481
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,940
a second and then I'll move on to the

482
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,619
store because I actually think there's

483
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,620
some parts about the store that people

484
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,959
would not really realize today but I'll

485
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:41,459
start with the chem dog obviously I

486
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,440
think that

487
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,000
you know for whatever reason even though

488
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,820
it might be like even though people

489
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,759
might play a small role in something

490
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:53,939
that role could be super important like

491
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:57,058
it turns out somehow that the cutting

492
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,038
that you brought West seems to be the

493
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:01,678
one that survived

494
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:05,279
and it got and I'm not sure if it would

495
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,080
be around if you hadn't come out to

496
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,200
California with it and then eventually

497
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:13,319
shared it with a few close friends uh

498
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,980
like skunk VA or IC Collective or myself

499
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:18,899
or whoever and so you know like that

500
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,140
might be small but it's also important

501
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,759
because it was a critical step like when

502
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,500
they wanted it back on the East Coast

503
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,859
they had to get it from the West Coast

504
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,019
because that's where and in prohibition

505
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,599
right where people get busted and people

506
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,460
move on and things change a lot of cool

507
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,339
things got lost

508
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,860
right and so I kind of feel like my only

509
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:43,740
part of the chem dog story is really

510
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:46,918
like hearing the stories early

511
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,740
right and maybe helping to preserve it

512
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,179
at a time before it was famous

513
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,380
and then

514
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,538
like and so perhaps like on the on the

515
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,220
the store thing people might not realize

516
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:00,839
this but one of the things that Gabby

517
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,319
was talking about which was critical

518
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,418
back then was that information on how to

519
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,139
grow good weed was really hard to come

520
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,360
by

521
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,259
and most people that knew how to do it

522
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,719
wouldn't talk to you so in stores were

523
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,298
also super rare like Gabby is right when

524
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,038
he opened up his store he was the first

525
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:21,298
go ahead if you want to make me blush

526
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:23,940
Francis you can repeat yourself all

527
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:27,900
right so so I do feel like things about

528
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:31,580
me as as Gabby mentioned when he opened

529
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:34,259
up the store in in Mendocino County

530
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:35,699
there was like Spare Time Supply which

531
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,919
was a big player but they were

532
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,720
predominantly a garden store and an

533
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,080
outdoor store and an amendment store

534
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:47,038
there was no indoor or Greenhouse

535
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:49,379
focused store going on at all and stores

536
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,640
back then were actually rare

537
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,320
right

538
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,080
um and and there wasn't very many of

539
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,918
them and having someone in a store that

540
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:02,339
was knowledgeable and willing to talk

541
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:04,620
right was huge and it was kind of a

542
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:08,158
risque thing and even though proposition

543
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:12,058
215 had happened it was still very much

544
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,919
in the shadows and so he's he I think he

545
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:16,319
sort of opened up your shop at the very

546
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,538
beginning of like the 215 medical green

547
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,279
Rush era where there was all these

548
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:21,779
people coming to our County and coming

549
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,058
to Humboldt in these different areas

550
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,038
that were new they had no idea what they

551
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:28,200
were doing and they were like I want to

552
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,879
set up a garage in a greenhouse and I

553
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,940
don't even know what to get

554
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,220
and so for a long time it was like

555
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,840
eventually stores became like who had

556
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,880
the best price and people were more

557
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:42,359
knowledgeable but probably for the first

558
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,780
five or six years that Gabby had a store

559
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:48,839
it was I mean he sold stuff but it was

560
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:51,359
also like it was tons of education on

561
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,058
what stuff those people needed so you

562
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,879
know the store in the early years was

563
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:59,879
basically like a massive educational

564
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,220
model and then as Gabby and then you

565
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,179
know educated people they bought things

566
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,159
from him

567
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,480
yeah because they literally hadn't they

568
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,220
didn't know how to wire stuff they

569
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,720
didn't know about like you know lighting

570
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,360
boxes they didn't know about fan

571
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,220
movement they didn't know about any of

572
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,279
that and so it's like they'd have money

573
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,380
and they're like What's the best set of

574
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,740
equipment for my set of circumstances

575
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,260
and so you have this whole County that

576
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,538
was starting to really blow up and grow

577
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,640
but the funny thing about it is all the

578
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:32,099
stores that opened up they were all my

579
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,360
customers first yeah like I literally I

580
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,639
literally taught them everything that

581
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,519
they knew about the business people

582
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,220
don't realize it today but

583
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:43,259
like information

584
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,419
was the thing that was super important

585
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:48,058
people literally they had money but they

586
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:50,580
had no idea what they were doing and

587
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:53,460
like what's weird about it too is that

588
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:56,038
you start like if you spent time there

589
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,659
you learned a bunch because people would

590
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:59,220
come to you not only to get set up but

591
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,960
they would come to you with like every

592
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,120
problem imaginable

593
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,679
yeah and you would have to and Gabby

594
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,658
would have to sit down with them and

595
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,000
figure out how to solve it

596
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:12,240
and then the more you help people solve

597
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,240
it the bigger your like information or

598
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,980
expertise or knowledge base grows so

599
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,279
when someone else brings up that same

600
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,900
problem like you have right and so I

601
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,700
don't think people today with all the

602
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,200
all the forums and all the information

603
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,919
and all the internet and everything

604
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,960
really understand how hard it was

605
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,200
to talk to people that knew how to grow

606
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,659
weed even on the basic level

607
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,600
like and so probably the first five or

608
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:42,299
six years his store was open it was a

609
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,158
boom time where everyone in Mendo and

610
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:47,038
Humboldt and all these places were just

611
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,419
constantly setting up new stuff whether

612
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:49,980
they were indoor whether they were

613
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:53,820
greenhouses whether they were light

614
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:57,720
deprivation it was just an enormous boom

615
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:59,460
of economy and no and very and maybe 10

616
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,679
of the people knew what they were doing

617
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,360
and would come in and like would have a

618
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,940
good idea of what they wanted and battle

619
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,479
on price and stuff but often they would

620
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,700
come in completely oblivious

621
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,220
you know and so and so I I just wanted

622
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,700
to mention that I don't think into in

623
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:21,179
2023 people understand like Dragon Ball

624
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,640
Z having a hydro store was and being

625
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:26,640
willing to openly talk about

626
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,440
you know about growing with people

627
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,360
you know I mean that was the era where

628
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,220
like you walk into a head shop and you

629
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,778
say the word bong and they toss you out

630
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,640
in case you were undercover and they

631
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:38,339
were going to shut down the real shop

632
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,380
for real right yeah um you know there

633
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:43,259
was you know there was a so it was

634
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,600
pretty risque it was like pretty out on

635
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:48,538
the on the on the Cutting Edge of things

636
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,339
if you will uh to do that type of stuff

637
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:53,759
and so there's an enormous amount of

638
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:57,000
people that got their start buying

639
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,859
equipment and buying soil and buying all

640
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,480
kinds of stuff I mean one thing I could

641
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:03,599
mention is like when you opened your

642
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,360
shop dude uh we were still all growing

643
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,658
in like in um you know in like a light

644
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:11,519
Warrior or you know or perlite peat moss

645
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,799
mixes and stuff like that Gabby was one

646
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,319
of the first people to really like

647
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,480
preach about cocoa fiber

648
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,240
and how it was going to revolutionize

649
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,339
like growing

650
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:27,240
and you know people had no idea what it

651
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:30,599
was that's wow like at all you know and

652
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,659
it was brand new okay go ahead so what I

653
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,819
remember is that you know cocoa fiber if

654
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:38,700
I if I remember correctly the reason why

655
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:41,038
it became popular was in Europe they

656
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,140
decided that they wanted more

657
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:47,099
environmentally friendly medium to grow

658
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,419
in right and Rockwell wasn't it and so

659
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,459
they were looking around for something

660
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,640
that was biodegradable and a renewable

661
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,640
resource and they realized that there

662
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,820
was these giant piles of cocoa fiber and

663
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,559
Sri Lanka and India and other places

664
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:04,139
that were just waste products that they

665
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,778
shredded off the cocoa to get to the

666
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,520
coconut yeah right

667
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:10,380
and so they realized that if they

668
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,400
started buffering it and treating it the

669
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,039
right way

670
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,900
that you know

671
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:19,140
um it could be an excellent grow media

672
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,120
yeah and then Gabby got some

673
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,580
and there was stuff that was from like

674
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,099
because in Canada that was RHP certified

675
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,658
which basically meant it was regulated

676
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:30,178
and it was guaranteed to be a certain

677
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:32,340
level of quality and we started growing

678
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:34,440
in it and I remember Gabby being like Oh

679
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,658
my god dude like we'd pull pot he'd pull

680
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,360
plants out of pots and be like look at

681
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,400
these roots I bet like literally like

682
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,798
look at how white and happy look at look

683
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,419
at and from that point on he was kind of

684
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:47,278
like a little bit of a prophet about it

685
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:50,100
and no one had ever really heard about

686
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:53,880
it and his store had it

687
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,798
um and I think we he got lucky and that

688
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,080
he was getting it from reputable sources

689
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:59,759
yeah and there there was other people

690
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,500
that were getting it cheaper but they

691
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,778
were getting it full of like sea salt

692
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,058
and it was unbuffered and people were

693
00:28:03,778 --> 00:28:08,220
having nightmares in the beginning oh

694
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:11,038
sure right

695
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,558
um but I mean his store was open right

696
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,359
at the time that like cocoa fiber first

697
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,740
started percolating around and no one

698
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,658
had even heard of it

699
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,940
you know

700
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,559
um and you know people back then they

701
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,558
didn't even know you know it was even

702
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,599
simple stuff like why 600s were better

703
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:29,158
than thousands because they were cooler

704
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,079
and they gave you more points of light

705
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,880
yeah you know

706
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,639
um there was a lot of stuff that people

707
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,159
consider basic now which was like

708
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,720
essentially in my opinion like hidden

709
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,840
knowledge

710
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,919
and so he's right he would just talk all

711
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,240
day long

712
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,159
to people

713
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,079
and they would write out all kinds of

714
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,000
lists of stuff they needed and then he

715
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,278
would hand the list to like an employee

716
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,480
and they would start filling it and he

717
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,759
would turn around and he would talk to

718
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,159
the next person

719
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,140
and so he just talked about growing weed

720
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,840
like here's the reality

721
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:07,820
Francis was way better than I was really

722
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,819
yeah well you know he was like yeah

723
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:13,139
he had patients

724
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:15,379
I'm just like always like I'm trying to

725
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,380
help people

726
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,980
I mean I wanted it wasn't like I was

727
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,538
rushing him out the door I wanted to

728
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,058
make a comfortable environment but I was

729
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:28,200
just always busy too one thing like I

730
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:31,319
tried myself in so my hydro store was

731
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,538
based on largely

732
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,480
a Dutch model

733
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,679
and the Dutch model was I went to

734
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,860
Holland

735
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:45,019
and I went to the growth stores

736
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:46,619
and they all had espresso makers there

737
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:48,720
and

738
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,639
I had this idea

739
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,778
okay because when I was working for

740
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,899
Slavic

741
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:57,419
she would always say to me gabby I want

742
00:29:54,898 --> 00:30:01,079
them to buy and get out

743
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:02,700
and what I try to tell him is that the

744
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:04,619
longer they stayed

745
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,500
I got opportunities to sell them more

746
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:09,418
stuff yeah you know he would see he

747
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,519
would see it as I'm just talking to

748
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,038
these guys you know for 45 minutes about

749
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,480
growing you know and that you know he'd

750
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:18,119
rather maybe sweeping the floor or

751
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,740
something else yeah but in the end what

752
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,918
I was doing was building a repertoire

753
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,319
with the customers you know that it

754
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,440
would trust me and then they would shop

755
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,898
exclusively at our store and you know

756
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,240
it would trust me so when I opened up my

757
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:37,139
own stores the garden spout

758
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,899
you know I put a coffee bar in and I had

759
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,340
shares there for the customers to hang

760
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,379
out

761
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:46,259
and that was pretty unheard of for a

762
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,360
growth store was to make a place like I

763
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:51,000
wanted it to be a cool place

764
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,798
where people want to hang out yeah you

765
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,359
know and of course some people abuse the

766
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,599
privilege and got annoying and we'd have

767
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,038
to ask him to leave of course but for

768
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,199
the most part like

769
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,298
it wasn't only me talking to people

770
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,880
other people would like hear what people

771
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:08,819
were saying and then they would like

772
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,960
interject and it became like almost a

773
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:12,359
gathering point

774
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,120
you know so as far as how I got involved

775
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:18,178
with the cocoa it's because that's what

776
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:21,058
the Dutch were doing okay and I met

777
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,519
people while I was in Holland

778
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:27,778
um at the Hawaii Fair which is like a

779
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:30,298
traditional AG show yeah and um

780
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:32,278
and then when I opened up my store they

781
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:34,619
had heard about it they came and visited

782
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:36,659
me and you know so the first one we

783
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:39,418
would buy because Coco

784
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,980
and then Canada Coco and then you know I

785
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,320
started trying to Source some myself

786
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,599
from some of these reputable companies

787
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,700
but

788
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,199
like I said like those are the things

789
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,600
that I want to be proud of

790
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,659
you know to me that that's like

791
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,480
a much bigger

792
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:59,580
you know I think that's my minor Flex

793
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,500
you know I think it's a one thing I want

794
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:03,418
to say about the chem dog Flex go ahead

795
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,720
how much of an [ __ ] would I look like

796
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,460
if I did Flex about my part with the

797
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,500
chem dub

798
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,840
I mean I think I'd be in like I'd be

799
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,519
looked at like an [ __ ] like like

800
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:16,079
you're saying other people think others

801
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,480
are [ __ ] who are doing that Flex

802
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:23,158
yeah you know the only one who's got the

803
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,500
real Flex is Greg yeah you know and like

804
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,480
anyone else past that it's just kind of

805
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,398
like all right you have it what did you

806
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,339
do with it yeah and you know like

807
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,199
Francis said people did good [ __ ] I

808
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:35,339
think Jason made beautiful crosses with

809
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,980
the condo

810
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:42,000

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,298
great stuff with it and and that's their

813
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,658
Flex

814
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:50,879
what they did with the chem dog not

815
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:53,520

816
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,399

817
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,139
you know and having said that like

818
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,058

827
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,119
yeah I mean

828
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,558
I love this yeah I think it goes back to

829
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:25,259
a different era

830
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:28,798
where the way you got Cuts generally

831
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:31,740
speaking back then was like you honestly

832
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,720
became good friends with someone and

833
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,880
then what was that like and then you

834
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,220
shared things and then you did things

835
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,039
together and you now people would call

836
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,558
it a collaboration but back in the day

837
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,740
it was more just like you know friends

838
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:48,898
doing cool little side projects together

839
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,880
you know like friends sharing Cuts so we

840
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:53,759
could help keep them alive because there

841
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,320
was fires and accidents and busts and

842
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,599
different things that could happen where

843
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:01,259
you could lose something and it was much

844
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,639
more informal so it was like you know

845
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:04,140
um you know sometimes people would be

846
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,059
like well how do you get cuts and it's

847
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,980
like I don't know you like become

848
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:09,539
friends with someone that has Cuts but

849
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,878
that's not the reason why you became

850
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:14,519
friends it's like you have an honest

851
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,759
relationship with someone and then that

852
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,500
leads to other things yeah you know so

853
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,419
it's almost like organic in the way that

854
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,418
it like it developed

855
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,739
you know uh and um

856
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:28,559
I don't know that's just kind of how I

857
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:30,299
see it but I think I think it's very one

858
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,940
thing

859
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,619
it's not necessarily a flex but I think

860
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,800
it's very very

861
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:40,679
um special to be someone who inspires

862
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,500
someone else who does something quite

863
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,800
remarkable it changes a culture whether

864
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,599
it's sour whether it's cam whether it's

865
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,000
getting to the West Coast

866
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,580
but helping inspiring other whether

867
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,980
you're teaching growing any of that to

868
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,779
be able to like know on your deathbed

869
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,280
that you've left something behind that

870
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,740
has inspired someone else and made their

871
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,820
life better then that's that you know I

872
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:05,819
mean like that should be good enough

873
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,680
right that's ultimate I think so that's

874
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,539
why I said like if you called up and

875
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,179
said hey Gabby

876
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:14,519
I was talking with not so dog and we

877
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:17,819
want to talk to you about the garden

878
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,980
spout and how you you know accomplish so

879
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,380
much and then it'd be like all right

880
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,659
yeah I mean like I'm proud of that and I

881
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,900
can actually like you know

882
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:29,519
you know but like this idea that I had

883
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,700
such an integral

884
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,380
part of it I mean I had a little part of

885
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:36,000
it I brought it out to the West Coast I

886
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,680
don't want to minimize it either like

887
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,780
because I know if I didn't bring it out

888
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:43,199
and it's not out here and maybe it's

889
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,900
lost but um products that we did I wish

890
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,519
the breeding projects that we did

891
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,220
produced more of like what I actually

892
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:53,519
wanted yeah you know like more of a chem

893
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:55,799
dog you know tramping profile because we

894
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,759
we did some great [ __ ] but it just

895
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,980
didn't turn out that dog-like and so if

896
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,200
I would have done that then I could have

897
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,539
been proud of that and then I could have

898
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:09,358
felt like I had more of a part of the

899
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:12,139
chem dog history because I took it to

900
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:17,098
the next step and maybe that is a reason

901
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:19,199
for Jason and Ben to flex because that

902
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:22,859
is what they're doing right sure they're

903
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:25,078
taking plants that

904
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:27,539
pretty much it would be a mistake for

905
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,519
most people to grow it period

906
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:30,960
you know like unless you're looking to

907
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,759
use it for breeding

908
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,740
you know like growing this for the

909
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,599
flower

910
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:39,479
you know and having said that I want to

911
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,240
grow it for flower again because

912
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,980
I feel like I have knowledge and tools

913
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,479
available to me now that I didn't have

914
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,719
then

915
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,099
and maybe I could get it to show me

916
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,879
something

917
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,260
you know better than back in the day

918
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,059
absolutely you know

919
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,180
um the one thing I was mentioning in the

920
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:02,219
Discord is leaf tissue sampling yeah

921
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:03,899
yeah that blew my mind I hadn't even

922
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:05,519
thought of doing that with it

923
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,039
yeah so I've already done this at

924
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,480
facilities that I worked with worked at

925
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,039
and

926
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,380
so

927
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,779
I don't know who to give credit to but

928
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,660
somebody mentioned to me that you know

929
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,280
we've been looking in books at this is

930
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:22,618
what this deficiency looks like this

931
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,380
what this deficiency looks like

932
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,180
but generally what that means is this is

933
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,760
what a plant looks like when it has zero

934
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:33,419
nitrogen or like it's not deficient it's

935
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,420
just absent yeah and all and also

936
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,139
or extreme deficiency right yeah and

937
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:43,139
then also those photos never show you

938
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:46,078
what does deficiency look like when it's

939
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:48,299
a number of elements yeah that's true

940
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,400
you know like because what it's going to

941
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,039
look like is going to look different

942
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,139
and you know for years

943
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,480
the standard thing was oh I had more

944
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,338
calmag yeah yeah it doesn't look right

945
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,139
well what kind of whatever it was just

946
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:02,820
add more calmag it always makes

947
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:04,199
everything better yeah it always makes

948
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,440
it green

949
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,460
plants like calcium and when I did my

950
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,079
testing

951
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,559
the testing showed that I needed more

952
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,200
calcium okay but at least we're not just

953
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:18,960
guessing yeah you know the testing is

954
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:24,059
really inexpensive it's like 75 to 100

955
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,220
per sample okay okay and so it's very

956
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,578
inexpensive and it gives you a lot of

957
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:32,838
information and with the chem dog being

958
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:36,900
a plant that wants to consume itself

959
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:38,578
prior to harvest like you know two weeks

960
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,680
before you're supposed to cut it you'd

961
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:44,220
have not a single Green Leaf left on it

962
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:46,440
yeah no no it was so hard to keep this

963
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:47,039
plant yeah

964
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,400
um

965
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,380
with uh with the leaf analysis we can

966
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,619
learn how to feed it a little bit better

967
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:59,160
and maybe keep it Greener a little bit

968
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:01,519
longer and action you know actually get

969
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,899
a product that

970
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,159
is more like what we've been looking for

971
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,220
all this time

972
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:10,980
sure one of the one other thing I I

973
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:14,338
might mention if we're gonna like uh

974
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,559
Flex for Gabby here or whatever is

975
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:18,539
that's not what timing this is is it I

976
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,578
know but but I thought we did enough of

977
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,619
that you know I used to go I used to go

978
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,780
into a bunch of different hydro stores

979
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:27,119
um for various reasons and I think Gabby

980
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:31,079
was the first person that I knew that

981
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,599
was really pumping tissue culture not

982
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,339
like the meristem stuff but like the

983
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,859
proper like the cleanliness and the

984
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:39,599
propagation and all that and there was

985
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:42,480
this guy

986
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,019
um Bill Graham bill yeah still around

987
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,820
and he had these and he had these kits

988
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:52,739
uh and he Gabby used to have milky.com

989
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,780
for people that want to work for it he

990
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:57,419
used to come into the store and Gabby

991
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:01,260
would have him do demos

992
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:04,559
of how to sterilize like a tub how to

993
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:07,079
get clean how to like take clean cuts

994
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:10,078
and like bleach and sterilize the cuts

995
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,560
and then get them into solution and I

996
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,359
can tell you like as a as a grower it

997
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:18,838
looked like some Voodoo in the beginning

998
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:21,059
I bet you know like at the time nobody

999
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,099
was doing that nobody was even thinking

1000
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:25,559
about it like nobody was nobody was

1001
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,240
applying that to cannabis but I by any

1002
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,400
means yeah

1003
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:31,078
um and you know he had a whole shelf on

1004
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,760
his store and he would invite bill in

1005
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,560
and he would and they would do Demos in

1006
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,440
the shop and he would get people to try

1007
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,539
it and wow and all that type of stuff

1008
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,000
and I mean that was literally in the

1009
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:44,219
early 2000s

1010
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,900
uh long now it's become like a big the

1011
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:47,759
only reason that made me think of it is

1012
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,760
as you were talking Gabby about Leaf

1013
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,700
tissue like I kind of feel like because

1014
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,060
weed was so illegal for a while we were

1015
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:59,219
reduced to observational stuff and we

1016
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:01,019
didn't really have access to labs and we

1017
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:03,299
didn't really have access to some of the

1018
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:07,079
scientific stuff that regular AG did

1019
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:09,359
because we were too scared and the labs

1020
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:12,480
didn't want to deal with us so we had to

1021
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,940
like work off what we saw

1022
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,920
and talking amongst ourselves and now

1023
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,740
he's right in the sense that you can go

1024
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,280
get tissue analysis and you can get hard

1025
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:25,199
data that backs up your thoughts

1026
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,839
right yeah

1027
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,460
um but you know tissue culture was like

1028
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,619
some voodoo

1029
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,559
you know taking these tiny little

1030
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:36,300
plantlets it seemed very extreme at the

1031
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,799
time like why would you go through all

1032
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,599
that trouble when you just clogged it

1033
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,940
seemed extreme but now knowing more

1034
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,519
about diseases you know hops latent

1035
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,079
viroid and stuff it's I wish everyone

1036
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,259
would have been using that method and

1037
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,000
you know Bill Bill would come in and and

1038
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,760
you know Gabby would tell a bunch of

1039
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,320
good customers and friends and stuff the

1040
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,420
dude's gonna come in and he's going to

1041
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,460
give a demo and he's going to teach you

1042
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,559
how to use this stuff because it was

1043
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,358
like especially to a bunch of Growers it

1044
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,699
was like some straight Voodoo it was

1045
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,098
Advanced so let me say something real

1046
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:11,939
let me let me say something real fast

1047
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:14,338
so I sold a bunch of those kits

1048
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,619
yeah and I honestly believe almost no

1049
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:19,739
one took it out of the box I believe it

1050
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:22,200
because it was still it was still too

1051
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:24,358
like intimidating like the kid didn't

1052
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:26,399
cause [ __ ] I think it was like 135 bucks

1053
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:28,139
yeah yeah something like that you know

1054
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,820
it was really inexpensive but they had

1055
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:32,219
to go buy a pressure cooker and make the

1056
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,000
gel and like you know I was able to sell

1057
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,459
it

1058
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,679
but like most people were still a little

1059
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,980
bit intimidated to do it and I remember

1060
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,980
I was

1061
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,440
in one day Bill Graham

1062
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,960
Grant store and we do it

1063
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,960
and then every single day

1064
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,639
I was doing tissue culture in my store

1065
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,420
in front of people that were just

1066
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,420
walking in and

1067
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,139
you know

1068
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,240
even though they didn't do it

1069
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:05,338
they were still like inspired and it

1070
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:07,379
made them excited about something you

1071
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:08,279
know exactly so

1072
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,720
um

1073
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,579
but yeah a few people actually did it

1074
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,179
um

1075
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:17,180
I really thought I was gonna

1076
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,519
be adopting this and doing this

1077
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,640
and it was kind of like the seed thing

1078
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,980
they just weren't ready yet yeah I mean

1079
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,858
the same thing is interesting in that

1080
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,960
you know I I talk about this on the show

1081
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,818
quite often where it was like

1082
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,760
you know Gabby and I and some other

1083
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:42,179
close like we honestly were just trying

1084
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,980
to make better wheat and all the seeds

1085
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:46,199
we made all the projects that we did

1086
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,659
everything like that especially because

1087
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:50,519
of what like flower prices were back

1088
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:52,920
then it was a terrible financial

1089
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:56,039
decision because we could have just been

1090
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,740
blowing up rooms of flour and getting

1091
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,920
top dollar for it way back then you know

1092
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:03,959
so it was literally like a labor of love

1093
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,700
you know and it was it wasn't

1094
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,579
necessarily about like oh what do we

1095
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:11,818
think people will like it was like what

1096
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,318
do we like personally and can we make

1097
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,599
stuff that we like

1098
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,980
and you know Gabby I I was thinking

1099
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,859
about it because

1100
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,960
uh Matt and I have been blessed in a way

1101
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:23,818
to talk to some of like Neville's good

1102
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,559
friends that were close to him in the

1103
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:27,779
last years of his life

1104
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,759
and it's funny because one of the things

1105
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,560
Neville said is like I wish I didn't

1106
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,500
fail so much

1107
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,480
right I don't know if I did if I don't

1108
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,900
know if the best stuff that I got I

1109
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,000
improved on it at all I wish I knew now

1110
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,858
I wish I would have known then what I

1111
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,639
know now and I had a different shot at

1112
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:46,559
it

1113
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,078
and so I think that thing that you

1114
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,539
expressed is very common in breeding

1115
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,039
where people that breed are very

1116
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:55,739
self-critical

1117
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,239
and they tend to Discount what they did

1118
00:44:55,739 --> 00:45:00,239
when they did it

1119
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:03,000
because they wanted it to be better

1120
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,578
and they had their own goals in it and

1121
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,519
then every failure I mean there's a lot

1122
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:10,680
of things if you take it serious there

1123
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,900
has to be a lot of failure because you

1124
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:15,000
you'd just be hitting you know numbers

1125
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,980
all day and that's that's just not how

1126
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,900
it works that's not how I mean I I don't

1127
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,818
think you I don't think it's failure in

1128
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,019
the sense of you produce Something

1129
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:25,739
Beautiful

1130
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:28,318
it's a failure in the sense of you have

1131
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:30,659
an expectation of what you're going to

1132
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,659
produce and you have a lot less control

1133
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:37,318
of it than you know because that's just

1134
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:39,480
ego you know either that or it's really

1135
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,300
expert breeding

1136
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:46,440
all right really anal attentive people

1137
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:49,500
like I just I mean

1138
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,119
you would think like so when we did the

1139
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,900
F1 cross

1140
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,300
you know with back to the chem dog right

1141
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,519
and then we grew out so many thousands

1142
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,079
of these seeds

1143
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,679
you would have thought that some would

1144
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:06,180
have like really been dog-like yeah they

1145
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,338
just weren't

1146
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:09,960
you know so you would think like you

1147
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:12,659
know when you when you do that first

1148
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,240
cross you get the most diversity and now

1149
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:19,139
you just gotta do the hunt

1150
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:21,299
but the the skunk was so dominant

1151
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:22,980
that

1152
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,560
you know

1153
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,300
there was traces of it you know like

1154
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,489
yeah it's not like it doesn't

1155
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,339
yeah yeah of course

1156
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:33,118
[Music]

1157
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:35,699
dogweed

1158
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,019
you know the other thing the other thing

1159
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:40,078
I think we should mention because like

1160
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:43,019
the game is flipped now go ahead no go

1161
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,599
ahead uh is that when Gabby and I were

1162
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:47,940
doing all this all the feminized

1163
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,940
reversals and stuff like that were still

1164
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:54,000
years away we kind of thought that like

1165
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,920
at times that like hermaphrodism and

1166
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,039
like accidental pollinations we're gonna

1167
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,720
lead you down the wrong path

1168
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:02,818
all the stuff that we did was with

1169
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,879
regular males and so you had to create

1170
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:09,119
hybrids and then and back cross and all

1171
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:12,480
that and you know we had to grow out the

1172
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,740
seeds to see if what we did did what we

1173
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,838
wanted

1174
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:18,118
there was no idea that we could take two

1175
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,119
females and reverse one of them and add

1176
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:24,019
this it was all regular well we knew we

1177
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,160
could do it but would never consider it

1178
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:28,500
already selling seeds by that time

1179
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:31,559
feminized it's just we are delighted we

1180
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,300
thought that hermaphrodism and seeds

1181
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,858
from hermaphrodism were risk

1182
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,859
hermaphroditism

1183
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:41,779
because you were going to infect your

1184
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:44,578
line with more traits that were bad

1185
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,900
and you know and and that was just kind

1186
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:47,519
of like I don't know in the not late

1187
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:52,318
that in the early 2000 like that was

1188
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:53,818
just the the Common Thread then I think

1189
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm still on certain I was talking to

1190
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:58,380
Matthew about this the other day like to

1191
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,059
me like

1192
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,059
it's

1193
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:06,480
you know it's weird it does it seems

1194
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:08,400
like it's very common well I know it's

1195
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,219
common I know it's oh I and I know it's

1196
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,800
commonly done but I still feel like

1197
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:16,199
doing this has to pose some type of risk

1198
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,700
no I mean it's common for people to feel

1199
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,618
like you do

1200
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:21,358
what do you think we're wrong

1201
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:22,559
yes I think I think you're totally wrong

1202
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,019
but but

1203
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,619
to an extent this is proven by genetics

1204
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:30,300
like by genetic mapping yeah yeah yeah I

1205
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,680
mean maybe it's just hard for males to

1206
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,220
accept it like we might become

1207
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,219
irrelevant

1208
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:38,699
I mean it's it's actually normal I would

1209
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:40,759
accept that I would accept that more

1210
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:40,759
than

1211
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:53,159
now we've gone to a point where regular

1212
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:55,500
seeds are you know unicorns almost in

1213
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,618
the Cannabis world and almost everything

1214
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,719
is feminized reversals of some fashion

1215
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,338
yeah you know uh when Gabby and I were

1216
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,639
doing it like you know the only

1217
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:09,299
feminized seeds we knew of were

1218
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:12,019
um uh you know accidents

1219
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,019
essentially

1220
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:18,060
yeah I mean yes 100 I'd never heard of

1221
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,519
reversals I'd never heard the only

1222
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:23,099
reversals we had ever heard of then was

1223
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:25,039
like you stressed the hell out of the

1224
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:27,359
plant too

1225
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,460
hermaphrodite itself you put it in a

1226
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:32,519
small container you gave it drought you

1227
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,199
messed with the light sky cycle until it

1228
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:36,838
freaked out and did some weird stuff

1229
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:40,618
there was nothing there was no sprays we

1230
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:43,139
ever thought about trying to like induce

1231
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:46,019
anything it was like you basically like

1232
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:48,299
tortured the plant until it did what you

1233
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:50,699
wanted yeah that was the tech that we

1234
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:54,619
knew of back then I think

1235
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:54,618
and it just seemed like the wrong path

1236
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,618
yeah like I said it's very common for

1237
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,420
people from Air era to still have that

1238
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:04,680
that mindset everybody we've talked to

1239
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:08,338
on here from your exact era all have

1240
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:11,779
that same opinion still to this day and

1241
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,779
it's like you know and it is

1242
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,940
I've so I always say that you're old

1243
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:20,579
when you think you know everything

1244
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:23,400
and so I'm glad that like I'm not

1245
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:26,160
confident about this and that every day

1246
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,740
my opinion might be going more towards

1247
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,799
towards yours Matt

1248
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:33,179
um like in a conversation we had

1249
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,300
um

1250
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:38,879
I feel like selfing could be more

1251
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:42,539
problematic or it seems like it you know

1252
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,480
could have more potential for problems

1253
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:47,940
but um so one thing like we're talking

1254
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,280
about Colin from ethos

1255
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:53,700
like he said something and it seems so

1256
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,740
obvious it's like how can I go my whole

1257
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:59,279
life and not think of this

1258
00:50:55,739 --> 00:51:01,500
but when you cross two females

1259
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,260
you have a so much better idea of what

1260
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:08,059
you're gonna get oh for sure and like

1261
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:12,480
trying to judge trying to judge what

1262
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:14,519
male was the right one to use

1263
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,818
it's like

1264
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:19,980
I don't you know

1265
00:51:16,818 --> 00:51:22,920
you have to be very very Adept or very

1266
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,780
very little repetitive yeah

1267
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,300
you have to do things over and over

1268
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:30,240
again you know and then do a lot of

1269
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,579
testing which is almost impossible to do

1270
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:35,338
yeah like how does one grow out

1271
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:38,039
thousands of seeds and preserve every

1272
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:40,139
single clone of everyone trying smoking

1273
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:42,599
every female

1274
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:44,400
yeah I mean we would do

1275
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,780
Gabby and I would do this thing where we

1276
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,240
settled kind of like when we were doing

1277
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,040
the super dog stuff is like I think we

1278
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,279
picked out like our seven or eight

1279
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,440
favorite males based on like books and

1280
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,839
certain traits and then we put them all

1281
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,059
in the room not so usually like the ones

1282
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,159
with the cute butt cheeks yeah we put

1283
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,720
them all in the room and then you know

1284
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,118
they get to a certain point like you

1285
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:08,159
beat them with a with a you know a

1286
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,780
bamboo steak or something like that and

1287
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,399
all the fans are on and you just like

1288
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,319
the pollen would just spread everywhere

1289
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,639
and we're like well it's gonna make the

1290
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:16,500
hunt harder

1291
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:19,500
but since we don't know which male is

1292
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:22,019
doing what did you find was the one we

1293
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:24,179
wanted to just find the one and we

1294
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:25,920
wanted maximum diversity

1295
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:28,558
and that's how that's how you're going

1296
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,300
to get it trying to be so arrogant that

1297
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,900
like you can pick it

1298
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:38,300
that wasn't us you know so like having

1299
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,300
having three or four males in there

1300
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,599
it was a big yeah of yeah finding that

1301
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:47,639
needle needle in the haystack

1302
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:49,740
but we presented it when we gave them to

1303
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:52,078
see they're all going to be good

1304
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:54,899
you know they're two phenomenal plants

1305
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,359
crossed together it's just like they're

1306
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,680
all gonna be good but you know

1307
00:52:57,358 --> 00:52:59,940
you've got to grow a bunch of them and

1308
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:03,058
you're gonna find

1309
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,280
you know a few that are super amazing

1310
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:08,160
yeah

1311
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:10,200
do you remember Gabby the one of the

1312
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,598
final one of the final breedings we did

1313
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,098
I I was trying to I was racking my brain

1314
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,420
for their names and their names really

1315
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:18,240
aren't important I guess but you had

1316
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:21,000
these buddies of yours and they gave us

1317
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:24,078
a version of the black domino and they

1318
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,079
gave us that Warlock

1319
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,919
um and that those two things because we

1320
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,619
did this we when we did the like the one

1321
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,240
of the final super dog greetings we

1322
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:35,220
basically put these like I don't know

1323
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,799
seven or eight different males that we

1324
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:40,379
had picked in there with all of the

1325
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,720
super dog females that we liked and then

1326
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,300
literally like every good cut that we

1327
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,980
could get access to so we had the dog

1328
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,579
and we had the super skunk and we had

1329
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:52,500
the and we had the you know the Mendo p

1330
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:54,359
and we had the Warlock and we had the

1331
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,880
black domino and we had

1332
00:53:54,358 --> 00:54:00,058
I'm got I mean like literally every good

1333
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,740
female cut that him or I had we kind of

1334
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:02,760
gathered them all up and we put them in

1335
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,500
there

1336
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,359
so if you found the one you didn't care

1337
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,920
what made the one you just needed to

1338
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,440
find the one

1339
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,420
yeah I mean knowing what it was knowing

1340
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,818
what it was would have been helpful to

1341
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,039
to try to do more things like that but

1342
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,900
like for instance I don't remember who

1343
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,358
gave me the black domino

1344
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,260
but I remember the reason why we bought

1345
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,598
it

1346
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:27,480
was and I think that was like from

1347
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:30,359
Scentsy seed or yeah we purchased seed

1348
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,420
from from some Seed Company the

1349
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:37,679
description said extremely spider mite

1350
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:39,838
resistant ah yeah you know so the weed

1351
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:42,659
was garbage it really wasn't that good

1352
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:45,599
but if we could make our weed you know

1353
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:47,639
we could cross it with a you know not so

1354
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,460
dog and get a plant that was good

1355
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:52,858
quality and Spider-Man resistant yeah

1356
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,659
that was a good thing yeah you know so

1357
00:54:52,858 --> 00:54:56,279
that's why that that's why that one was

1358
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:59,039
in there what was the other one that you

1359
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,140
mentioned the remember the Warlock they

1360
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:03,838
both came from the same people

1361
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:05,940
I can't remember who gave me them yeah I

1362
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,858
remember the weave yeah they were they

1363
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:10,440
were your buddies neither no yeah

1364
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:12,480
neither was that good

1365
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,818
yeah if you're comparing to chem dog I'd

1366
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,400
imagine not I mean the funny thing is

1367
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:20,460
like there's things where I felt exactly

1368
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,619
how Gabby felt and then years later I

1369
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,900
was like man I was just like discounting

1370
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,640
too many things because they weren't

1371
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,800
like my favorite doesn't mean they

1372
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,500
weren't valuable it just means that like

1373
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,960
they weren't my top couple you know and

1374
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:37,079
as I got older I appreciated different

1375
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,760
qualities of weed you know where in the

1376
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:40,380
beginning it was kind of like

1377
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,359
I don't know you know you wanted that

1378
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,980
weed that tasted amazing and like hit

1379
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,799
you across the head with a two by four

1380
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,940
yeah in a way

1381
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,039
you know

1382
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,139
I I wanted to cover sour a little bit

1383
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:54,119
more uh we talked a little bit about how

1384
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:57,500
you met klopp but what were some of your

1385
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:57,500
impressions of sour

1386
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,440
honestly I didn't have

1387
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:06,900
many till much later on

1388
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,858
when was your first experience I mean

1389
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,019
and

1390
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:11,639
we used to grow a lot of it

1391
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:14,219
you know

1392
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:17,699
um I don't remember exactly what it was

1393
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:21,719
it was one of the deal with it was

1394
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:23,279
it was a highly productive strain of

1395
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:27,959
beautiful weed

1396
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,220
that we could sell easily yeah and you

1397
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,338
know

1398
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:35,338
I was I was on the Discord

1399
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:38,099
and somebody had to remind me or tell me

1400
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:41,639
that most of the people in the Discord

1401
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:45,480
are really small Growers like yeah they

1402
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:47,578
grow in a tent and it's for personal use

1403
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:51,000
and you know

1404
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:54,359
there's a big difference between that

1405
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,440
and even somebody that grows in his

1406
00:56:54,358 --> 00:56:57,960
garage

1407
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:02,159
you know has a 10 lighter in his garage

1408
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:04,920
okay now you do need to make some money

1409
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,539
to pay for your expenses and the whole

1410
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,519
reason why you put up 10 lights in your

1411
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:10,920
garage was to make a little money in the

1412
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:12,780
first place exactly so

1413
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,980
you have to you have to do what's

1414
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,380
marketable

1415
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,818
and that's part of the reason why we

1416
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,740
gave up on the chem dog in the first

1417
00:57:17,818 --> 00:57:21,838
place

1418
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:24,719
yeah well you know when you're getting

1419
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:27,058
such a terrible yield

1420
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,639
you know often this plant like

1421
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:32,339
we couldn't justify like we'd have to

1422
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:33,539
sell it for 50 to 100 more than we would

1423
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:35,880
to sour

1424
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:36,960
yeah we weren't getting that much more

1425
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,140
for it

1426
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,460
you know so like we would keep it and

1427
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:44,699
we'd grow a little bit for our head

1428
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:47,099
stash and like Francis said you know

1429
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:48,719
somebody was growing it and we would all

1430
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:50,700
you know share a little bit of it the

1431
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:53,219
[ __ ] would never get sold because we're

1432
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:56,098
growing such a small amount of it that

1433
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:57,419
you know it didn't make it to the to the

1434
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:00,559
marketplace

1435
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,559
so and

1436
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:05,760
you know

1437
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,160
I want to I want to publicly say this

1438
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,880
sure I love cannabis

1439
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:14,159
should I say that louder I love cannabis

1440
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,420
I want to make a living working in

1441
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:18,058
cannabis

1442
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,559
and to do that it's like a total

1443
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:23,280
different thing

1444
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:25,559
than when you're just trying to grow for

1445
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,200
yourself whether it's in your backyard

1446
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:32,040
or in your tents

1447
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:33,838
you know it is if I was growing just for

1448
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:36,179
myself

1449
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,818
I would just grow ogs

1450
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:41,519
that's really what I like to smoke yeah

1451
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:44,818
you know whether it's the chem dog or

1452
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:47,519
you know other really nice ogs that's

1453
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:49,739
really the palette that I like

1454
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:52,798
yeah you know and actually I should say

1455
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:55,500
this please want to have a diversity

1456
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:58,500
but then there's that always the staple

1457
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,900
that I go to every morning but then I'll

1458
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:04,619
mix in some other stuff like I love

1459
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:08,039
sativa turps I love Citrus turps you

1460
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:10,260
know I you know I love to have a variety

1461
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:11,699
you know so I as I was telling you guys

1462
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:15,240
I smoke these

1463
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:20,039
um soft spots yeah and I have like

1464
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:22,199
30 different types of terpenes some of

1465
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:24,659
them are so aggressive that it's

1466
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:27,058
shocking like you smoke them it's it's

1467
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:30,659
almost offensive like it's too much I

1468
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:34,500
bet but it's still awesome you know yeah

1469
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:38,098
and um so but still I still always in

1470
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,900
towards the OG's is what I like now

1471
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:42,240
right now

1472
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,700
in California in the commercial

1473
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:45,358
Marketplace

1474
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:47,759
um

1475
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:50,460
it's hard to sell a lot of OG

1476
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,099
wow you know and

1477
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,139
it's a first in the

1478
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:57,298
um

1479
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:58,980
that's been going on for a minute you

1480
00:59:57,298 --> 01:00:00,960
know and I think you know you know like

1481
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:02,039
in the Discord people are hating on

1482
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,159
gelato

1483
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:08,639
right oh yeah yeah but [ __ ] that's what

1484
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:10,199
that's what that's what big farms wanna

1485
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,078
buy right now

1486
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:14,159
you know like they're missing the market

1487
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,599
lots of gelato

1488
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,298
yeah

1489
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,859
yeah but so let me tell you a mistake

1490
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:21,059
that I made

1491
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:24,420
okay

1492
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:27,000
having a new Nursery right and I have

1493
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:30,298
all these genetics that are super

1494
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,179
awesome but nobody knows anything about

1495
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:34,199
yeah and so you try to sell people on

1496
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:36,480
this stuff

1497
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,759
but with today's market they need to

1498
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,599
know that they're getting a home run

1499
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:45,180
yeah and so it's so hard to get them to

1500
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:47,640
try something new

1501
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:49,199
you know when right now they can sell

1502
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:52,739
all the Lemon Cherry gelato they can

1503
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:54,419
Grill exactly yeah so after so like when

1504
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:56,098
when I started this I didn't have a

1505
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,780
Lemon Cherry gelato I was like by the

1506
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:01,019
time I get this thing in mass production

1507
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:05,099
it's gonna be like the um

1508
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:06,599
ice cream cake or yeah yeah or you know

1509
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:07,318
like nobody's gonna want this weed

1510
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:10,380
anymore

1511
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:13,019
yeah you know and so but like it's

1512
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:16,220
managed to have lasting power as far as

1513
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:19,980
the demand for the flower and the Clones

1514
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:22,379
so if you're growing a pen lighter

1515
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,719
in your garage

1516
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:27,180
you're really better off you know

1517
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:28,858
growing something that people want

1518
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:30,779
you know and then maybe a small section

1519
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:33,719
of it for your own personal

1520
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:35,519
which is what Francis and I did yeah you

1521
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:37,798
know we we always do a little bit of a

1522
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,780
Ken dog but like we had to go to a

1523
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:42,719
strain that was more productive

1524
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:44,700
and that people wanted to buy it

1525
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,019
you know the funny thing about the term

1526
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:47,039
the super skunk is the most beautiful

1527
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:49,500
weed

1528
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:51,239
like the chem dog is the best the super

1529
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,760
skunk

1530
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:55,199
like I think that weed is the most

1531
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,480
beautiful weed

1532
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,480
I love the way it looks too yeah

1533
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:05,880
yeah it was green and Frosty and it

1534
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,039
smelled like crazy and it was super

1535
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,858
pungent and it's a kind of Aroma that

1536
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:14,639
like is very universally recognized by

1537
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:15,298
Americans as like crazy smelling

1538
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:18,239
um

1539
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:20,880
you know and I also think too that like

1540
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:24,000
to the point that Gabby was making it's

1541
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,519
weird in that if certain strains don't

1542
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,579
leak and they don't get out to a certain

1543
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:32,639
amount of people then the demand for

1544
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:35,039
them can't grow which then makes selling

1545
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,618
it much harder because we would try to

1546
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,358
sell the chem dog and they would be like

1547
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:42,059
ah this is kind of like some like

1548
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,558
backseat OG or something like if how

1549
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:46,380
good could it be if I don't have access

1550
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:49,019
to it yeah and since there was only like

1551
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,760
a few garages or something like that in

1552
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:54,179
our Greenhouse or two that was trying to

1553
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:56,339
grow some it was like Brokers want to

1554
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:58,798
buy a home run

1555
01:02:56,338 --> 01:03:01,019
and to them that wasn't a home run and

1556
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:02,818
it was before the Forum Fame and it was

1557
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:05,579
before it got like a really big name for

1558
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:07,019
itself in public and so people just

1559
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:09,480
wanted things that was going to be

1560
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:12,298
something easy for them to flip

1561
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,519
there's always a device so there's a lot

1562
01:03:12,298 --> 01:03:16,380
of marketing decisions I mean the I was

1563
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:18,420
just gonna say that a lot especially in

1564
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:20,160
Mendo you know in Humboldt and stuff

1565
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,220
like that a lot of times what broker

1566
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:26,298
what Growers grew what was what they

1567
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:29,818
heard the Brokers wanted and was easy

1568
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:31,318
so there was a few years there like for

1569
01:03:29,818 --> 01:03:32,759
instance if we wanted to go back and

1570
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:36,000
talk about

1571
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:38,640
um like uh you know Gabby's store like

1572
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,679
every Big indoor grower in Mendocino

1573
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:43,500
County was growing some kind of purple

1574
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:46,440
Urkel or granddaddy purps or something

1575
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,838
like that right you remember how many

1576
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:52,380
Laytonville indoor gardeners Gabby were

1577
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:54,298
growing miracle and Urkel because it was

1578
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:58,380
easy and the BR and

1579
01:03:54,298 --> 01:04:00,539
Urkel yeah granddaddy perks you know all

1580
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,400
those type of things and and then the

1581
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:03,420
market shifted and it went to sour and

1582
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,338
Kush

1583
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,019
and all those Growers dropped the

1584
01:04:05,338 --> 01:04:08,940
purples and went right into what the

1585
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:11,039
Brokers wanted

1586
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,780
and so there's a you know there's a lot

1587
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,420
there where it's like you might end up

1588
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:16,798
liking a strain but you end up growing a

1589
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,838
small amount of it for you and your

1590
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,838
friends and a lot of times you end up

1591
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:24,480
growing what the you know the majority

1592
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:26,578
of what you grow is what you think the

1593
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,798
Brokers or the market wants to absorb

1594
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:32,640
relatively easily

1595
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:34,380
so here's my new strategy

1596
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:38,279
I want to have

1597
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:41,539
30 percent of exclusive stuff

1598
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:44,579
that you know I'm bringing to the market

1599
01:04:41,539 --> 01:04:46,199
you know one way or another I want to

1600
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:48,660
have 30 percent

1601
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:52,798
of you know

1602
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:55,679
up and coming from known people

1603
01:04:52,798 --> 01:05:00,179
and then 30 percent that only ends up to

1604
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:01,739
90 so 33 of each 33 of stuff that people

1605
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:05,219
want right now

1606
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:07,279
you know that way I can

1607
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:10,739
I can sell people what they want now

1608
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:13,798
while creating a demand for products

1609
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:15,659
under my brand as well as Partnerships

1610
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:17,838
with existing brands

1611
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:21,118
you know but thinking I could do it all

1612
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:23,818
with like exclusive stuff that nobody

1613
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:26,579
knows anything about even though like

1614
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:28,380
it's Fireweed that won the emerald cup

1615
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:30,720
and it's like

1616
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:34,380
that that takes a little bit more today

1617
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:37,919
than it uses it takes a lot it takes a

1618
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:39,660
lot yeah and a lot of legal a lot of

1619
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,619
legal Farms they're sort of drowning

1620
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:46,259
under upfront fees and costs and taxes

1621
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:48,420
and operating expenses so they real

1622
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,619
their margins are a lot of times quite

1623
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,720
tight

1624
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:54,298
um so they really want home runs because

1625
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,818
they're worried about survival

1626
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:58,920
you know um it's not for at least

1627
01:05:56,818 --> 01:06:01,558
especially for you know for most people

1628
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,720
it's not a particularly lucrative time

1629
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:05,819
in cannabis

1630
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:07,919
it's kind of more of like a stay afloat

1631
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:10,739
time

1632
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,480
and the the more it's like that the more

1633
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:15,298
people want certainty

1634
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:18,539
and so that leads to sameness because

1635
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:19,980
people want it hurts the quality it

1636
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:21,298
hurts quality and it hurts diversity

1637
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:24,059
because people are just trying to

1638
01:06:21,298 --> 01:06:25,139
produce an already popular thing at a

1639
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:27,839
low cost

1640
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:30,118
and get somebody to buy it

1641
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:33,480
and it's risky like he was just saying

1642
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:36,119
to try to promote fire that you

1643
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,818
personally think is amazing but the

1644
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:40,858
market might not think that yet and so

1645
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:43,079
do you have the capacity to like

1646
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:44,219
convince them or are you just going to

1647
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:46,920
sit on it

1648
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:49,139
it's different than when your Market was

1649
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:52,019
you were showing your friends your weed

1650
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:55,920
and smoking some with them and you know

1651
01:06:52,019 --> 01:06:58,920
then it was easier now it's like selling

1652
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,139
it in bulk to whether it's a distributor

1653
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,519
or a broker

1654
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:04,199
you know

1655
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:07,199
everybody

1656
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:09,358
it's too far from the final person for

1657
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:10,798
people to be taking these risks

1658
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,199
and so

1659
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:16,679
they're just pumping the gelatos

1660
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:19,078
you know and realistically like

1661
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:22,078
today I think in California

1662
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:25,380
most commercial Farms they have some

1663
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:27,720
type of gelato in their rotation

1664
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:30,960
you know because

1665
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:34,019
the market is calling for it you know

1666
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,059
and the consumer the consumer

1667
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:38,460
I don't want to call them idiots but

1668
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:41,280
they're uneducated

1669
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,920
that's the best word for it well it's

1670
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,440
also to be fair to them Gabby it's also

1671
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,318
hard to make new decisions when you walk

1672
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,358
into a legal store and everything that

1673
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:54,599
you want to check out is in a sealed

1674
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,519
opaque mylar that they can't touch it

1675
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:58,798
smell it smoke it or get excited about

1676
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:00,420
it they just have to like spend a bunch

1677
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:02,460
of money on it and then hope when they

1678
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,680
open it up it's something good

1679
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:06,900
and a lot of the way these mylars are

1680
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:08,759
designed you don't even see the Cannabis

1681
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,318
inside it until you've walked out of the

1682
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:13,140
store and purchased it

1683
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:15,420
they just look at what percentage THC it

1684
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:16,738
is whatever it has the most they take

1685
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:18,899
that

1686
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:21,238
that's what they've been told and then

1687
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:23,579
even if a farmer even if a farmer wants

1688
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:26,099
to take risks it's not just on the

1689
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:28,500
farmer the distro and the dispensary

1690
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,319
also has to be willing to promote that

1691
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,479
to the customer

1692
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:35,640
so the farmer often time doesn't even

1693
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:36,899
have control over whether or not the

1694
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,960
customer is going to get educated

1695
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:42,719
properly on why they think it's so good

1696
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,520
yeah I really really try our best to

1697
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,338
reach out to Bud tenders with this show

1698
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:50,279
as as crazy as it sounds like they're

1699
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:52,019
the the the last point before the

1700
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:54,719
customers and we want them to be at

1701
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:56,819
least be the most educated out of the

1702
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,880
whole ring because they're the ones who

1703
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:01,739
interact the most with the customers

1704
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,440
you know you know what I was I was

1705
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:08,639
remembering Gabby and uh I don't know

1706
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:10,738
this is a totally random story but Gabby

1707
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,660
and I did a project together where we

1708
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:13,559
built this greenhouse on a property he

1709
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:16,079
had

1710
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,940
and we we thought it was we thought it

1711
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:20,880
was a huge Greenhouse at the time but

1712
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:23,639
now it's like laughably small

1713
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:26,219
um but do you remember when we grew uh

1714
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,079
the Maui dude and those buds were so big

1715
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:29,759
we took those pictures where your head

1716
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:31,859
was behind the cola and all you could

1717
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,359
see was your ponytail and like your ears

1718
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:35,060
sticking out because there was these

1719
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,739
giant

1720
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:41,100
High Time the classic High Time

1721
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:42,659
submission photo yeah right yeah you

1722
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:44,579
know that's that's what you know we'd

1723
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:46,559
see in high cons is like a butt in front

1724
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:49,318
of their face because you know we have

1725
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,900
these Giants we had you know we grew I I

1726
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:53,400
mean we had Urkel and Maui and Superdog

1727
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:55,319
and various things in there those things

1728
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:57,179
probably burned in your fire but at some

1729
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:58,859
point we had all these pictures

1730
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:01,100
and that's hard too because I was

1731
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:04,679
thinking about it and it's like before

1732
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:07,260
phones had cameras on them there was so

1733
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:09,359
many less pictures taken there was so

1734
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:11,760
many less you know

1735
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,759
um Gabby had some nice cameras and so we

1736
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,560
took some really cool photos of various

1737
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,840
things that we were doing

1738
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,580
um but all it took was a fire or a bust

1739
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,100
or an accident or something like that

1740
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:24,479
and all that history would be lost

1741
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,340
you know

1742
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:28,799
yeah we got yeah I always remember that

1743
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:30,779
I always remember that like of Gabby's

1744
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,159
head Behind These Maui Buds and all you

1745
01:10:30,779 --> 01:10:34,198
could see was like he used to have this

1746
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,879
really long ponytail and you all you

1747
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:37,859
could see was a part of the ponytail and

1748
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:40,560
maybe the corner of one ear because the

1749
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:43,158
bud was like you know because my ears

1750
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,159
are [ __ ] big

1751
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:48,238
but I mean it was pretty risque I mean

1752
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:51,178
like you know I think like we started on

1753
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:53,579
it the greenhouse was gonna be 20 by 50.

1754
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:57,060
and Gabby thought that was enormous so

1755
01:10:53,579 --> 01:11:00,899
we shrank it to 20 by 30 and he was it

1756
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:02,760
still seemed like it was ballsy

1757
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:05,219
you know within it was on the very top

1758
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,760
of it was on the top of the hill in an

1759
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,760
open field

1760
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:12,238
and you know a few years later that kind

1761
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:15,000
of stuff was a little bit more the norm

1762
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:16,619
but at the time it was coming out of the

1763
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,119
tree lines and it was coming out of the

1764
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:21,599
indoors and it was coming out of these

1765
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:24,599
tiny little scenes and it seemed Giant

1766
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,940
it seemed giant oh yeah for sure

1767
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:30,000
you know in that regard

1768
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:31,319
and uh you know even the idea that you

1769
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,260
could put something like you just said

1770
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:36,059
in like an open field

1771
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:38,039
and you wouldn't get in trouble

1772
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,199
yeah you could actually get away with it

1773
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:42,060
that always blew my mind about up there

1774
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:43,500
in the Emerald Triangle that anybody

1775
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,719
could do that because like you could you

1776
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,560
cannot do that here still there's no way

1777
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:48,600
well

1778
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,340
it's it's it was always a game of cat

1779
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,199
and mouse

1780
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,279
huh

1781
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:55,859
like

1782
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:59,279
I was thinking on it was so there was

1783
01:11:55,859 --> 01:12:01,619
like a generally like well-known or

1784
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,899
maybe it was wrong but we always thought

1785
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:08,219
like as long as you have under a hundred

1786
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:09,420
plants then it becomes the like the feds

1787
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:12,179
aren't going to want to deal with this

1788
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,940
and the local cops they're dealing with

1789
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:16,920
much bigger people so

1790
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:19,079
with the greenhouse

1791
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,760
they could never actually and actually

1792
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:23,340
you're allowed to medically have 25

1793
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,320
plants at this time you know yeah so

1794
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:27,300
with the greenhouse it was like you

1795
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:29,939
can't really see what's in there

1796
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,560
mm-hmm you know and so if you can't see

1797
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:33,178
what's in there

1798
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,880
then

1799
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:37,199
you know we felt a little safer maybe it

1800
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,840
was just you know we were kidding

1801
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,279
ourselves even though you could smell it

1802
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,840
yeah but you can't smell it from a

1803
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,800
helicopter and if you could you wouldn't

1804
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,779
know what you're smelling because

1805
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,179
everyone was growing up there I mean it

1806
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:50,939
was a remote the whole idea was just

1807
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:52,260
like wait keep it keep it kind of small

1808
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:53,819
and

1809
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:56,159
make it not worth

1810
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:58,019
the trouble of that now the issue that

1811
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:00,359
we never thought of is we had a perfect

1812
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:02,480
landing pad over there they could have

1813
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:05,698
like random 10 helicopters up there

1814
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:08,218
right so it wasn't like the Shady like a

1815
01:13:05,698 --> 01:13:09,839
sketchy Mountainside terrain like they

1816
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:12,719
have no place to put it was not like

1817
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,840
they had like a flat mode off [ __ ]

1818
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:18,300
landing pad over there

1819
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,980
it would have been bad I mean yeah I'll

1820
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:21,239
bring this up just because I I just

1821
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,799
thought of it but like when we were

1822
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:24,539
growing the skunk

1823
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,980
you know like that spot we were just

1824
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:27,359
talking about was remote enough it

1825
01:13:25,979 --> 01:13:29,158
really didn't have neighbors that you

1826
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,019
were too worried about but when we were

1827
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:33,719
growing the skunk inside it was kind of

1828
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:36,239
before the carbon filter era it was more

1829
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:39,060
like where you had like uh you know the

1830
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:41,639
uov Nair like the the ozone generators

1831
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:44,820
and stuff and you'd grow that skunk and

1832
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,560
like two weeks before it was done you'd

1833
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:49,619
pull up into your driveway with your

1834
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,679
windows down and you'd be like oh my God

1835
01:13:49,619 --> 01:13:54,479
it smells for 50 yards in every

1836
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:57,420
direction around my house like I'm

1837
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:58,319
slaughtering skunks like I'm gonna get

1838
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:02,100
in trouble

1839
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:03,719
oh my God it reeks and we used to do all

1840
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,340
these things like Caulking and like

1841
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:07,859
venting and trying to do all this

1842
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:11,039
different stuff and it just beat every

1843
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:12,839
effort we had to try to contain the

1844
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:15,420
smell it was uncontainable and so in

1845
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:19,159
some people would get rid of it because

1846
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:22,940
it was too fragrant it like caused Panic

1847
01:14:19,158 --> 01:14:22,939
you know which one was like

1848
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:30,119
the skunk

1849
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:32,698
ah there you go so it was the skunk

1850
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:35,059
yeah correct princess yeah that's what

1851
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:36,960
you're talking about

1852
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,640
anybody else

1853
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,439
he knows that he knows it might have

1854
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,420
been super skunk or skunk

1855
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:44,819
I mean the thing about it is for me is

1856
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:47,819
that I always thought Gabby that like

1857
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:49,559
you know that you know you get when I

1858
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:51,359
when I when you gave me clones it was

1859
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,400
like you gave me the dog and you gave me

1860
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:56,339
and you gave me skunk

1861
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:58,198
and okay just by your stories I've been

1862
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:01,560
thinking about this too

1863
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:04,439
okay and I you know and I know how

1864
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,880
important this is to so many people so I

1865
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:08,238
don't want to get it wrong

1866
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,760
right yeah but

1867
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:14,459
I explicitly remember getting the skunk

1868
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,960
from the dude in Virginia

1869
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:18,779
right

1870
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,840
and that that plant isn't the one that

1871
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:23,880
looks just like the uh

1872
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:27,179
the Scentsy Seed Catalog

1873
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:30,300
and we had gotten we had gotten the

1874
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:34,140
seeds from Scentsy and that's how we got

1875
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:36,420
our original crops that we were uh that

1876
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:38,400
you know then we got the males from to

1877
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:40,739
to make everything else

1878
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:42,119
like super dog and that stuff so that so

1879
01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:44,879
that so that so that's the way I

1880
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:47,340
remember it but as such an important

1881
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,779
part of History you know yeah I'm not

1882
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,880
signing in no but that's David's or

1883
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:52,619
anything like that exactly but that's I

1884
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,420
mean that's all anyone wants you know

1885
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:57,059
what I mean like if you don't quite have

1886
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:59,760
an answer and it's best guess

1887
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:01,980
that's the best guess that's that that's

1888
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,280
just that's more advanced than we were

1889
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:04,279
before

1890
01:16:05,179 --> 01:16:09,719
I will repeat the same story the next

1891
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:11,219
time I speak to you like you said that

1892
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:12,359
somebody was telling the story and every

1893
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:14,399
time they told it it was a little bit

1894
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:17,339
different I don't think I'm gonna tell

1895
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:19,319
it differently no no no no this is this

1896
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:22,260
is a lot different yeah I'm also not

1897
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:23,819
swearing to accuracy you know no of

1898
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:27,320
course I smoke a lot I promise it's a

1899
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:27,319
it's a it's a long-ass time

1900
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:34,679
it's literally decades ago yeah

1901
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:38,819
so yeah let me ask yourself the question

1902
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:41,760
Francis didn't we get the seeds in order

1903
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:45,179
to make the first cross

1904
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,800
yeah here's the thing is that when we

1905
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:48,420
were talking earlier you were like oh we

1906
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:52,020
just used the males

1907
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:53,279
right but we had that problem from the

1908
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:55,920
Census

1909
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:59,039
but we had that one female

1910
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:02,039
right that you that like that you gave

1911
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:04,260
me so I don't know how that one female

1912
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:06,719
came to be because by the time that I

1913
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:11,880
came into it like you gave me the skunk

1914
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:15,960
you gave me skunk and dog the same day

1915
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:19,260
you don't have it anymore correct

1916
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:20,939
I lost it when I got in trouble and you

1917
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,039
know whatever that was anyone give a

1918
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:26,099
[ __ ] it's a gun

1919
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:28,619
because because because one of them one

1920
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:30,600
of them is probably in sour and one of

1921
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:34,079
them is probably in chem dog D and

1922
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:36,539
Diesel and they're very important I

1923
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:39,179
think so I think that's true

1924
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:42,539
but I mean if we don't have it then like

1925
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:44,699
but we have the we have the last two and

1926
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:46,920
we would like to know

1927
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:49,319
kind of which one went where because

1928
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,000
people don't believe us on that on that

1929
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:53,039
little part of it like that's what I

1930
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,399
believed I don't know I don't so what

1931
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:58,500
part is not believed that uh like the

1932
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:01,738
chem dog D it would would have the same

1933
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:05,939
Super Skunk chem 91 connection

1934
01:18:01,738 --> 01:18:07,678
okay they still think it's sisters

1935
01:18:05,939 --> 01:18:10,439
they don't believe us

1936
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,600
yes we disagree with them

1937
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:14,579
probably neither of us will ever be

1938
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,579
proven right or wrong

1939
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:18,920
and we can just enjoy this debate for

1940
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:22,019
the rest of our life

1941
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:25,020
I mean I mean like you don't have ideas

1942
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:27,719
we don't have the source material Beyond

1943
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:30,300
people's words that's true you know to

1944
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:32,158
do it right like we need to have all the

1945
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:35,480
genetics Maybe

1946
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:37,679
right if we had all the genetics and

1947
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:40,379
futuristic technology

1948
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:43,100
right but we we already don't have all

1949
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:45,960
the possible genetics because it's lost

1950
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:48,960
who knows I could I could identify it

1951
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:52,198
from a photo of a bud if somebody was

1952
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:55,619
growing it like the weed is so unique

1953
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:57,658
and it looks just like the [ __ ]

1954
01:18:55,619 --> 01:19:00,359
Scentsy Seed Catalog photo

1955
01:18:57,658 --> 01:19:01,799
like it's the only weed that I've ever

1956
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:04,198
grown

1957
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:06,300
that you could do that with yeah I'll

1958
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:09,000
send you I there there are people that

1959
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,619
think it's I mean this causes all kinds

1960
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,640
of debate because what happens now Gabby

1961
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:17,519
is that people people get get excited

1962
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,560
about old school famous strains and then

1963
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,659
there's opportunists that are like I

1964
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,340
found it now I'm going to sell you

1965
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:24,839
clones for high dollar or I'm gonna make

1966
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,239
a bunch of hybrids with seed and you'll

1967
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:28,679
be able to get it in seed form and so

1968
01:19:27,238 --> 01:19:31,079
there's a bunch of fakes that

1969
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:34,020
proliferate about various stuff there's

1970
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:36,198
all these there's all this Politics the

1971
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:39,120
buyer must be where they must be where

1972
01:19:36,198 --> 01:19:42,000
and like and that's and that's why you

1973
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:45,439
buy seeds from a reliable source like

1974
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,439
riots you'd go right

1975
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:49,738
um because

1976
01:19:47,819 --> 01:19:52,139
if not

1977
01:19:49,738 --> 01:19:54,000
it you know like you know the buyer must

1978
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:56,039
be aware and you know if you're only

1979
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,039
paying you know even a hundred dollars a

1980
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:02,399
pack 150 a pack you know you can roll

1981
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:04,319
the dice when you got situations like

1982
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:05,698
companies that should be remain unnamed

1983
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:07,738
that are selling packs for a thousand

1984
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:09,539
bucks or something like that then you

1985
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:12,238
really want to know you're getting

1986
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:15,060
something I I think genetics are worth

1987
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,500
that much yeah when you're actually

1988
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:19,440
getting

1989
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:21,420
what you're promised if if someone's

1990
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:23,698
saying this is what you're getting this

1991
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:26,039
is what you can expect this is what you

1992
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:28,319
know I think you know genetics can be

1993
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:29,939
worth thousands of dollars

1994
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:31,679
um but

1995
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:33,658
when you're dealing with unreputable

1996
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,859
people and the thing about unreputable

1997
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:37,799
people is

1998
01:20:34,859 --> 01:20:39,420
they get called out pretty quick

1999
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,360
you know like the other person we were

2000
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:43,800

2001
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:46,619
well what happened you know what happens

2002
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:49,320
is Gabby is is that

2003
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:52,319
honestly because we don't have genetic

2004
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:54,840
testing and because we don't have the

2005
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:56,579
guaranteed what we have is we have

2006
01:20:54,840 --> 01:21:00,300
stories

2007
01:20:56,579 --> 01:21:02,100
right and these stories get you know

2008
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,539
like there's people that are like they

2009
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,800
buy into the story and then there's

2010
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:08,279
people that are like that guy's a

2011
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:10,260
scumbag I don't buy his story at all

2012

but Francis you know we answer if we

2013
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:14,100

2014
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:16,460
extremely boring and some people would

2015
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:19,500
have no lives I get it dude that's true

2016

2020
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:29,219
when I would tell when I would tell

2021
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,420
those stories on previous podcasts there

2022
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:32,340

2023
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,899
at me and would be like you don't know

you know I mean I was honestly like even

2032
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:57,899
with that I could help I would rather

2033
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:01,279
people that are just stepping in

2034
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:05,519
what Francis said was pretty accurate

2035
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:07,439
the anything that was inaccurate or not

2036
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:11,100
completely accurate was maybe some

2037
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:13,919
timelines and Minor Details that really

2038
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:16,800
don't change the story much at all

2039
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,739
you know like the the basis of the story

2040
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:22,079
is the same yeah so

2041
01:22:19,738 --> 01:22:24,059
I mean honestly I think you did a better

2042
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:25,920
job than I would have been able to just

2043
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:27,900
because

2044
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,899
you know you've been thinking about it

2045
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:32,460
for longer and you know you've spelled

2046
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:34,079
it out in your mind and possibly on

2047
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:36,198
paper what you thought about it yeah

2048
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:39,000
obsessive yeah

2049
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:41,039
all those stories just come from like a

2050
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,840
million times of like me and Gabby

2051
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:45,779
sitting on a couch somewhere stoned

2052
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,699
shooting the [ __ ] about wheat yeah

2053
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:50,519
that's where it all came from like it

2054
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:52,859
just friendships sharing stories about

2055
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:55,760
this or that or whatever and like that's

2056
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:58,139
honestly like why I believed

2057
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,719
Gabby so much more than some of the

2058
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:03,480
later stuff that came up was because he

2059
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:05,279
didn't have a reason to lie yeah it was

2060
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:07,619
way before the fame it was years and

2061
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:10,800
years before skunk the a got on the

2062
01:23:07,619 --> 01:23:13,140
forums and anybody knew chem dog like

2063
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,719
the the public hadn't heard of it it was

2064
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:17,820
just stories amongst friends

2065
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:20,158
and he was able to it was always the

2066
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:21,179
same story no matter how big right you

2067
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:23,819

2070
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:32,639
know and Gabby and I had a very similar

2071
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:34,679
view on weed in the sense that like we

2072
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:37,980
both liked really good weed and we both

2073
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:40,560
wanted to make better weed if we could

2074
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:43,319
you know I almost did I almost didn't

2075
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:46,260
say it dude but like way back in the day

2076
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:47,759
I liked sativas and like Gabby hated

2077
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:50,640
them because he was like dude I'm so
