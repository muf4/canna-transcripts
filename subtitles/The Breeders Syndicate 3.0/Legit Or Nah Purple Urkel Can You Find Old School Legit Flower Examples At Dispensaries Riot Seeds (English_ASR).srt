00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,179
welcome to breeders Syndicate the only

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,939
cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,739
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,599
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,579
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,379
cookies

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,300
we're the traditional Market

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,679
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,738
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,738
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,200
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,280
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,280
this is the revolution

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,299
hey what's up everyone welcome to legit

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,280
or nah

28
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,658
it's where I go to

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,019
local or otherwise dispensaries

30
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,479
with a goal in mind my only goal is to

31
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,118
see can we find some of these old-school

32
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,658
legit clone only's in modern

33
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,400
dispensaries nowadays can a person that

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,920
is new to the community or within the

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,259
past five to ten years reasonably expect

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,939
to go to a collective

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,000
place an order for one of these old

38
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:35,938
clone only is a flower and either have

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,859
it delivered or grab it there and be

40
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:41,399
pretty confident they're gonna get what

41
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,379
we would have seen originally so you

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,060
know I I really couldn't say either way

43
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,879
my first assumption was always going to

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,500
be that probably that's not going to

45
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,319
happen

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,340
um we've already seen in some cases ogs

47
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,959
that were

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,478
so poorly grown they couldn't be

49
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,419
identified as ogs or oh geez they had

50
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,000
great flavor but were grown kind of will

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,659
grow well but handled chili

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,840
um

53
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,219
today I chose a really weird one for me

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,598
um a lot of you that stick with the show

55
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,739
and have been with the show a long time

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:17,939
know that I have one strain mainly one

57
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:20,640
strain that I regularly won't smoke I

58
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,560
won't smoke hybrids of it more often

59
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,139
than not I mean they're exceptions to

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,080
everything yeah but

61
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:30,839
it flips me out it gives me hella

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,360
anxiety it it just has never hit me

63
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,120
right and I can almost always identify a

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,500
strain with this plant in it because not

65
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,379
just from smell or taste but because

66
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,659
when it hits me sideways I immediately

67
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:44,280
know and I don't know why it is I don't

68
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,919
know why it revolves around this

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,959
specific strain

70
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,399
however I do like breeding with it and

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,200
that's not to say that I have to enjoy

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,060
everything that I breed with smoke wise

73
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,199
but I know it's a valuable tool for

74
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,300
breeding and I know that a lot of other

75
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,759
people enjoy it for their particular

76
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,739
needs you know uh though it may not be

77
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,659
for me I know there is a need for it if

78
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,219
that makes sense

79
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:10,019
um so

80
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:13,378
with that said today we are looking at

81
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,379
purple Urkel

82
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:20,280
what was my semi drum roll anyway

83
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,658
um so yeah I hit up the same place as I

84
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,019
did last time

85
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:26,939
and uh notice there was a purple Urkel

86
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,620
on their menu so I thought there's no

87
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,719
way there's no way because this cut

88
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,719
faded out for so long

89
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,039
very unlikely to see it nowadays so many

90
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,239
things are called purple Urkle but

91
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,060
aren't related anything purple anything

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,620
grapey usually is called Purple Urkel or

93
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,658
you know I've seen lots of green stuff

94
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,799
called Urkel that doesn't remotely

95
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,019
resemble it

96
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:51,200
so when it arrived the first thing I do

97
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,200
when I get Oracle as I you know smell it

98
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:58,019
and there is an unmistakable

99
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,658
grape skunky

100
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,120
undertone to Urkel that is very very

101
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:06,840
hard to replicate GDP has something

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,599
similar but not quite uh Grape Ape

103
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,739
similar not quite vertical is pretty

104
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,798
distinctive

105
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,918
now to me I would probably guess this

106
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,439
was outdoor just based on looking at it

107
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,000
um and I'll toss a picture up here even

108
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,560
though it's probably gonna get us kicked

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,779
into some other

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,959
um category but

111
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:32,638
um it is not again it is about what I

112
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:34,859
would expect from mid Z Collective weed

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,060
right like just is what it is this is

114
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:42,360
what you get so I'm gonna use my trusty

115
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,399
Flour Mill grinder here

116
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,020
and uh

117
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,819
we're gonna do the same thing we did

118
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:51,539
last time and we're going to go ahead

119
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:54,839
and you know get it get a sense for the

120
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,520
flower once ground dry unsmoked see how

121
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,279
it smells there and then we're going to

122
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:02,459
try combustion for flour smoking it that

123
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:05,159
way flavor obsessing high and then we're

124
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:08,939
going to go to uh the rip which is

125
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,080
essentially Vape vaping vaporizing

126
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,060
um

127
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,519
yeah and that that seems to give me the

128
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,280
most well-rounded idea of strains

129
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,258
they're um

130
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,359
at least grows of strains I should say

131
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,860
specific rows of specific strains

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
because you can't really judge a whole

133
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,819
strain by one grow

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,220
I'm sure most of you know that by now

135
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,560
but just in case you don't that's

136
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,600
something that you want to really pay

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,180
attention to you know a lot of people

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,460
they'll go get a cut from a collective

139
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,840
and then you know someone will commented

140
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,459
about online it'll be like yeah I agree

141
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,619
that it sucks

142
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:45,000
it sucked and realistically they don't

143
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,220
even know if they grew the same damn cut

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,079
they're just assuming and maybe it was

145
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,460
just not adapted to their environment

146
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,800
maybe they aren't even the best grower

147
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,180
you know you have to take all that [ __ ]

148
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,819
into account when you hear people's

149
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,478
opinions online about stuff but

150
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:04,099
all right here we go flower Mill

151
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:04,099
Urkel little Urkel nugs

152
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,379
that um with the outdoor just the look

153
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,759
of it too but the pricing also told me

154
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,560
there's a good damn chance this is

155
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,479
outdoor one thing I was surprised about

156
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,000
though is that it had it had decent

157
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,258
smell and um I know outdoor people are

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,240
like of course it dude it was [ __ ]

159
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,560
out or that you know like I just don't

160
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,000
have that experience without

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,000
actual um

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,560
I smoked a lot of outdoor too so just I

163
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,019
just don't have that experience with it

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,019
anyway here we go first smell ground

165
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:41,360
man that's such a rich grape sweet but

166
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,360
there hold on

167
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,239
there's another smell in there that I've

168
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,159
never really paid attention to

169
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,819
this flower Mill is great for smelling

170
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,819
ground flour

171
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,979
gummy bear front

172
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:01,019
white gummy bear front great back

173
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:02,758
that's the smell white gummy bear front

174
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,379
great back

175
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,819
and some skunkiness is there and it

176
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,918
always will be

177
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,500
um I've talked about it before skunk uh

178
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,939
I'm sorry purple Urkle and poodle nuts

179
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,300
specifically which is very irkal

180
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:17,038
dominant have the strongest skunk smell

181
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,360
and veg that I've ever smelled and you

182
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,939
know I always hear people like ah rub

183
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,199
this is yeah it's bro it's so skunky it

184
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,459
makes me skunky and that's not

185
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,160
necessarily again it doesn't translate

186
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,258
like that's not how [ __ ] works but it is

187
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,479
duly noted you know like something to

188
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,098
note like when something has such a

189
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,318
strong distinctive smell and veg you can

190
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,240
identify it in veg later usually so yeah

191
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
and it has it has very specific growing

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,660
trade Circle likes to grow very bushy

193
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:44,519
short squat uh needs a long veg time

194
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,960
broadleaf sometimes Outdoors though it

195
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,620
could go more narrow looking and

196
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,620
surprises people

197
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:55,259
yeah white gummy bear front great back

198
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,418
and that's the first time I've ever like

199
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,699
picked up the gummy bear part or even

200
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:01,799
thought of to say that but like it just

201
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,919
hit me all at once what that smells to

202
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,259
me uh is on this specific row of it I'm

203
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,359
sure people argue with me that they've

204
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,038
grown all the real urkles on Earth and

205
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,080
they all have a different statement but

206
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,918
you know

207
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,139
also

208
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,779
just to be sure because I was pretty

209
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,780
sure that I knew that this was going to

210
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,279
be legitimate Urkle but I ran it by CSI

211
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:24,598
as well and granted it's hard to tell

212
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,399
legitimacy

213
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,538
any you know what I mean but we're

214
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,698
pretty sure

215
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,918
that this is Urkel and um I trust his

216
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,658
opinion on Oracle much more than mine

217
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,240
I have experience with it but he has

218
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:37,860
more experience with it

219
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,538
and no matter how much experience you

220
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,580
have with something if someone has more

221
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:43,199
experience with it

222
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,839
and they're intelligent

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,360
it's always best to uh double check

224
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,160
yourself check your uh check your own

225
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,180
bias

226
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,179
all right so

227
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,439
just for y'all

228
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm gonna give myself a goddamn panic

229
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,240
attack on camera

230
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,040
um

231
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,959
like maybe not Maybe not maybe it's

232
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,079
maybe my body chemistry has changed my

233
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,579
brain chemistry's changed

234
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,019
um but I've actually been dreading this

235
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,759
review quite a bit because of it and um

236
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,000
yeah that's another thing that I did

237
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:24,000
want to address in this a lot of males

238
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,159
specifically are very

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
uh what's the word

240
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,838
ashamed

241
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,000
to talk about when when cannabis sends

242
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,240
them into dark holes or dark places

243
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,639
right like it it some people take that

244
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,560
as a oh man you ain't got no [ __ ]

245
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,319
tolerance bro you ain't got no tolerance

246
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,239
you must be a noob if you did that [ __ ]

247
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,500
um and you know like I was one of those

248
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,419
dudes when I was young that would say

249
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,480
[ __ ] like that and just like huh watch

250
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:54,059
him freak out and chairs

251
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,100
but as you as a man especially I can

252
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,659
come in as a man you know

253
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,420
um I mean maybe some people would call

254
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:02,399
me that but as a male

255
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,620
um

256
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,600
your hormones can change

257
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,278
as you get older

258
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,379
um things that never really affected me

259
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,000
like this when I was young but after I

260
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,100
quit hard drugs

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,860
something changed in my brain chemistry

262
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,740
I feel like and certain

263
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,519
things could send me on really really

264
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:26,339
painful dark mental paths

265
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:30,659
cannabis is not a cure-all it is not a

266
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:33,120
catch-all it is not the the snake oil

267
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:34,019
that will heal all that ails you

268
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,940
um

269
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,759
it's one of my main points for this

270
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,140
season in explaining about the name game

271
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:45,659
and why it's so important to

272
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,799
find a way to educate the end user that

273
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:50,879
isn't necessarily into growing or

274
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:54,120
strains that they cannot rely on

275
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,039
collectives or dispensaries for their

276
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,539
reliable

277
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,259
medicine

278
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,879
none of that is seems to be repetitive

279
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,679
um I just had a recent experience and

280
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,899
I'm going to do a second review on the

281
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,719
Louis OG because I ordered a second

282
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:14,100
batch from the same place a week later

283
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,379
and yeah I mean as you would expect and

284
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,620
I'll talk about an interview

285
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:22,559
there's more to talk about you know so

286
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,620
just you cannot reliably

287
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:29,518
hope that your Collective will have the

288
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,339
same thing in the same packaging twice

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,440
and God forbid you're someone like me

290
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,720
that you know goes and picks up a

291
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,079
blueberry and they switched it out for

292
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,079
because

293
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,958
that can send people I could have

294
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,940
serious consequences depending on where

295
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,838
people are at mentally how their day is

296
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,060
gone uh what's going on in their lives

297
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,100
uh I just don't think people take it

298
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,139
serious enough and and

299
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,120
you know I people left all the time for

300
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,259
houses I take this yeah it's goofy it's

301
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,879
real goofy there's not a lot of people

302
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,319
this far into stranger that care this

303
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,659
much about history or provenance or any

304
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,000
of that but the fact is

305
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:10,500
people rely on this for medicine

306
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,559
and if they can't rely on it for that

307
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:17,339
it can end up hurting them

308
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:18,778
so yeah that's the overall reaching

309
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,980
point with a lot of what I'm trying to

310
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,078
illustrate

311
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,000
however

312
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,219
this is Urkel I think it's Circle and

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,899
we're about to find out if my brain

314
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,180
chemistry changed in a few years since

315
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,559
I've smoked it so here we go let me try

316
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:34,078
combustion first see if we can get a

317
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:36,539
good flavor profile

318
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,719
um scent profile already gone over it I

319
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:42,360
I like white gummy bear grape

320
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,940
yes

321
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,419
uh here we go and of course

322
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,440
using my breeder Syndicate branded piece

323
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:55,199
from C2 Custom Creations Last by c2.com

324
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,639
I trust no one else for my glass ever

325
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,339
ever

326
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,959
um and that was before we even sponsored

327
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,540
or even agreed to do this I agreed to do

328
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,659
this because I loved their glass and uh

329
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:08,278
I only work with products I stand by so

330
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:12,319
you know how that goes

331
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:17,000
here we go do I wanna do I want me where

332
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,000
all right yeah well um

333
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,940
foreign

334
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,500
with combustion it's really hard to

335
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,200
identify that flavor it's great there's

336
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,600
a lot of earthy flavor

337
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,560
technical not a lot of sweet

338
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,560
um not combustion

339
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,360
where's that flavor

340
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:19,078
it's just earthy like

341
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,180
Urkel and granted this

342
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:23,278
this is an outdoor grow Urkel can be

343
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:24,719
very flavorful indoor I don't get the

344
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,958
same flavor profile that I'm used to

345
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,720
with Urkel since there the looks there

346
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,518
I'll know in probably five minutes with

347
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,639
the highs there that I'm used to but

348
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,759
yeah the flavor is lacking on that so

349
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,680
we're gonna try the old uh

350
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,659
the Old Rip Tech now I'll go over this

351
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,159
again for the people that haven't seen

352
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:48,958
uh

353
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:51,659
uh view one I'm using the Writ master

354
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,359
rip Tech wand

355
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:56,759
it is a vape wand that uses there's a

356
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,240
hole in the bottom it sits on top of a

357
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,939
bowl this uh grommet plugs it

358
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,240
creates an air suction thing and there

359
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,839
is holes on this side right here and

360
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,299
this side it creates a Vortex of air of

361
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,180
hot air that goes through the bowl this

362
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:17,578
never makes contact with the bud and uh

363
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,739
yeah there is a heat

364
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:21,120
setting part right here as you can see I

365
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,339
mark it with the Sharpie where I liked

366
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,519
it and that tends to be perfect for all

367
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:30,120
yeah this is uh my favorite my favorite

368
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:33,839
device ever for uh smoking for for

369
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,000
really assessing Terps hi it doesn't

370
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,760
kill all the volatile Terps it usually

371
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,379
just get burnt off through combustion

372
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,360
um but yeah you can taste a lot of sweet

373
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,278
notes that you normally wouldn't taste

374
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,500
um like blueberry tastes like sugary

375
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,480
sweet blueberry and you would never

376
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,919
taste that through your combustion

377
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,019
anyway

378
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,240
here we go

379
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,459
this is I just wish it was more portable

380
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,060
because this gets in the way pretty hard

381
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,059
all right

382
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:05,339
and the idea is you let this sit on

383
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:08,040
there for five to ten seconds

384
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,980
heated up a little bit

385
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:13,919
and then you hit slow to allow

386
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:17,300
everything to kind of slowly dry in

387
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,299
so I always exhale first

388
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:41,039
okay

389
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,639
there's the flavor there's the grape

390
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,639
oh yeah

391
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,619
you know what's funny is the sweetness

392
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:51,778
hit the back of my throat as opposed to

393
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,179
like the front of my tongue I can really

394
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,860
taste it in the back of my throat that

395
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,359
is bizarre

396
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,199
um definitely

397
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,839
great flavor all day through this

398
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,480
and of course like

399
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,759
there's always a really soft

400
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,400
flavor that comes through with the rip

401
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,740
and it's very hard to explain but it's a

402
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,839
soft flavor

403
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,558
if that makes any sense

404
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,240
um but it's it's with every plant so I

405
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,859
think that I mean every cannabis plant

406
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,078
so I think that that's just the flavor

407
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,818
of cannabis when you use this stuff but

408
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,039
the grape is the uh

409
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:32,480
overall flavor

410
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,480
let's impressive through this

411
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,400
hey Yep this is our goal this is [ __ ]

412
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,538
integral so

413
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:48,419
yeah uh even at a Bakersfield dispensary

414
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:50,220
randomly like I didn't choose other

415
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,440
I didn't like go through choose several

416
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,058
oracles find one that was real and just

417
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,200
go with that and say hey I found one

418
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:57,779
that's real

419
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,319
this is the first one I went with

420
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:04,859
I was positive that it was not going to

421
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:07,200
be legit one price two Rarity

422
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:09,479
three age most people got rid of Urkel

423
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,700
most people thought they had Urkel had

424
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,660
something else in the first place

425
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,380
um

426
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:20,100
so yeah I I am I'm shocked uh Highway 99

427
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,020
collective in Bakersfield California

428
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,519
decent job

429
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,160
um I don't know who you're sourcing this

430
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,960
from and I'm not going to ask but

431
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,640
they did a good job

432
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,798
um shout out to them

433
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,419
um yeah I I do think it's outdoor but

434
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,038
the price reflected that so it's not

435
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,460
like anything crazy

436
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,558
uh what else would I add on to this

437
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,298
if you have a brain chemistry that

438
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,220
really really likes blueberry and it

439
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,900
brings you a lot of anti-anxiety type

440
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,538
High

441
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,419
you might be the type of person that

442
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:53,400
responds to Urkel the way I do and it

443
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,440
takes a lot to keep it together and just

444
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,298
be like

445
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,298
you know what I mean like it'll put you

446
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:03,538
in a a very awkward position some people

447
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:05,220
like that some people especially some of

448
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,679
my elders in the community they love

449
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,140
what they call roller coaster weed which

450
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:15,200
is something that gives them the fear of

451
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,200
God you know where at the top then goes

452
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,620
those are the kind of highs I run away

453
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:24,058
from anyway

454
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:26,459
um yeah I hope you enjoy these reviews

455
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:28,379
um I just started out kind of wondering

456
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,019
for myself if these things were out

457
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,059
there also while trying to

458
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,679
learn about some of this new stuff that

459
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,660
neither me or any of my friends grow

460
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,720
right like some of the newer hype stuff

461
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,220
The Lemon Cherry gelato the rs11 stuff

462
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,000
like that

463
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,558
um

464
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,940
and I figured while I was already doing

465
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,440
that I wonder if any of these old

466
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,720
strains that I love are still out there

467
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,820
can these people reliably get them that

468
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,579
aren't experienced with them can they

469
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:56,038
expect to get them so

470
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,599
um I'm gonna keep doing it I think yeah

471
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,099
you guys seem to like some people seem

472
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,579
to like it some people seem to hate it

473
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:04,759
and uh that's great because if you hate

474
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:07,859
it leave comments you know

475
