00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,919
welcome to breeders syndicate where we

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,359
explore the history of a clandestine

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,800
scene through the eyes of the folks who

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,320
lived it i'm matthew owner of riot seeds

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,719
i'll occasionally be joined by my

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
co-host not-so-dog breeder and grower

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,839
from mendocino

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,839
welcome to the underground

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:32,238
it's interesting and like the hash thing

11
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:35,280
um you know the hash thing is is kind of

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,320
cool because you can we can widen it out

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
a little bit

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,719
in the sense of um you know and talk

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,879
about like some traditional weed

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,079
cultures yeah because there is a real

17
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:49,280
divide in weed cultures between cultures

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,000
that grew weed primarily to make hashish

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,879
sure uh and cultures that grew weed

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
primarily to smoke weed

21
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,558
you know yeah um and you know that that

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,558
aspect and those choices made

23
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,920
um made a lot of differences for people

24
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:07,679
and now for a long time america

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
one of the benefits of america is that

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,799
we're isolated from everywhere we have

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,040
like big oceans

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,439
yeah on either side and all that but

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,400
we're very far away from the hash

30
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,279
culture

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,240
yeah right so traditionally

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,400
uh all the best hash sort of stays local

33
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,798
uh and then some small amount of it

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,359
would go to europe right yeah

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,799
and what america typically got

36
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:35,920
was uh the b and c grade yeah you know

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,439
so a lot of times americans especially

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,519
canadians are a little different

39
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,199
canadians had some better connections

40
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,200
and some better smuggling that happened

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,478
up there yeah so they sometimes saw a

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,159
little bit better of a grade but

43
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,039
americans especially

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,359
um

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
you know they uh we got the shaft as far

46
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,040
as high grade

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,560
so a lot of people think of

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,560
um imagine if your view of kind bud was

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
like beasters

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,439
yeah and that's what you thought it was

51
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,438
because that's the only thing you've

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,118
experienced a lot of people if you

53
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,559
haven't been to europe and you haven't

54
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,959
and you haven't and you haven't been

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,719
tied into those communities right yeah

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,319
you probably haven't smoked the best of

57
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,000
the best

58
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,000
and so there's a lot of hash people in

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,080
america that think like the last 10 or

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,318
14 years of sort of like the hash

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,879
revolution that's happened over here

62
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,479
that they have the best hash by far that

63
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,000
they blow away all the traditional

64
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,679
cultures by far

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,759
and that they're kind of on the cutting

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
edge and they've changed the game

67
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,039
and they figured it out nobody else did

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,439
yeah

69
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,359
right which is pretty far from the case

70
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,759
yeah you know so it's like a lot of

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,760
those things where um

72
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,199
you know we can we can kind of riff on

73
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,759
that for a little bit

74
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,919
um so maybe you can kind of talk we can

75
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,280
we can start like maybe we'll we'll

76
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,079
we'll start from the beginning where

77
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
it's like the hash culture sort of comes

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
from

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,159
the

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
i would say the the near east and the

81
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,158
middle east yeah i would say indian

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,719
indian culture india

83
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,719
chinese maybe yeah i mean and and

84
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,239
probably the old probably the oldest way

85
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,840
to smoke cannabis

86
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,319
uh before they even figured out how to

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,800
smoke flour besides like burning flowers

88
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,919
on braziers or something yeah is the

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
hand rub

90
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:22,799
yeah you know um

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,719
and that india pakistan afghanistan iran

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
the middle east you can go into like

93
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,519
lebanon and israel in those areas and

94
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,079
you can go through north africa all the

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
way to morocco and that's sort of hash

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
culture yeah

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
right

98
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,399
um in terms of like people grew weed

99
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,199
just make to turn weed into hash yeah

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
where

101
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,039
you start getting into like

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
um southeast asia

103
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,359
uh and you know and especially the new

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
world like mexico and colombia and

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,480
panama and these type of places in

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,318
africa

107
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,959
they mostly smoke wheat

108
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,039
yeah and you know um one that that

109
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,799
caught me off guard was nepal

110
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,199
i always think of like nepalese temple

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,239
balls and that kind of hash culture but

112
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,598
if i remember correctly when i was

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,599
studying it most of it was a flower

114
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,119
culture it was most it was it was a

115
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,479
little bit of both yeah you know um but

116
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
you know and so

117
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,439
to be to perfectly honest like when i

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,199
started going to amsterdam um i i went

119
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,040
there in search of seats

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,040
yeah you know and then i started getting

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,560
introduced to hash and

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
uh you know i smoked a bunch of stuff

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,478
but in the coffee shops

124
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,160
uh it's a lot like you know it's a lot

125
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:34,399
like dispensaries or whatever there's a

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,320
wide variety yeah of mids and junk and

127
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,719
really good and pretty decent and stuff

128
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,959
and it wasn't until i met collectors

129
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,479
yeah um that started explaining to me

130
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,918
like how it all worked

131
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,319
yeah right

132
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,000
um and so

133
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,079
there's an aspect maybe we maybe i could

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,680
talk for a minute about before we talk

135
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,399
about the regional differences for a

136
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,240
second maybe i could talk about like

137
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,239
uh something that we chat about often

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,560
which is the vast difference between how

139
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,478
traditional hash is made

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,160
um and how

141
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,680
american hash is made yeah right so the

142
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,680
american hash

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,160
uh the way it's made um in most cases

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,319
is you it's it's you know a lot of times

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,639
it's called single source right

146
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,439
it's a single clone

147
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,079
right

148
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,560
um grown in either depths or outdoor or

149
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,639
indoor or whatever and that single clone

150
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,800
is usually you know dried or fresh

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,600
frozen and then it's you know it's

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,600
processed um and then it's usually

153
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,520
refrigerated or frozen right away or

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,639
stored well until use and it's used

155
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,839
pretty quickly

156
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,960
yeah right

157
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,599
where in traditional hash culture

158
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,959
you're harvesting a field of seeds

159
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,160
yeah right so you know in america it's

160
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,159
like oh i'm going to pull down this

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,880
greenhouse and it's all for lack of a

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,520
better it's all gmo yeah it's all the

163
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:59,279
same cut you know same terpene profile

164
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,079
same cbd cbn thc all that it's the same

165
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,239
thing

166
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,159
yeah but if you're if you're harvesting

167
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,439
it from any other region you're going to

168
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,319
get the full range of expression of that

169
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,000
wine

170
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
yeah because they're harvesting

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,839
thousands of sisters yeah

172
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,638
and then they're processing those

173
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,318
sisters and unlike unlike mo if you're

174
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,240
if you're talking about like dry sift

175
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
and stuff like that they tend to let

176
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
that hash age

177
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,758
yeah

178
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,918
on the plant for a number of months

179
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,879
and then when it's cold and bone dry

180
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,839
they start a sifting process yeah

181
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,519
right and then from that sifting process

182
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,679
um you know then they make it into

183
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,799
various grades

184
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,038
and then they press it right so that's

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
not done in america at all

186
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,560
all of your all of your terp [ __ ] all of

187
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,520
your whether it's fresh frozen or it's

188
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,680
you know bho or it's it's uh

189
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,879
you know uh whatever extraction you're

190
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,720
doing it's usually single source yeah

191
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,399
and it's not aged usually the plant is

192
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,840
taken down fresh

193
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,959
and as soon as they can make the hash

194
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,879
they make the hash yeah right and so

195
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,478
you know i'm not exactly the expert on

196
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,199
the science or whatever but definitely

197
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,800
aging it creates you know it it

198
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
transfers things

199
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,520
from one to the other right certain

200
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,519
amounts of cbn or cbd or this or that or

201
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,159
whatever is converted into other

202
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,439
bioactives what not and then on top of

203
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,520
that when

204
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,279
uh we've wanted to get uh

205
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,439
our buddy bodhi on here for a long time

206
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,478
to do like a hippie hashish trail kind

207
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,319
of episode

208
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,519
yeah and so we might get more in depth

209
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
with that but

210
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,079
when

211
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,680
essentially when europeans and white

212
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,879
people first started going to the hash

213
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,639
regions and looking for export

214
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,759
most hash there was a lot of hash that

215
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,240
was one two three years old

216
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,720
yeah you know a lot of the best hashish

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,319
uh wasn't smoked until it was over a

218
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,919
year or two years old

219
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,039
yikes

220
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,799
right i guess it's just different

221
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,399
climate though you know it was different

222
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,038
climate

223
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,038
it was stored very differently you know

224
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,199
and they just thought that it was it was

225
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,000
not like it wasn't ready yet

226
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,879
yeah

227
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,439
you know and so um and what's

228
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,280
interesting about this is that if you go

229
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,360
to amsterdam

230
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,598
and you have all these people that have

231
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
all the same access to all the same tech

232
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,199
that we do here yeah as far as

233
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,439
extracting modern cultivars for hashish

234
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,639
and all the hash heads over there

235
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,120
will tell you

236
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,759
that the best hash that they smoke is

237
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,599
the top import

238
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,680
they can use pollinators they can use

239
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,879
tumblers they can fresh froze and freeze

240
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,679
dry and microplane and do all the tricks

241
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,519
that people win awards with over here

242
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,639
yeah and they still think that hash is

243
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,000
inferior in quality and effect

244
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,278
to the best of the best import

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
right

246
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,240
and

247
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,399
you know but in america we all think

248
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,839
that our [ __ ] is the best [ __ ] ever

249
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
of course

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,920
basically as soon as we invented the

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,560
nail and we invented some modern ways of

252
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,639
hash smoking in 09 you know 2010 2011

253
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,278
yeah that that was the revolution

254
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,000
and hash went from shitty to amazing

255
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,399
yeah right now it's true that most

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,879
americans got shitty hash and it's also

257
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
true that when all these white people

258
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,559
and all these europeans and all these

259
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
americans and and brotherhood of eternal

260
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,639
love and all these [ __ ] started

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,480
coming to these regions to look for hash

262
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,439
and started offering crazy amounts of

263
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
money

264
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
yeah the quality went way down yeah

265
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,320
people started adulterating it people

266
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,199
started middlemen started making it

267
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,959
worse

268
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,480
people wanted volume because there was

269
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,079
so much demand

270
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,600
right so a lot of times the best stuff

271
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,519
never leaves

272
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,278
yeah even like even my friends in

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,200
amsterdam who are very tied in

274
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,559
them getting the best of the best is

275
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,320
really hard

276
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,838
i would imagine so and they and they

277
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
savor it

278
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,560
right they absolutely savor it and they

279
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,160
hold on to it and it never makes the you

280
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,639
know i almost said clubs it never it

281
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,879
almost never makes the the coffee shops

282
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,159
yeah because it's all traded amongst

283
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,399
each other

284
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,958
yeah right it's all bought and sold that

285
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,600
kind of grade you kind of have to know

286
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,759
someone yeah it's no different than like

287
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,920
if you if for to mention him again if

288
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,838
bodhi gave out some like 14 week amazing

289
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,599
sativa you probably wouldn't be able to

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,600
buy it from the cookie store

291
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,839
yeah well you'd have to have a home

292
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,399
you'd have to have a homie well well

293
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,480
maybe now maybe but but even someone

294
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,639
even something that takes that long yeah

295
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
yeah for sure you know what i mean like

296
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,159
in europe you know there's there's still

297
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,160
like i have a buddy over there right now

298
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,679
that was texting me on what to get

299
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,919
matt i didn't tell you this but he just

300
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:50,958
bought some cg 13. and some c5 and some

301
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,199
and some a5 from over there you know

302
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,719
um and those you know those are 15 16

303
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,040
weak strings

304
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,000
yeah that's you that's unheard of to get

305
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,879
in a dispensary over here yeah that's

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
wild

307
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,200
but over there it's their bread and

308
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
butter

309
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,360
yeah you know so you can find that stuff

310
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,759
so the biggest just to reiterate before

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,839
we get too off track um

312
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,679
the biggest difference is between

313
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,880
american hash and like the best

314
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,838
traditional

315
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,720
is

316
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,200
uh

317
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,160
you know the what i was told by the the

318
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,320
amsterdam crews is like the best stuff

319
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,958
is made in traditional regions

320
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,040
but westerners help them

321
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,359
to make sure that the purity and the

322
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,000
process is amazing

323
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,639
okay does that make sense so making

324
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,879
their technique more purifying making

325
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,120
making sure that the cl the cleanliness

326
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,600
you know and the technique and all that

327
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,278
is good screens and everything like that

328
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,680
and you know people one of the reasons

329
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,159
why people ask this is people asked

330
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,599
about temple balls right these nepalese

331
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,120
temple balls

332
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,278
and i will say that these nepalese

333
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
temple balls that i smoked from my buddy

334
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,159
was some of the best hash i've ever

335
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,519
smoked in my life

336
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:03,919
okay and it's interesting because a lot

337
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
of people over there feel that way yeah

338
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,399
right

339
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,720
and they feel that like

340
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,559
there's something to the fact that like

341
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,278
a lot of this stuff is being grown at

342
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,078
six or seven or eight thousand feet

343
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,320
yeah

344
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,559
right where the air is thinner

345
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,399
and there's more uv

346
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,319
and maybe that leads to a different type

347
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,839
of psychoactive or a different type of

348
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,800
thc production

349
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,200
sure

350
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,078
you know and so they would say that like

351
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,600
you know uh our buddy yo sammy

352
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,359
you know would say i don't care what

353
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
modern cultivar you have i don't care

354
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,879
what amazing cut you think you have or

355
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,559
how pure you make it

356
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,919
you know it shits the bed next to the

357
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,838
best typical

358
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,559
yeah like if you can get the best of the

359
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,240
best he's like just in flavor and effect

360
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,518
yeah right an effect is hard to say

361
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,519
because it's invisible right yeah so

362
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,679
we got used to making all these modern

363
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,639
cultivars and thinking that like

364
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,399
thousands of years of hash culture

365
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
we just beat

366
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,559
yeah because we're a little cleaner

367
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,759
yeah because we have a little bit better

368
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,278
and we have a little bit we have some

369
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,519
machinery and we're a little bit better

370
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,879
processed but like old-timers will tell

371
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
you that like they think that putting

372
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,600
your hash in the in the in the fridge

373
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,559
ruins it

374
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,399
yeah

375
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,199
and you know what what what's weird

376
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,958
about the nepalese stuff is i will say

377
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,639
that

378
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,439
and this isn't a plug on it or whatever

379
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,759
but anything i've ever smelled

380
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,279
that smelled like the mendo perps that i

381
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,519
cracked yeah had the mendo perps in it

382
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,240
yeah in the sense that like i've never

383
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,240
smelled that terpene profile from any

384
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
other plant that wasn't it

385
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,919
yeah

386
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,680
unless it was related to it in the sense

387
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,078
that like someone bred with it or it was

388
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:48,159
it was an ancestor of that right yeah

389
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:49,838
except these temple balls that i smoked

390
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,278
and they smelled when you were burning

391
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,639
them they smelled like you were burning

392
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,399
mendo perps

393
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,000
that's interesting now you know does

394
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,320
that mean that like the mendo p is

395
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
nepalese i don't know you know but or

396
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,399
does it mean that it just evoked that

397
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,680
terpene profile yeah

398
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,198
you know

399
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,599
i i can't say

400
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,919
um but all those guys over there what's

401
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,079
crazy is that um

402
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,039
all those hash heads over there they

403
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,599
grow all kinds of phenomenal weed

404
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,599
and they sell all that weed to buy the

405
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,399
best hash they can get

406
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,159
yeah

407
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,679
you know like somebody like somebody

408
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,360
like you know uh when you were

409
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,719
interviewing uh uh uh camara and and red

410
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
you know yeah

411
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,720
i mean he was saying that like you know

412
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,120
he's never even seen sam skunk man smoke

413
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,120
weed yeah

414
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,720
that you know the the top people over

415
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,519
there are hershey's

416
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,759
yeah

417
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
you know they smoke hatch they're resin

418
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,480
farmers

419
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,959
makes sense you know that's what they're

420
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,039
after they're after a resin yeah

421
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,239
and so you know we could widen that out

422
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,319
for a little bit

423
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,278
and talk about how

424
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,480
um

425
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,159
you know

426
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,639
this is like a totally different tangent

427
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,919
or whatever but um

428
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,320
when

429
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,679
americans started smoking weed

430
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,440
we were a flower culture

431
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,838
we were getting weed from mexico and

432
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,920
panama and jamaica and colombia and all

433
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,600
these things and we were getting bricked

434
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,599
um and we were getting you know we were

435
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
getting bricked of this stuff

436
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,480
and we started blending them with

437
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,320
afghans because of prohibition right

438
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,480
and it's super common and matt can speak

439
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,278
on this too but

440
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,680
most of the weed smokers back then

441
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,278
were very disappointed in the smoke of

442
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,078
the afghans

443
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,600
yeah

444
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,799
they didn't really like the high and

445
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,759
they didn't really like the way it

446
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,319
burned

447
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,399
yeah i mean it was so vastly different

448
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
than what they were used to

449
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,000
compared to compared to sativas because

450
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,519
those sativas have been have been bred

451
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,320
for smoking yeah they were bred for they

452
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,399
were bred to be burned as flour yeah you

453
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,079
know where i mean i i told this before

454
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,600
but there's this funny story of when sam

455
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,519
skunk man was in

456
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,278
um was in afghanistan and he was

457
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,278
searching for seeds

458
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,278
right and so he was asking these

459
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,559
warlords for seeds

460
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,039
for flour

461
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,439
you know and they looked at him

462
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,240
and they said you know smoking flowers

463
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,880
for women and slaves

464
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,720
right are you a woman or a slave yeah

465
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,958
and he had to convince them

466
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,720
that he was a man and he just wanted

467
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,198
them so he could grow his own

468
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,079
flower at home and make resin

469
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,039
i wonder if he pulled out his wiener

470
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,919
you know

471
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,919
uh and let me prove it you know but to

472
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,719
them it was like that that was that was

473
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,679
the thing the flower was a waste product

474
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,759
yeah

475
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,719
you know peasants and women slaves and

476
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,320
women smoked smoked flour real men

477
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,320
smoked hash

478
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
that was their culture so

479
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,240
obviously you don't care how flour burns

480
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,919
and you don't care how the flower

481
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,360
affects you

482
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,639
because you never smoke it in that

483
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,519
culture yeah so americans were the first

484
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,039
people taking all these hash plants and

485
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,160
and afghans

486
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,678
and actually wanting to smoke them yeah

487
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,519
it hadn't happened before because none

488
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,759
of those people back back home where

489
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,720
they were from gave a [ __ ]

490
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,519
yes

491
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,798
and you can kind of draw a line from

492
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,519
morocco

493
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,599
on the the western part of africa all

494
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,879
throughout north africa all the way up

495
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,198
through

496
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,959
lebanon and israel

497
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
all the way over iran and into

498
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,160
afghanistan and that's all hash

499
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,359
yeah

500
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,919
right

501
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,759
but then once you get to like cambodia

502
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,679
thailand

503
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,879
that all kind of got lost

504
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,679
yeah and it flipped into weed smoking

505
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,440
and exporting actual wheat

506
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,720
you know my heart huh i wonder why

507
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
i don't know why that one became so

508
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,120
separate

509
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,319
you know i don't know

510
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,959
you know

511
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,798
um you know and you know it's like i i

512
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,038
prefer flower too to be honest and i

513
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,960
don't think that we need to like base

514
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,200
what what what we think of on what

515
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,038
afghans think um

516
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,360
but uh you know

517
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,480
definitely they um you know they just

518
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,240
thought that because that was the

519
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,360
culture that they were raised men smoke

520
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,319
ash

521
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,879
yeah

522
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,759
you know and women smoke flower and

523
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,200
slaves i like that they weren't

524
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,200
good enough

525
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,480
women were puffing tough on the flower

526
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
over there

527
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,279
and you know and so there's this thing

528
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,960
where when i first went over to

529
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,038
amsterdam i met this guy he's still over

530
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,720
there steve the nose or whatever and i

531
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,919
got introduced to some of this hashish

532
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,079
culture

533
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,160
and they would show me the best moroccan

534
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,038
the best lebanese these are amazing

535
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,000
temple balls this is from afghanistan

536
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,919
this is from the pakistani highlands

537
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
and you smoke all this stuff and it's

538
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,640
unbelievable

539
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,319
yeah like he had the best hash

540
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,600
collection i've ever seen in my life and

541
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,279
these guys

542
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,038
they didn't even really smoke weed very

543
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,798
much they had it

544
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,919
you know but they mostly cared about

545
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,759
hashish

546
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,440
that's so funny you know and they

547
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,440
thought they didn't care what method you

548
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,120
used they didn't care what extraction

549
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,600
technique you had

550
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,038
uh didn't all all those cuts that you

551
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,399
could make hash off of they were

552
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,000
inferior

553
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,960
yeah

554
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,720
they were it was inferior hashish

555
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,160
interesting you know

556
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,679
yeah and you know and so we we

557
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,400
huh

558
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,640
when we knew you there i'm here

559
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
so you know they um

560
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,360
so

561
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,000
it's really a big it's really

562
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,439
interesting because americans like until

563
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,960
things open up

564
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,919
um i would say that 99 of americans have

565
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,720
probably never smoked the top import

566
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,480
grade of hash that you can get yeah

567
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,480
they just haven't seen it yeah it

568
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
doesn't it doesn't show up it gets it

569
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,798
barely gets to europe

570
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,960
yeah before it gets absorbed i see a lot

571
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,240
of people asking about the the opium

572
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,679
thing

573
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,038
and i can comment on that real quick

574
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,160
what they're referring to is an old

575
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,879
story

576
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,320
and it wasn't hash it wasn't a weed

577
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,080
thing it was necessarily it wasn't

578
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,000
necessarily a weird thing the story was

579
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,480
that tie sticks were dipped in something

580
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,279
called passa water which was uh the

581
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,079
water used when you produce heroin so

582
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,519
when you're when you're doing the

583
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,439
conversion from opium to heroin the

584
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,440
leftover water is called passive water

585
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,120
so there was theories and or people

586
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,480
would spread stories that you know all

587
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,479
thai sticks were dipped in past the

588
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,319
water and that's why they were so strong

589
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,720
when in reality it probably wasn't the

590
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,879
case that's not really how how the the

591
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,640
water works drying on the

592
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
to weed you know

593
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,400
but it that that is stuck forever so

594
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,120
that a lot of people think that thai

595
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,679
sticks have heroin in them and that's

596
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,558
yeah that's where that came from

597
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,159
and you know they don't mostly because

598
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,558
yeah i think if it happened it would

599
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,760
have been very rare i mean the re the

600
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,798
reason why is because cartels like that

601
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,960
um

602
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,519
they don't put more expensive drugs on

603
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,600
cheaper ones yeah for free that's not

604
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,918
how that's not how they operate you know

605
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,599
yeah i mean uh you know now with like

606
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,200
the whole fentanyl thing and all that

607
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,519
their people are cutting all kinds of

608
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,600
stuff with highly dangerous substances

609
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,119
yeah uh back in the day if anything got

610
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,639
cut with anything it was by something

611
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,279
cheaper and weaker

612
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,880
yeah i still am very skeptical on on

613
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,639
street fentanyl being cut into normal

614
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,159
things because it's still more expensive

615
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
i would imagine then

616
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,520
most of the drugs are saying that it's

617
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
cut with it doesn't really make sense

618
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,558
unless people are trying to buy fentanyl

619
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,720
and they're cutting it with [ __ ] but

620
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,240
cheaper i'm gonna i'm gonna reiterate it

621
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
one more time just because i think it's

622
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,880
really important which is that almost

623
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,760
all traditional hash regardless of grade

624
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,320
or quality is made out of thousands and

625
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,839
thousands and thousands of sister plants

626
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,879
grown from seed

627
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,399
and so you get a very wide range of that

628
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
that strains

629
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,000
profile thc

630
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,159
cbd cbn terpenes all that kind of stuff

631
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,119
it all gets blended together

632
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,720
right yeah and so it's

633
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,839
vastly different

634
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,240
than

635
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:59,038
growing a room or growing a greenhouse

636
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,200
of gmo or skittles yeah or something

637
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,319
along those lines and taking the exact

638
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,240
same genetic cut

639
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:10,158
right yep and

640
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,440
that exact same genetic cut and uh

641
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,159
and and extracting that

642
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,759
right

643
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,919
it's just very different and the way

644
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,839
they process it is different and how

645
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,840
long that it takes them before they

646
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,279
think it's cured into something that

647
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,240
they want to smoke

648
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:29,038
is also different so american hash

649
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,599
culture is very new

650
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,679
and it goes against the grain as far as

651
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,678
like any other kinds of

652
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,759
uh hashish culture that you would that

653
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,038
you would you would see now it is true

654
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:43,119
of course that with with demand

655
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,279
right they're going to mix all kind

656
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,678
brokers and and and people looking for

657
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,720
profit are going to mix all kinds of of

658
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,280
cut into hash yeah i'm talking about the

659
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,759
nicest stuff i'm talking about the pure

660
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,918
grade yeah right and hash in these

661
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,839
regions was a lot better

662
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,440
before all these white people showed up

663
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,359
demanding tons

664
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,200
oh i'm sure

665
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,319
and then once all these europeans and

666
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,080
all these english and all these

667
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,798
americans started showing up on the

668
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,439
hippie hashish trail in the 70s and they

669
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,599
wanted just enormous amounts of it they

670
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,038
blew through all the best

671
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,240
and then of course just like any other

672
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,038
humans you're going to get a bunch of

673
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,759
people that are trying to meet demand

674
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,519
yeah so the quality on average is going

675
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,798
to go way down

676
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,918
and you're going to get a bunch of b and

677
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,519
c grade

678
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,919
and then you're going to get

679
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,000
you know and then you're going to get um

680
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,440
you know the the top end is going to be

681
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
a lot more rare

682
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
yeah

683
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,519
you know

684
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,359
um and you know

685
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,400
the like i said all those old-timers

686
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,798
that smokehash they all swear

687
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,000
that the best traditional hash is still

688
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,599
the best

689
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
yeah now whether that's because of the

690
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,240
strains they use whether that's because

691
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,280
they dry farm it you know i mean i'm

692
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
sure there's a bunch of different

693
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,759
reasons

694
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,960
but the process itself is very different

695
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,119
yeah

696
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,558
and the effect is very different and

697
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,319
they they all they all swear by it and

698
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,359
that's what they take the best of what

699
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,599
they grow

700
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,759
um you know and that and people say that

701
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,278
too people say i see that all the time i

702
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,720
have a buddy of mine that was like oh

703
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,240
yeah yeah yeah they know what they're

704
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,839
[ __ ] talking about they [ __ ] make

705
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
hash with the same hat the hand they

706
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,240
[ __ ] wipe their [ __ ] on

707
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,400
yeah right and it's basically like

708
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,558
these people these humans that have

709
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,038
spent thousands of years refining their

710
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,639
hash culture don't know [ __ ]

711
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:33,679
yeah from what we've learned since oh

712
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,240
wait on

713
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,919
yeah right

714
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,679
right and different cultures

715
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,159
we've gone we've gone through everybody

716
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,440
dabs with a [ __ ] thousand degree

717
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,720
glowing cherry red hot nail or banger

718
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,480
yeah unpurged bho

719
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,880
every two or three years we're like

720
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,720
improving our technique and you only

721
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,559
have to go back five or six or seven

722
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,839
years to techniques and [ __ ] that people

723
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,319
wouldn't do again

724
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,158
yeah yeah already get out of style that

725
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,359
we learned that a bunch of these

726
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,120
terpenes are like carcinogenic

727
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,038
yeah at the heat that most of these

728
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,839
people were dabbing them

729
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,839
yeah

730
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,678
with right and then the other thing too

731
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,399
is when you watch you know you can get

732
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,080
on ig right and you can watch some of

733
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,720
these hash cultures work and how they

734
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,158
heat the hash and how they work the hash

735
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,079
you know and how they get the hash

736
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,640
malleable and how they get

737
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,599
the resin to be warm before they use it

738
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,278
you know

739
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,439
all that different types of stuff and

740
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,960
like and so there's a lot to learn from

741
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,400
those people

742
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,880
you know because they've been smoking

743
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,120
hash for a long time

744
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,919
yeah you know and like we you know we

745
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,158
stumble upon all this stuff and we think

746
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,600
we're doing amazing because you can see

747
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,278
through you know we want to put it on a

748
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,079
piece of parchment paper and be able to

749
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,519
see through it yeah we want to make it a

750
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,599
fresh frozen

751
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,759
harvested fresh frozen put into this

752
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,839
thing put through a freezer dryer all

753
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,000
this different stuff and

754
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,359
you know um you know frenchie people

755
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
talking about frenchie and stuff like

756
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,158
that and he did bring a little bit of

757
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,360
the

758
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,679
of of of of that different culture into

759
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,558
all this you know but there's an aspect

760
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,440
of

761
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,158
um you know the the old-timers will tell

762
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,720
you

763
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,720
that you would store the hash in like in

764
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,319
loose bags right

765
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,159
in a cold spot

766
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,558
and they said if you wanted to ruin your

767
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,520
hash you put it in the fridge

768
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,678
yeah

769
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,440
and and the fridge and the humidity and

770
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,360
the [ __ ] would ruin your [ __ ]

771
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,919
hash they were like if you wanted to

772
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,918
ruin it just just do that to it but if

773
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,799
you put it into a cold dry cellar and

774
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,400
you let it age for a while

775
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,759
boom

776
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
it would get better

777
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,919
yeah you know and

778
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
you know and so and they also grow with

779
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,880
a bunch of different cultivars that

780
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,440
we're not used to

781
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,799
yeah that's very true too

782
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,120
you know um and you know and they you

783
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:00,240
know they grow from seed every year

784
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,918
yeah right and we don't we grow from

785
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,038
clones

786
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,200
you know yeah um and so we've gotten

787
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,640
really especially on the west coast you

788
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,038
know um

789
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,440
we've gotten really egotistical

790
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,879
about our hash making yes and about our

791
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,798
extracts and we are you know we are

792
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,039
doing better i'm not i'm not saying that

793
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,319
like what we do isn't viable

794
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,000
i'm just saying that like from the

795
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,839
people in amsterdam that have vast

796
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,880
experience with both

797
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,399
yeah

798
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,080
they all prefer

799
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,559
the traditional [ __ ] if they can get the

800
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,918
grade they want oh i'm sure so that

801
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,200
should say something

802
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,679
okay people are asking the title of the

803
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,159
book and and someone did point out that

804
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,720
cherniat maybe isn't so well liked but

805
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,520
um this is with uh lawrence cherniak and

806
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,278
alan drunker's it's called

807
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,119
uh how she used the joy of making and

808
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,640
curing it's i was just putting up some

809
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,399
pictures to illustrate as we were

810
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,799
talking about how she used the different

811
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,320
styles looks

812
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,319
techniques in here

813
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,519
but yeah people used to sit there and i

814
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,319
don't know if you can see my hand or

815
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:03,200
whatever um but like you can they would

816
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,359
sit there and rub and rub and work and

817
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,600
work and work and really get the hash

818
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,278
warm and malleable sometimes people

819
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,359
would put it into a plastic bag and they

820
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,679
would put it in the heel of their shoe

821
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,599
yeah and they would walk on it to like

822
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,759
work and work and work and they wouldn't

823
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,678
just sit there and you'll see videos on

824
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,599
ig now because there's people that are

825
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,159
going around afghanistan and pakistan

826
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,079
and some of these hash cultures

827
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,278
of how before they use it they heat it

828
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,439
up

829
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,960
they work it they get it to be they get

830
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,038
it to be a certain way so there's a lot

831
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,640
of there's a lot of uh

832
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,558
there's a lot of old techniques that i

833
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,880
think are kind of being ignored

834
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,158
yeah that um

835
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,720
you know it's almost like this [ __ ]

836
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,200
where like in california in the 70s

837
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,240
people knew about red and white wine

838
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,240
yeah

839
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
you know that was that was the level of

840
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,919
knowledge that like red went with

841
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,919
with prime rib and meat you know and

842
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,840
white was for their wife

843
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,559
and went with fish or chicken or

844
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,639
something and that's about all they knew

845
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,119
yeah and now you fast forward 30 years

846
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,799
or 40 years or whatever and now it's

847
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,278
like they're like oh merlot and this

848
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:12,960
appalachian and the pinot gris that's

849
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,960
that um you know that uh

850
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,840
that's that's all going on

851
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,079
and and whatnot and you know i think the

852
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,398
same thing is gonna happen with hash

853
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,439
yeah we're a baby hash culture in

854
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,439
america

855
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,360
and we don't know [ __ ] and we're

856
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,038
learning stuff and every few years you

857
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,359
can see hash culture and you can see

858
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,798
people's techniques improve

859
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,439
yeah right

860
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,720
um but we could learn a lot from

861
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,798
you know and maybe they'll get to a

862
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,600
point like with the legality of things

863
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,440
or whatnot where you could grow a field

864
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,879
yeah like it would be cool for seed

865
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,320
makers right where you could grow a

866
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,200
field

867
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,200
of uh of seeds

868
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,480
yeah and then harvest the whole thing

869
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,080
for hatch

870
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,558
yeah that would be awesome and then you

871
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,879
get the full range of whatever you know

872
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:01,839
matt's bubble berry or or yeah you know

873
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,760
a skittles hybrid or a gmo hybrid or

874
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,079
whatever the case may be you'd get the

875
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,079
full range in the hash

876
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,000
instead of just like this one cut i'm

877
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,879
going to concentrate what's in this one

878
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,319
cut

879
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
yeah because that's never been done

880
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,038
before right

881
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,558
yeah that's not exactly how it's done

882
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,879
over there it's not typically how it's

883
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,319
done over there and so we have we have

884
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,760
our own thing and it's not bad or

885
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,558
anything like that i'm not saying that

886
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,720
but

887
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,519
it it's very different

888
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,360
yeah

889
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,000
it's very different now

890
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,359
we could expand it out a little bit

891
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,798
and talk about

892
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,719
um when

893
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,319
when they first started bringing afghans

894
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,640
you know we all started growing sativa

895
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,759
in america right yeah

896
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,679
because

897
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,640
sativa seeds came free with the [ __ ]

898
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,360
wheat

899
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,200
yeah you get kilos of you know head

900
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,959
stash brought in and everyone's selling

901
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,360
it your weed came with

902
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,798
free seeds yeah we used to sit there in

903
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,038
high school leaning back against the

904
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,119
chair and we'd have a we'd have a tray

905
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,038
and you'd break up the weed up here and

906
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,839
you let all the seeds and stems roll

907
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,759
down

908
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,519
and yep keep and you keep your weed up

909
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,359
there right but

910
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,038
hash didn't come with free seats

911
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,119
yeah yeah

912
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,679
so i'm just watching someone tell a joke

913
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,599
about bubble man

914
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,519
we uh so we don't have we don't we don't

915
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,879
we didn't get very many seeds so

916
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,879
you know

917
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,320
sativas were all everywhere everywhere

918
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,559
in the 70s and 80s and that was

919
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,240
primarily what it all was how do you

920
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,960
think puck washes

921
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,960
how do i think like man you know

922
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,558
if you want to if you want if there's

923
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,079
people out there that don't like me and

924
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,720
you want to think of me as a shitty

925
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,519
grower i should show you some pictures

926
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,759
of

927
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,759
my puck grows

928
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,839
because i did some i did some depths and

929
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,200
i did some greenhouse outdoors with it

930
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,000
and uh

931
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,519
boy was it not impressive no i wouldn't

932
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,359
wash it because there would be no reason

933
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,200
to wash off of it i got it was it was a

934
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,959
really ugly i mean i can't say what it

935
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,558
looked like in the 80s or in the 90s

936
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
when it was a little younger

937
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,398
um but you know when i got it it hated

938
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,679
sunlight and food

939
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,359
yeah

940
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,960
and you know strangely enough those were

941
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,798
two things that i like to give my plants

942
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,679
sunlight and food at the time so yeah

943
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,639
yeah it was uh it was really unusual

944
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,960
um

945
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,480
you know and uh

946
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,240
you know they uh

947
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,919
so there's you know bubble hash and

948
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,278
there's another aspect of it too where

949
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,320
it's like maybe we should we could talk

950
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,759
about this for a second is that

951
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,918
most people

952
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,679
most most americans i was gonna say

953
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,240
white people but most americans will say

954
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,278
it that way right yeah like we don't

955
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,278
like our time is our time is money

956
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,919
you know so you look at the way

957
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,440
traditional people sift sifting is an

958
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,919
amazing product

959
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,080
but it's the most time consuming yeah

960
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,880
and it gets the least yield

961
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,639
so

962
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,880
it's the rarest

963
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,559
so americans are constantly looking for

964
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,840
can i wash this

965
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:56,480
can i bho it can i see what what way can

966
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,558
i do it that's efficient and i can get

967
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,159
an extraction that yields

968
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,000
how can i get yield

969
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,840
right well most of the time you have to

970
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,880
put that through a solvent

971
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:09,439
it's not just knocking the flowers

972
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,278
yeah over a screen and getting and

973
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,440
getting dry sift and then putting that

974
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,480
dry sip through a series of screens and

975
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,720
cleaning it up like bubble man as shown

976
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,798
right even water is the salt water is

977
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,159
the original solvent

978
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,398
that's why it's so funny that people

979
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,960
call water solventless

980
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,038
water hash is solventless like look

981
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,480
put in is water a solvent into google

982
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,599
and see what comes up

983
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,640
yeah

984
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,398
it's a solvent yeah sure is the original

985
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,200
and what's crazy about that is if you

986
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,439
read now granted there's a lot of

987
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,200
there's a there's some thc and terpenes

988
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,480
and stuff like that aren't soluble in

989
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,440
water

990
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,000
yeah

991
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,278
but there is if you read like rob

992
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,679
clark's book hashish about 25 of

993
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,640
terpenes are water soluble

994
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,278
yeah

995
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,000
so you can so there's times when we did

996
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,440
stuff with water hash right where

997
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,880
you run something like some kind of

998
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,759
tangy cross

999
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,159
yeah

1000
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,559
and that and that citrus that citrus

1001
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,480
comes through super strong

1002
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,279
right yeah but then you run something

1003
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,519
like the 56 day headband and it comes

1004
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,839
out smelling like axle grease

1005
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,559
yeah it's super potent

1006
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,719
but it's like chemical process didn't

1007
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,199
like it's if the chain that makes up the

1008
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,799
the the aroma and the taste

1009
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,398
didn't make it through the hash making

1010
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,200
process

1011
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:30,078
right

1012
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,759
so

1013
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,639
most of the stuff we do today whether

1014
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,960
it's bho or whether it's water hash and

1015
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,878
then frozen or this or that a lot of

1016
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,440
these things affect the flavor

1017
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,759
and a lot of what becomes popular

1018
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,918
is what keeps its flavor

1019
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,720
with the time saving techniques that we

1020
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,759
use to make hash extraction easier

1021
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,918
yeah

1022
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,919
you know i mean you watch you watch

1023
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,519
these guys like on ig or whatever then

1024
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,598
you see them do their traditional hash

1025
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,519
thing no american wants to be sitting

1026
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,119
there with a face mask on for eight

1027
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:05,759
hours a day over a thing shaking

1028
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,960
flour and knocking off the crystals and

1029
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,480
then carefully you know like refining it

1030
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,599
it doesn't get you enough weight for

1031
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,719
your time

1032
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,440
yeah

1033
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,519
people we want to use machines

1034
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,480
well that changes it too

1035
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,759
yeah

1036
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,000
right

1037
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,839
it has to do and part of the reason why

1038
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,440
i think like the tangi and the whole to

1039
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,440
mention that again the tangent the whole

1040
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,440
citrus craze happened

1041
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,679
is because when

1042
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,760
like you know in the mid 2000s you

1043
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,838
couldn't give away calio

1044
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,920
no no people would not

1045
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,440
if you had citrus weed that was a great

1046
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,800
way for your broker to look at you and

1047
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,400
say no dog

1048
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,519
yeah not a dog i don't need that

1049
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,838
headache

1050
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,159
i'm not taking your weed you know but

1051
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,559
then and it was also citrus weed tends

1052
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,399
to not be that potent yeah

1053
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,679
so it's it's you know you could call it

1054
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,800
i don't want to say minzy but you could

1055
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,799
say moderately potent at best yeah where

1056
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,760
the flavor people did blank

1057
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,599
lacking recreational potency yeah but

1058
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,320
then

1059
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,400
you start extracting it with bho or this

1060
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,720
or that or whatever and all of a sudden

1061
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,039
that that citrus terpene came through

1062
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,559
super solid and now the shit's 70

1063
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,880
percent thc

1064
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,838
yeah and it actually gets you high

1065
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,240
yeah and so a lot of the popular strains

1066
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,519
in america that got made into hash

1067
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,439
um

1068
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,358
got made into hash because after you put

1069
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,200
them through the the processes that we

1070
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:33,279
do to make life easy

1071
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,279
yeah still tasted and worked good

1072
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,400
you know but the but the old like the

1073
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,320
old static tech and the old like and the

1074
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,800
old sifting tech that was like used

1075
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,320
forever that wasn't abandoned because it

1076
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,720
sucked it was abandoned because it was

1077
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,320
lower yield and took a lot more time

1078
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,399
yeah

1079
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,400
and amer and you know most hash guys

1080
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,358
like to make their money quick right

1081
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,119
yeah turn it over i want to turn it over

1082
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:58,639
you know and so

1083
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,280
you get like what you think is the

1084
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,039
world's most amazing hash

1085
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,400
the hash collectors in europe don't

1086
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,800
think you're smoking the world's most

1087
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,639
amazing hash yeah that's not that it's

1088
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,560
not good

1089
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,400
and everybody can have their opinion you

1090
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:16,239
know yeah they just have a different

1091
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,000
perspective on it and uh more

1092
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,439
man it's hard to say a bit more cultured

1093
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,199
at some points when it comes to hash

1094
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,880
specifically

1095
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,559
i mean it's one of those things like

1096
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,760
like that's why you can compare it to

1097
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,759
wine

1098
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,079
yeah you know it's like

1099
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,320
now in california you can have all these

1100
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,160
wine nerds that are extremely

1101
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,440
intelligent about the different grapes

1102
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,920
and the different grades and the

1103
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,000
different appellations and where certain

1104
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,760
varieties do better than others because

1105
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,880
of climate

1106
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,480
yeah in the 70s it was red and white

1107
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,160
and that's kind of where we are hashish

1108
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,480
wise right now we're just learning and

1109
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,159
like anybody who's listening right now

1110
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,559
like you know who's made hash for the

1111
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,838
last 10 or 15 years think about how much

1112
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,519
your techniques and what you've been

1113
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:00,320
doing has been changing

1114
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,440
every year or two this whole time

1115
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,039
it's not like you've reached the

1116
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,559
mountaintop

1117
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,559
you know it's like people figure out a

1118
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,639
way to do it better and then people are

1119
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,400
like oh [ __ ] i'm going to do it that way

1120
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,239
yeah and a lot of the traditional ash

1121
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,639
people tell me that most of the modern

1122
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:17,279
cultivars that we grow with suck as far

1123
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,118
as hash extraction

1124
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,480
where you get some yeah where you get

1125
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,480
some lebanese [ __ ] or you get some

1126
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,800
nepalese stuff that for generations has

1127
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,400
been grown just for that

1128
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,920
and that [ __ ] dumps

1129
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,119
yeah

1130
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,200
you know because that's what they

1131
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,680
designed it to do

1132
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,239
and when when the hash revolution hit 10

1133
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,919
12 years ago you know um

1134
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,759
people started looking around for all

1135
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,400
the elites that had been kept around and

1136
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,440
do any of these also dump hash

1137
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,599
yeah

1138
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,519
they weren't bred for that

1139
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,079
no one ever thought of it

1140
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,440
hash was like a you know hash was like a

1141
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,280
personal product

1142
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,800
yeah maybe you could get some key for

1143
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,079
the club maybe you should get some water

1144
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,359
hash at a club

1145
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,359
you know

1146
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,039
people would get scissor hash

1147
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:02,639
you know if you were working or people

1148
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,559
would get finger hash when they were

1149
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,639
bucking down stuff and all that but it

1150
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,759
wasn't like commoditized

1151
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,400
right

1152
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,160
did you ever use an iso 2

1153
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,400
oh god yeah

1154
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,759
i want i want one of those to try out if

1155
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
any of you guys out there have an iso

1156
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,000
too i will trade you some seeds for one

1157
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,440
uh i used to use my dad's as like a

1158
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,679
he-man castle along with my group uh

1159
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,000
castle grayskull and [ __ ] but i'd really

1160
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,000
like to see how it works today you know

1161
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,880
we could probably do a we could probably

1162
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,039
do a whole show one time on just the

1163
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,838
different eras of like oh that sounds

1164
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,920
cool

1165
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,599
yeah oh i'm gonna go on an octagon oh

1166
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,838
i'm gonna grow areaponics oh i'm gonna

1167
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,800
grow nft oh i'm going to grow this way

1168
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:47,599
oh i'm going to extract that way oh yeah

1169
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,119
you know coliseums yeah colosseums i

1170
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,200
mean dude i had to call it i had two

1171
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,640
coliseum i mean we could go through all

1172
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,719
that of just all like whatever is the

1173
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,598
most cutting-edge [ __ ] imaginable you

1174
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:59,679
know do you remember the v tables the

1175
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,280
they were like that yeah yeah i remember

1176
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,279
when those popped up there's a pencil

1177
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,800
and so it's funny right because a lot of

1178
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,800
my friends are egotistical or whatever

1179
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,200
you know but it's like the the main you

1180
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,400
talk to hash people in california and

1181
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,679
the west coast now and they think

1182
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,440
they're the best hash people that have

1183
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,118
ever lived sure

1184
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,880
that they dominate

1185
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,480
you know and i'm not dissing them

1186
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,559
because they are figuring stuff out and

1187
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,240
they are making nice hash

1188
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,480
yeah right most of them are failed

1189
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:27,039
growers [ __ ] them they're also turning

1190
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,119
their back on thousands of years of

1191
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,320
humans learning [ __ ]

1192
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,559
yeah

1193
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,160
you know and and it's it's like it's

1194
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,320
like when you're shocked when old people

1195
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:39,920
have something to teach you

1196
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,599
yeah you know yeah uh you know there's

1197
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,720
there's there's techniques and there's

1198
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,720
things and there's aspects um you know

1199
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:50,239
that uh you know i mean think about all

1200
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,239
those classes that frenchie did

1201
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,760
who the [ __ ] are you yeah to be

1202
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,679
you know and he was and he all he was

1203
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,440
doing was just

1204
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:00,719
teaching some people

1205
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,559
how

1206
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,959
different cultures over there made some

1207
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:08,239
hatch yeah

1208
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,440
you know and people ate it up

1209
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,719
yeah they did

1210
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,960
you know and there's different flavor

1211
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,959
profiles and there might be a way where

1212
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,639
you take a cultivar and you extract it

1213
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,599
one way and it fights potent but it

1214
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,639
sucks

1215
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,920
and then you do it another way and it's

1216
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,679
amazing

1217
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,960
so it's not like all strains react the

1218
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,919
same like something like i said some

1219
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,559
things go through water like a champ

1220
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,400
right i even did [ __ ] where i would have

1221
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,400
like a a greenhouse

1222
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,000
full of the same strains and then i

1223
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,680
would have outdoor

1224
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,599
yeah and like sometimes like the sour

1225
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,879
diesels and certain things like that if

1226
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,960
they got rained on a bunch in october

1227
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,680
their terpene profile wouldn't be

1228
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,679
exactly what i was after yeah but the

1229
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,519
sour diesel grown 30 feet away in a

1230
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,358
greenhouse that never got rained on once

1231
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,480
it was fed with the same food and the

1232
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:58,318
same everything would be bomb

1233
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,760
you know but like the super silver haze

1234
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,599
or certain citrus stuff it wasn't

1235
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,920
affected by the rain at all

1236
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,240
yeah it just kept its profile but

1237
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,480
sometimes the rain enough rain would

1238
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,519
[ __ ] up the flavor on my weed

1239
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,719
yeah

1240
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,519
you know

1241
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:15,118
um and uh well you know someone just

1242
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,920
said it's potent but it sucks that's the

1243
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,240
biggest oxymoron ever not really it

1244
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,720
depends because it depends on how it

1245
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,399
depends on how you

1246
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,318
what the high is like

1247
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,960
yeah right i mean you can quality of

1248
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:31,838
high you can read old high times right

1249
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,760
and not to bring up high times but

1250
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,519
a lot of people's opinion of the old

1251
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,359
afghani one

1252
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,920
was that it was a uncomfortable

1253
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,318
anxiety-inducing body high that gave you

1254
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,119
heart palpitations and it was one of the

1255
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,519
least enjoyable smokes out there yeah

1256
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,559
and they way preferred sativas or normal

1257
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,759
or nl's or there was lots of other highs

1258
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,159
that they liked

1259
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,760
yeah they thought it was potent

1260
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,920
but they didn't like it

1261
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,040
yeah you know some people like some some

1262
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,318
people the

1263
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,400
that sativa buzz that nl5 haze buzz or

1264
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,759
that neville's haze buzz it's super

1265
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,440
potent and it makes them want to crawl

1266
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,960
out of their skin and jump off a bridge

1267
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,039
and die and they'd never smoke it again

1268
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,800
if you know they hate it yeah that's

1269
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,960
like me with skunk one types they

1270
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,880
[ __ ] hate it it's super potent it's

1271
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,838
amazing it's the nicest sativa i've ever

1272
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,280
smoked

1273
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,480
but there's people that are smoking a

1274
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,160
couple of times and they'll be like i no

1275
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,960
that's a bad time for me

1276
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,039
so

1277
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,800
you know potency is just one aspect it

1278
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,079
just means it's strong it doesn't mean

1279
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,519
that it's going to affect you in a

1280
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,318
pleasant way

1281
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,838
yeah you know i personally i don't like

1282
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,838
edibles

1283
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,400
yeah oh no you can't control the high

1284
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:41,920
you can't you're just strapped in

1285
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,920
because and the reason why i don't like

1286
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,480
edibles and i'll be perfectly honest is

1287
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,240
that they [ __ ] with my equilibrium

1288
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,440
oh really they give me this like you

1289
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,279
know when you're drunk and you're like

1290
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,760
if i put a foot on the ground i'll stop

1291
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,079
the spins yeah yeah they can give me the

1292
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,000
spins ooh that's not and i don't like

1293
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,359
that feeling yeah and i'll have friends

1294
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,039
that'll be like oh you just gotta eat

1295
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,119
enough and blow past it

1296
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,119
yeah and for me i'm like well how how

1297
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,079
many hours of uncomfortable do i have to

1298
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,200
feel before i start feeling good yeah

1299
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,480
because

1300
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,000
i don't feel good

1301
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,079
yeah you know i like weed a whole bunch

1302
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,838
and i don't feel good at all

1303
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,599
you know so how many hours of my life do

1304
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,480
i want to not feel good

1305
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,559
yeah

1306
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,199
you know that happens to me enough you

1307
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,440
know so i don't do edibles because

1308
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,799
like i got kids and [ __ ] you know so

1309
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,440
you know one of my kids could break

1310
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,480
their toe or whatever and yeah

1311
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,920
it doesn't matter how much weed i've

1312
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,119
smoked i can hop in the car i can take

1313
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,440
them to the hospital i can do whatever i

1314
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,400
need to do yeah but if i just ate a

1315
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,960
couple hundred

1316
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,800
milligrams of edibles

1317
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,720
i might need to like call a lifeline you

1318
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,440
know or yeah for sure

1319
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,959
i'm not you know

1320
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,240
and then yeah i have all kinds of people

1321
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,679
are gonna start commenting oh you just

1322
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,679
need to take these you just need to ate

1323
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,519
these i'm just saying that for me

1324
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,598
the way my body works

1325
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,000
sometimes it gives me the spins

1326
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,359
yeah and i don't like the spins i think

1327
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,760
a lot of people don't understand that

1328
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,519
though how how variable the everybody's

1329
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,560
brain chemistry is and how each

1330

cannabinoid or what have you interacts

1332
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,279
differently with everyone not everybody

1333
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,639
gets the same effect from the same clone

1334
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,319
though though you know i mean

1335

00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,159
for people that have a hard time and a

1370
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,959
bunch of nausea

1371

you know um i'm not trying to make foot

1372

fun off it or whatever that might be the

1373
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,160
best way for them to absorb

1374
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,318
yeah

1375
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,920
i got a pretty funny pretty funny story

1376
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,519
about boofing stuff

1377
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,920
so i had a friend named brian he's dead

1378
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,920
now but he had heard that if you boof

1379
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,240
oxycontin and granted that we were like

1380
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,159
17 18. you heard that if you boof

1381
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,239
oxycontin you get really [ __ ] up and

1382
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,960
this is the early days of oxycontin

1383
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,598
so he stuck the oxycontin up his ass and

1384
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,679
waited and waited and then he realized

1385
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,519
that there's a coating on the outside

1386
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,960
that it really won't penetrate through

1387
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:01,199
your [ __ ]

1388
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,358
so he had to crush it up and re-insert

1389
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,679
it and do his ass

1390
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:07,119
that's my boofing story you're welcome

1391
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,199
everyone

1392
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,039
i i do joke with

1393
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:11,759
my friends that are younger than me you

1394
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,000
know

1395
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,200
that their contribution to drug culture

1396
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,199
is boofing

1397
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,239
yeah really that is that really that's

1398
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,679
what they that's what they're going to

1399
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,199
be remembered for that's their

1400
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,480
innovation

1401
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,679
yeah you know

1402
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,159
all that different types of stuff and

1403
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:27,679
you know whatever it it uh

1404
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:28,799
like i have seen

1405
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,879
people

1406
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,599
making suppositories for very sick

1407
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,358
cancer patients and aids patients and

1408
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,039
other various aspects

1409
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,598
and i'm sure

1410
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,159
that uh they do a great job

1411
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,800
um but what people also should know too

1412
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:47,039
is that when you eat when you eat weed

1413
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,039
or you take it you know a suppository

1414
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:53,679
style it turns into thc 11.

1415
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,440
okay did you know that no i didn't it

1416
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,480
converts into something when you smoke

1417
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,679
it it's it's delta 11 thc delta 11.

1418
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,960
that's right

1419
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:05,199
and uh it's much longer lasting

1420
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,960
you know um and so that's kind of why

1421
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,358
you get [ __ ] like in the sense of like

1422
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,800
if if it hits you the wrong way

1423
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:12,318
yeah you're sort of stuck with that

1424
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,480
feeling for a while

1425
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:15,838
yeah and so me and delta nine are real

1426
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,400
good friends

1427
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,480
yeah delta nine and me we get along we

1428
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,480
we see eye to eye on things

1429
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,159
i can smoke whatever format even you

1430
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,079
know i don't i'm more of a flower person

1431
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,679
than hash but i can smoke a bunch of

1432
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,960
hash and i can still accomplish whatever

1433
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:33,598
i need to do yeah 11 hydroxy not delta

1434
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,800
that makes sense okay yeah 11 maybe i

1435
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,800
misspoke but um but yeah it it converts

1436
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,800
in your gut into something different

1437
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,839
okay and it's longer lasting and it has

1438
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,280
a

1439
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,279
some different effects

1440
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,680
well yeah doesn't it um bind with your

1441
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,160
fat cells too which makes it more potent

1442
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:52,399
in your stomach now we're getting into

1443
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,920
into areas i'm not familiar with

1444
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,440
yeah you know it's one of those things

1445
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,039
where i don't care about edibles that

1446
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,760
much because i don't

1447
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:02,079
um i don't uh i don't use them they're

1448
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,599
not that important to me you know i i do

1449
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,119
think that they're a great way for some

1450
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,760
people to get medicine

1451
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:11,280
yeah you know but i i got [ __ ] to do and

1452
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,880
i got kids and i can't take myself out

1453
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,040
yeah yeah it's a good way to take

1454
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,880
yourself out and you know to be honest

1455
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:18,558
like in the 90s and stuff like that you

1456
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,240
know uh

1457
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,519
now you can go to the you can go to the

1458
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,838
store and you can be like oh i'm going

1459
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,800
to get a 5 milligram or a 10 milligram

1460
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,960
or a 50 or 100 milligram you know yeah

1461
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,880
um and back in the day

1462
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,280
you know and you know when i was doing

1463
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,440
edibles more it was like is this ganja

1464
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,400
goo ball am i gonna feel anything

1465
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,480
yeah

1466
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,760
all the way up to i'm in my tent and i

1467
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,679
can't move

1468
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,720
yeah and i'm missing the festival

1469
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:47,039
because i'm horizontal

1470
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,799
you know yeah okay

1471
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,318
just primary just answered he said no it

1472
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,318
crosses the blood brain barrier more

1473
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,079
easily makes sense it converts in the

1474
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:56,000
liver not the gut which totally makes

1475
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,599
sense yeah yeah i knew i was gonna i

1476
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,800
knew i was gonna misspeak i knew that it

1477
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,039
affected you differently and it

1478
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,720
converted differently yeah um i was

1479
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,719
nervous to talk about the various

1480
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,078
science of it because i i wasn't i

1481
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,558
probably wasn't going to get there yeah

1482
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,839
see i'm i'm very um adventuresome and

1483
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,839
i'll talk about the science of it you

1484
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,679
know exactly nothing what i'm talking

1485
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,920
about so i'm good at that part i just

1486
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:19,039
knew that it converted differently

1487
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,680
and it and it it lasted longer and it

1488
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,880
has a different series of effects

1489
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,879
uh than inhale and then smoking

1490
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,800
yeah i know someone said that um people

1491
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,519
with diabetes can't feel edibles and i

1492
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,599
can

1493
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:33,440
absolutely disprove that

1494
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,318
because i'm diabetic and i can feel

1495
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,920
animals

1496
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,679
yeah i mean i i've been on you know i've

1497
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,960
eaten some ganja goo balls at times and

1498
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,558
stuff and i

1499
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,000
definitely i'm not i'm speaking from

1500
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,680
experience when

1501
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,760
i was like i'm in the tent and i can't

1502
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,759
move i can't stand up i need to pee am i

1503
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,040
going to pee myself

1504
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,200
can i move

1505
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,960
yeah you know that's the good [ __ ] yeah

1506
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:54,399
because you know it's just like it's

1507
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,240
just bad dosing

1508
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,680
yeah these six kinds of goo balls are

1509
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,239
almost worthless and you wasted your

1510
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,318
money and this one is like catatonic

1511
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,719
yeah you know do you really want to be

1512
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,639
catatonic at a festival you know yeah i

1513
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,639
know that's how you get raped happens

1514
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,480
well no

1515
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,239
but it's just yeah you paid money to be

1516
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,519
there and now you're laying on rocks on

1517
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,719
in the tent

1518
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:16,000
spinning

1519
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:16,959
you know

1520
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,880
um

1521
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,240
but it's just one of those things where

1522
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,838
it's like uh

1523
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,919
you know and actually too it's like it's

1524
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:24,960
interesting in the sense that i don't

1525
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,480
even know if i should bring this up but

1526
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,079
i have a i have a daughter that's i have

1527
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,880
a couple daughters in middle school

1528
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,400
right

1529
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
and it's one of their big issues right

1530
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,519
now

1531
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,400
is edibles

1532
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:36,079
really

1533
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,318
think about it taking animals to school

1534
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,839
yeah they're easy to mask

1535
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:41,119
an older brother an older sister or

1536
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:42,400
someone that's willing to go and buy

1537
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,800
them and kick them down

1538
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,039
yeah they're sour patch kids they're

1539
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,880
made in a bunch of attractive ways now

1540
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,800
like when we were kids the only way you

1541
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,960
got edibles is if some degenerate older

1542
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,480
brother made some brownies yeah exactly

1543
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,079
off some shake or something like that

1544
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,400
was able to stink up their whole house

1545
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,920
or some [ __ ] yeah now they can get like

1546
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,160
these really attractive much more

1547
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,599
controllable packages

1548
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:05,519
right they're you're not going to get

1549
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,240
caught with a lighter or a pipe or

1550
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,960
stinking like weed or anything like that

1551
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,799
you can just eat like a 10 milligram

1552
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,000
yeah right and so they're a lot more

1553
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,800
prevalent

1554
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,280
makes sense nerds ropes sour patch kids

1555
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,240
rice krispie treats all kinds of there's

1556
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:25,119
an immense amount of baking

1557
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:27,118
and candy and [ __ ] and much more

1558
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,240
controllable amounts

1559
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,920
um that uh i just don't like it

1560
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:33,919
and i'm not what you're saying is kids

1561
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,480
are good customers

1562
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,240
no you know i just mean that kids kids

1563
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,000
are going to get access to whatever is

1564
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,078
cool that's available in their local

1565
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,358
area and it's easy to smuggle in i mean

1566
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,039
i remember back in high school they

1567
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,519
would do like locker raids and all kinds

1568
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:49,440
of [ __ ] trying to catch us dealing drugs

1569
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,599
and uh we didn't have things like you

1570
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,440
know gummy bears and [ __ ] like that yeah

1571
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,720
if you if you if you took out some of

1572
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,760
those gummy bears if you took out some

1573
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:59,199
sour patch kids from a from a an edible

1574
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,960
thing you got and you put them in a real

1575
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:03,279
sour patch kids thing and took them in

1576
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,440
your lunchbox or your thing or backpack

1577
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,760
how would they [ __ ] know exactly yeah

1578
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,800
invisible at that point you know

1579
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,160
um

1580
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,680
but you know so i just uh i just i just

1581
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,879
don't like edibles

1582
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,519
you know

1583
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,440
i just don't like edibles um but

1584
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,800
um we kind of got off we kind of got off

1585
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,079
track there or whatever but it's like a

1586
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,440
big thing

1587
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,519
you know and some people are into them

1588
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,039
but they steal they steal my they steal

1589
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,280
my equilibrium i don't know if they

1590
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,119
steal other people's equilibrium

1591
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,880
but i start

1592
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,640
not feeling the right way and then i get

1593
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,920
hot

1594
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,078
yeah and when you get hot and you have

1595
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,318
the spins i mean how fun is that yeah

1596
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,440
you end up puking that's enough it's not

1597
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,039
fun for me

1598
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,838
yeah you know

1599
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,759
but

1600
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,358
you know and i i think it'll probably

1601
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,960
take like it would probably take like

1602
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:50,078
international

1603
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,119
freedom

1604
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,519
where weed really becomes opened up

1605
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,358
you know yeah for americans

1606
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,920
over here at least to really start

1607
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:02,078
trying like the finest grades

1608
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,200
of imported hashish

1609
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,200
i just don't see i i see the

1610
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,799
the world opening up and it being so

1611
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,078
super corporate and hyper illegal that

1612
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,039
nobody's going to be [ __ ] with [ __ ]

1613
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,119
like that

1614
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,318
you know it's going to be in afghanistan

1615
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,640
they'll have

1616
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:17,838
those small clubs and all that [ __ ]

1617
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,759
it'll be just

1618
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:21,119
that culture infiltrating everywhere as

1619
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,559
opposed to letting the cultures that are

1620
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,720
there stay there being able to try each

1621
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,240
other's cultures uh

1622
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,399
who knows there's money to be made off

1623
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:32,000
this [ __ ] you know right now you know

1624
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,480
you can get you can get greek olive oil

1625
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,239
you know you can get those iberian hams

1626
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,039
that cost eighteen hundred dollars for

1627
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,558
the leg that have been dry aged x amount

1628
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,159
you know there's a lot of debt

1629
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,559
you know what you can't get

1630
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,799
thai land races anymore it's very very

1631
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,240
hard things are disappearing not just

1632
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,079
the not just the strains but the

1633
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,598
cultures are disappearing with them in

1634
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,240
some senses and granted that's not a

1635
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,519
hash culture necessarily but it's just

1636
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,118
like just like those strains

1637
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:58,318
disappearing i mean it's you know the

1638
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,200
techniques are going to be going with

1639
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:00,318
them

1640
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:02,159
over time

1641
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,759
so you know people are saying people are

1642
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:05,679
talking about people paying more for six

1643
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,160
star or whatever else so

1644
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,440
there's an aspect where

1645
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:10,879
you know there's obviously different

1646
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,079
grades

1647
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,240
right

1648
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,079
but no matter how pure you make it

1649
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:17,199
you're still limited by your starting

1650
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,960
material

1651
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,558
yeah are you all getting it from a

1652
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,480
single source

1653
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,480
right is it all the same cultivar is all

1654
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,240
the same cut are you getting it from a

1655
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,639
field are you getting it from uh you

1656
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,639
know you planted thousands of seeds and

1657
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,920
you're harvesting those females

1658
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:34,879
yeah you know

1659
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,639
um and uh and all that and so

1660
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,519
uh you know there's an aspect there

1661
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,639
where

1662
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,480
um

1663
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,078
you know because you're gonna cut hash

1664
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,000
is concentrated right

1665
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,519
yeah where you're gonna concentrate what

1666
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,280
was in the flower

1667
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,679
yeah you're gonna concentrate the

1668
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,559
qualities of that of that thc or that

1669
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,318
blend or that cbd cbn terpene

1670
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,240
profile all that you know what do they

1671
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:58,400
call it entourage effect

1672
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:59,759
yes you know so you just you're going to

1673
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,680
get a vastly different experience

1674
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,799
probably from moroccan from lebanese to

1675
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,159
afghanistan to southeast asian to

1676
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:07,838
sherbolotto

1677
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,199
yeah

1678
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:10,880
right

1679
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,000
yes sure

1680
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,680
sure

1681
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,838
and then a lot of times too people

1682
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:18,480
people still like even makers right now

1683
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:20,558
it's like oh my god this is unbelievable

1684
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,480
the terpenes off it are amazing but it

1685
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,599
yielded two percent so [ __ ] it i'm not

1686
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,719
gonna do it

1687
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,559
yeah right people want hash dumpers

1688
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,959
yeah it's gotta it's gotta be

1689
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,839
commercially viable

1690
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,679
first

1691
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,279
or it won't get beyond some small little

1692
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,960
circle there might be some there might

1693
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,640
be a few friends that like wash it and

1694
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,720
they're all trading grams amongst each

1695
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,279
other and all stoked but it won't

1696
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,959
trickle down to where the normal person

1697
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,920
can get it because it wasn't a viable

1698
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,000
amount

1699
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,000
exactly and i'm not a hash guy that that

1700
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,920
big or whatever but i do know from

1701
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,079
working in legal cannabis and stuff like

1702
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,599
that that there's minimum numbers of

1703
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,318
weight return that you need to get to

1704
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:01,119
make it be viable yeah to pay for your

1705
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:03,039
time to pay for the equipment to pay for

1706
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,039
the the shift work and all the stuff

1707
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,880
that goes into making hash so if it

1708
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:10,239
doesn't dump enough

1709
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,240
regardless of how nice it affects you

1710
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,838
yeah it's going to get it's gonna get

1711
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,838
shifted to the side

1712
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,078
yeah and if you've got something that

1713
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,679
that blows your head off but it yields

1714
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,680
three and a half percent

1715
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,039
and its sister plant

1716
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,838
tastes a little bit different and

1717
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,039
doesn't work as good but yields six

1718
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:28,798
percent yeah the six percent is getting

1719
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:32,159
run and washed all day

1720
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:33,440
yeah because that's making them money

1721
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,239
you know

1722
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,639
so

1723
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:38,639
um you know so there's that too where

1724
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:39,920
it's like the commercial side of it

1725
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:41,440
people might think oh we have the best

1726
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,119
hash in the world but

1727
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,119
unless it's commercially viable you'll

1728
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,640
probably never see it

1729
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,160
unless you're growing it and washing it

1730
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,920
and making it yourself

1731
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,318
yeah or in your small circle of friends

1732
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,318
and trading it amongst each other

1733
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,400
just like you know just like before like

1734
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:57,519
if you were growing a 12 or 13 or 14

1735
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,880
week plant

1736
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,880
you'd probably never be able to buy that

1737
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,039
in a store

1738
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,119
yeah i wouldn't think so gmo is probably

1739
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,798
the first thing that came out that took

1740
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,960
12 weeks

1741
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,798
that people were willing to jump on

1742
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,880
yeah that always shocked me especially

1743
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,159
coming from the cookies well part of the

1744
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,358
reason part of the reason why i think

1745
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,118
people were willing to jump on it was

1746
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:18,798
because even though it took two weeks

1747
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,039
four weeks longer than they wanted or

1748
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,719
three weeks longer than they wanted it

1749
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,358
dumped like crazy

1750
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:27,118
yeah and it tested super high

1751
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,679
and it smelled like chem d and kmd was

1752
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,480
not everywhere yeah so it like so you

1753
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:34,078
know there so the yield made it worth it

1754
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,559
yeah right where if the yield doesn't

1755
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,559
make the extra time worth it i mean matt

1756
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,160
and i joke that like i mean there's some

1757
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,480
pretty famous breeders out there that

1758
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:43,920
are like if it takes any longer than 63

1759
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,559
days it's [ __ ]

1760
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,880
yeah or i'm harvesting it early

1761
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,559
yeah i've got this banger colombian and

1762
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,240
it takes 11 weeks but i don't take it

1763
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,839
longer than 63 days because it doesn't

1764
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,838
fit my model

1765
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,759
yeah

1766
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,759
you know

1767
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,559
and that's kind of how that rolls

1768
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,359
yeah

1769
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,200
and american way the american well it's

1770
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,679
just it's it's there's a difference

1771
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:09,759
between quality and commercial

1772
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,159
yeah and that's what i mean too about

1773
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,000
about like for instance the uh the wine

1774
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:15,838
industry is now there's enough education

1775
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,119
in the wine industry

1776
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,279
that

1777
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,559
a certain seven or eight year old

1778
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,400
cabernet

1779
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,359
from a certain winery in a certain

1780
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,760
region

1781
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:28,159
you can get that extra ducats

1782
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,839
to make that a viable product

1783
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:31,759
right now cannabis doesn't have enough

1784
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:33,838
of that separation

1785
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,480
to make the rare and the cool and the

1786
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:38,159
expensive worth it

1787
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,240
right there's all there's like this

1788
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:41,759
range that everybody's working in and we

1789
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:43,838
haven't gotten educated enough that you

1790
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,680
could be like you should pay more for

1791
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:48,239
this weed because it's neville's haze

1792
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,358
and it takes 15 weeks and you know it

1793
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:50,719
does this

1794
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:53,440
eventually you'll have people that are

1795
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,679
willing to throw down for that

1796
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,159
yeah right right now you don't

1797
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:59,519
right right now it's just it's it's you

1798
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:01,440
don't you know

1799
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,280
and so until you get that level of

1800
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,519
education until you get that consumer

1801
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,440
willing to pay for it i honestly think

1802
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,639
like the reason why

1803
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,880
people are going to yell at me for this

1804
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:13,279
but i think the reason why freaking uh

1805
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,400
hayes did so well in new york

1806
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,400
right

1807
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,039
was because there was there was

1808
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,119
musicians and rich people and wall

1809
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:21,920
street brokers to sell it to

1810
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,079
yeah

1811
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,480
they could they could sell them a higher

1812
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:29,680
grade

1813
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,280
yeah straight up just like that you know

1814
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:34,318
i mean do you think kush would have been

1815
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:37,280
so popular in in la if it wasn't 7 200 a

1816
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:38,960
pound wholesale oh yeah no never it was

1817
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,280
an aspect of it where

1818
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,960
where it became massive because in l.a

1819
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,119
it was like oh this is expensive and

1820
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,920
exclusive and it's not in your bag

1821
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,519
yeah

1822
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,440
and then people wanted what the what

1823
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,440
what people had it

1824
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,679
yeah right and people were willing to

1825
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,200
pay a [ __ ] ton for it

1826
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:57,358
but we really haven't gotten there with

1827
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,598
weed yet too much there's individual

1828
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:00,798
things that break through here and there

1829
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,280
but we really haven't gotten the

1830
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:05,838
criteria as to like why

1831
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,680
this weed or why this hash is nicer and

1832
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:09,039
should be more expensive

1833
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:10,960
yeah

1834
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:12,639
you know um

1835
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,159
you know i mean i even saw there was

1836
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,239
there was some [ __ ] i can't remember

1837
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,558
what it was i you know i see that uh you

1838
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:20,318
know uh chimera is on here he was

1839
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,400
talking earlier this week about he's got

1840
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:25,199
rks that he doesn't want to release

1841
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,000
because it's got unique traits in it

1842
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:28,078
that

1843
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,760
he wants to utilize later

1844
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,359
yeah and he doesn't think the market's

1845
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,119
ready for it

1846
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,639
whatever those traits might be

1847
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,440
you know

1848
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,879
and that could be that could be true too

1849
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,880
there's lots of times the market isn't

1850
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,880
ready for anything i've always been very

1851
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,119
good at being um

1852
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,880
at the forefront of stuff and absolutely

1853
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,240
making no sells being at the forefront

1854
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,079
of stuff and watching others come and

1855
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,279
clean up with it it's just about hitting

1856
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,798
it at the right time when the market's

1857
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,319
ready for something i mean we talked

1858
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:56,159
about that before too like all that

1859
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:59,039
super dog work that me and my and my

1860
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,519
homie did you know yeah um that was like

1861
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:03,039
years before american seed sellers could

1862
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,679
really get a toehold

1863
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,880
yeah we had no place for it to go

1864
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:10,159
yeah

1865
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,358
you know we had no place for it to go

1866
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,199
you know

1867
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,558
so um

1868
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,239
uh you know it's it's got to be the

1869
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,359
right it's got it there's got to be a

1870
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:21,358
balance between commercially viable

1871
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:23,598
and fire

1872
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:25,679
yeah and it has to match

1873
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,440
you know so i don't know right now it's

1874
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:29,440
like we've been in we we went to war

1875
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,119
with afghanistan for 20 years so it's

1876
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,880
probably not the uh

1877
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,480
um it's probably not the best time to go

1878
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,519
over there as a white guy

1879
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,400
and

1880
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:40,880
start looking around for hashish and and

1881
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,880
rare things like that you know yeah you

1882
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,960
can get taliban or whatever

1883
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,480
um but

1884
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,720
you know but uh

1885
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,679
um but they actually have a real culture

1886
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,759
over there

1887
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,118
yeah they have a real vibrant hashish

1888
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,200
culture

1889
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:57,200
and it's just separated from us

1890
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:59,439
you know it's always a trip to me with

1891
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:01,598
how how um

1892
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,240
religiously conservative those areas are

1893
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,720
but there still is a breeding culture or

1894
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:09,679
a weed culture there you know

1895
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:11,118
this is so counter to the muslim culture

1896
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:13,118
i just you know it's like i think it's

1897
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:16,400
one of those things where it's like uh

1898
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:19,280
it predated you know predated the that

1899
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,200
whole thing yeah it's just it's it's it

1900
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,798
was just kind of like how

1901
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,639
you know like you know there's any

1902
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:26,880
number of different things where like

1903
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:29,440
christianity just absorbs certain pagan

1904
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,119
rituals into itself oh yeah that's true

1905
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,240
good because they because they couldn't

1906
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,318
get rid of it

1907
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:35,199
yeah they co-opted it

1908
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:37,119
right

1909
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:38,798
yeah so you want to bring you want to

1910
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,160
bring allah to

1911
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,000
afghanistan you're going to have to

1912
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:43,838
incorporate some hashish

1913
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,199
yeah because it's ancient there and they

1914
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:46,400
ain't getting rid

1915
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:47,439
yeah should have done that with

1916
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,680
christians

1917
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,318
you know better here yeah i mean well

1918
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:56,399
you know they i mean they it just it

1919
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:56,400
just didn't it's probably an anomaly

1920
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:01,838
yeah know like it's an accident

1921
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,960
you know um

1922
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,480
and you know they probably didn't

1923
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,559
realize how much effect they were gonna

1924
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,039
have a thousand years later or two

1925
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,960
thousand years later i'm sure

1926
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,039
in the in in that regard

1927
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,318
you know yeah

1928
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:16,799
so

1929
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:19,038
but yeah i mean hash

1930
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,038
you know the the hash in america is

1931
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,000
moving along really quickly

1932
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:27,119
uh and i wish i could go back to

1933
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,679
um maybe i will sometime and go back and

1934
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,599
um and talk in in holland and stuff like

1935
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:33,519
that and see what what they have right

1936
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,280
now is their best stuff

1937
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,358
yeah that'd be interesting to know

1938
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,640
and just how it affects you

1939
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,719
yeah because that's what they all talk

1940
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:43,598
about is the the flavor and the effect

1941
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,439
is just unused can't you just can't get

1942
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:48,318
it in other [ __ ]

1943
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:51,440
i'll be the judge of that [ __ ]

1944
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:53,199
you know yeah i don't know yeah

1945
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,480
but and they also even back when i was

1946
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:57,279
going back there a bunch it was like

1947
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,719
they would grab you know like you know a

1948
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,880
certain amount of kilos would hit

1949
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:02,159
amsterdam and it would all get bought up

1950
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,680
by collectors

1951
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,440
and then they all sit on it and hope

1952
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,919
that they didn't run out before they

1953
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,358
found something else of that quality

1954
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,039
yeah and so they'd have a chunk of this

1955
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:12,960
and a chunk of this and a chunk of that

1956
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,319
and you know so on and so forth and

1957
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,519
whatnot

1958
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:17,440
and that's what you know they they'd

1959
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,920
smoke they'd smoke they they'd almost

1960
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,760
keep flour for the americans

1961
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,318
yeah and then show you and then they'd

1962
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,760
show you what they really were into

1963
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:27,038
yeah

1964
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,240
in that regard

1965
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,079
you know

1966
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:33,279
um and

1967
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,839
you know and so uh you know we're

1968
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,920
we

1969
01:05:34,838 --> 01:05:39,679
uh i don't know maybe maybe there's a

1970
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,000
there's an aspect with america where we

1971
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:45,440
blend we blended a bunch of the smoking

1972
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,358
weed with a bunch of the hashish weed

1973
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,400
what do you mean kind of create huh what

1974
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,480
do you mean

1975
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,720
well you know we took stuff that was

1976
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,760
bred for smoking like

1977
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:56,399
thai

1978
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,520
colombian and and mexican and things of

1979
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,440
that nature

1980
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:00,798
and then we blended it with all this

1981
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,079
stuff that was

1982
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:05,838
specifically designed for hashish yeah

1983
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,760
like all the afghans that came over

1984
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,078
originally yeah

1985
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,440
that was all bred exclusively for

1986
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,760
they did they weren't going for like

1987
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,400
does this flower taste good

1988
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,200
yeah they never tasted the flower

1989
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,240
right

1990
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:22,239
yeah they hashed it

1991
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:23,358
but the hash had to taste have a taste

1992
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:24,719
of its own

1993
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,798
you know yeah but it's like everyone

1994
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:28,000
it's different when you're burning aged

1995
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,318
hash

1996
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,358
that's versus versus like a bunch of

1997
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:35,279
flower material yeah

1998
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:37,598
you know and so we started figuring all

1999
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,280
that out and we started blending it with

2000
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,798
sativas and blending it with different

2001
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,839
things and trying to see how they all

2002
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:43,679
came out

2003
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,679
yeah you know it's weird in the sense

2004
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:47,679
that like america and holland sort of

2005
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:50,078
became the two places i should say

2006
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,838
canada too north america

2007
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,039
sort of became where like all the

2008
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:57,599
various regions of weed started blending

2009
01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:00,400
yeah you could probably put australia in

2010
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:02,318
that category

2011
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,760
that sounds like it sounds like i don't

2012
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,679
have a lot of familiarity with over

2013
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,920
there but like it sounds like australia

2014
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,519
was another melting pot where they got a

2015
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,039
bunch of southeast asian weed and they

2016
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:12,079
got a bunch of uh

2017
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,480
um

2018
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,798
they got a bunch of indian and

2019
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,318
afghanistan and pakistan and blends of

2020
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:19,119
different stuff you know

2021
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:21,199
yeah

2022
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,039
and whatnot and so

2023
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,399
you know it uh

2024
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,160
and there was people too maybe we could

2025
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,559
switch we could switch bases for a

2026
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:31,118
second there was people that were asking

2027
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,359
which is more matt's world than mine uh

2028
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,280
i can let him talk for a minute about

2029
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:37,920
what the what the internet what the seed

2030
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,839
market is like outside of us

2031
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,200
like outside of the us

2032
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:44,960
outside of our like little sts reversals

2033
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:47,038
like what everyone's familiar with oh

2034
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,838
this guy's dropping caps dropping

2035
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,480
something matt's dropping something csi

2036
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:54,159
has a drop here comes these people

2037
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,798
you know because we're used to like very

2038
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,639
small scale um

2039
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,318
you know like and i think probably most

2040
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:02,239
people think of the last 10 years as

2041
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:04,639
what's normal

2042
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:05,519
yeah but that's not i would think so

2043
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:07,118
yeah

2044
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,199
but that's not really what's out there

2045
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,280
but you know obviously like so maybe you

2046
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,598
could talk for a minute about like what

2047
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,039
what is it like out there

2048
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,039
well i mean like

2049
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,400
so like someone like chimera that's been

2050
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,399
around before me he's gonna have a

2051
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,719
different experience than when i entered

2052
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,639
when i entered in you had to [ __ ] with

2053
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,480
europeans or your seeds weren't going to

2054
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,000
sell you know if you weren't [ __ ]

2055
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:30,158
with european seed bank and were trying

2056
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,479
to do direct you had a very very small

2057
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:33,920
chance of getting any meaningful sales

2058
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,599
because people wanted to buy from seed

2059
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,600
banks seed banks were known there wasn't

2060
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,679
a lot of places to do exchanges you

2061
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,440
could always you know do it get down in

2062
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,679
the dms on different forums and stuff

2063
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,519
but that was that was really not cool

2064
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,199
like it wasn't looked at as a cool thing

2065
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,080
to do by the the forum owners because

2066
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:51,919
they were they were kind of taking uh

2067
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:54,158
some risk for your exchange even though

2068
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,798
it was done in the dms it's still on

2069
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,798
their server and transactions so it

2070
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:00,000
wasn't looked upon positively by a lot

2071
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:02,238
of the the

2072
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,079
the uh forum owners for anybody to be

2073
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,639
doing any exchanges of any sorts and

2074
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:08,640
usually you'd get banned from uh places

2075
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,119
for doing anything of the sort

2076
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,119
um so we were we were

2077
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:15,198
mostly counting on um

2078
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:17,838
when i entered in it had just started

2079
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,439
the british and uh

2080
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:22,079
attitude wasn't a thing when i first

2081
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,238
started um but yeah most of it was

2082
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:28,158
outside of the us i think kevin stairway

2083
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:30,959
was was that canada or that or u.s

2084
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:33,519
i think uh canada

2085
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,279
i think it was canada

2086
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,400
is it canada where calrissian was i

2087
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,440
believe so

2088
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:39,439
yeah i mean

2089
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,440
you had the canadian seed banks a lot of

2090
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,039
them wouldn't pick up american folks i

2091
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,879
remember um

2092
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:49,039
med user chris

2093
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,199
over at woodhorse seeds he was really

2094
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:52,640
not friendly to most americans um hemp

2095
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:54,319
depot

2096
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,719
was around but you still had a hard time

2097
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:58,719
getting them to pick up most americans

2098
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:02,239
so being an american you had the choice

2099
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:04,399
mostly of british or if you were lucky

2100
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:06,639
like a a dutch seed bank would pick you

2101
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:09,359
up but yeah it's

2102
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,440
it was minimal a lot of it like when

2103
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:13,519
when i got booted off the attitude

2104
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:16,399
subcool had asked it basically gave that

2105
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,840
given them a uh ultimatum me or him and

2106
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:19,759
at the time there was just me and him

2107
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,319
that were the americans on there

2108
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,280
when i left the attitude and uh

2109
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:26,639
unceremoniously left

2110
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,399
um

2111
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,840
i had to to figure out what was i gonna

2112
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:31,439
do was i gonna take the risk be the one

2113
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,840
american trying to

2114
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:36,559
sell direct or was i going to just find

2115
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,800
another seed bank and get [ __ ] so

2116
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,840
first thing i did was try to operate a

2117
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,679
seed bank with a few other americans and

2118
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,719
unfortunately chose the brothel brothers

2119
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,440
who were notorious scammers and they got

2120
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:48,960
me

2121
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:51,279
and eventually i just learned [ __ ] i

2122
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,319
gotta do this myself or it's it's not

2123
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:54,479
gonna work

2124
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,479
and from there you know i mean

2125
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,000
you could be operating great in the us

2126
01:10:56,479 --> 01:10:59,919
but if you weren't taking credit cards

2127
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,920
like the europeans then you just weren't

2128
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,760
going to be any sort of competition and

2129
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,039
those were always going to get the the

2130
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,520
sales

2131
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:09,600
nowadays it's a lot different nowadays

2132
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,000
there's all sorts of direct buying uh

2133
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,360
instagram kind of changed a lot you know

2134
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,760
instagram made everyone a lot more

2135
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:17,119
accessible um seeds were a lot easier to

2136
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,400
sell because people weren't as

2137
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:21,198
interested in effect they were more

2138
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:23,279
interested in learning uh by looking you

2139
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:26,238
know oh that's pretty that look that

2140
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:28,719
looks dank became a real catchphrase

2141
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:29,839
during instagram oh that looks dank

2142
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,039
but i mean

2143
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,719
back in the day we kind of knew that

2144
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:35,359
looks didn't mean anything when it came

2145
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,640
to dangerous i mean yeah the weird thing

2146
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,119
let me interject for a second because

2147
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,920
i'm saying stuff in the comments is that

2148
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:43,599
america was an enormous seed market

2149
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,719
yes but everyone that tried to deal with

2150
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,360
america

2151
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,119
typically got in trouble yeah so

2152
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:51,599
everyone in europe you know when they

2153
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:54,719
saw what happened in neville um yeah the

2154
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,560
super sativa seed club just shut down

2155
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,480
and a lot of

2156
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,360
you know seed banks became very hesitant

2157
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:03,759
to ship stuff to america yeah and then

2158
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:06,399
canadian seed banks sort of took over

2159
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,719
that that role for a minute and started

2160
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:10,559
being willing to ship stuff to america

2161
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,239
um and a lot of times they sort of like

2162
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,320
took the reins from europe because

2163
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:15,919
europe would send it to canada

2164
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,799
yeah you know and it would get and it

2165
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,399
would get filtered through but as as uh

2166
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,880
you know camaro was mentioning a few

2167
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,158
minutes ago um heaven stairway went down

2168
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,480
because there was an intercepted

2169
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:28,719
shipment to the united states and that

2170
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:30,158
got cannabis world and overgrowth shut

2171
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,920
down at the same time

2172
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:33,839
and well

2173
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,760
and we we're going to do a full episode

2174
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,520
on this me and flan but it's we're going

2175
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,960
to go into detail on um silk road

2176
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,159
heaven stairway

2177
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,000
overgrow

2178
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,279
icy mag and how they were all related in

2179
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,600
the big bust

2180
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,519
this is over a period of several years

2181
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,400
almost i mean it's people are still

2182
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,199
being prosecuted from one major [ __ ] up

2183
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:55,359
yeah

2184
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:57,678
and then that's one of those why i used

2185
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:58,719
to go to amsterdam to buy seed in the

2186
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:00,239
90s

2187
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,480
was because that was the most reliable

2188
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,158
way to get it uh getting it shipped over

2189
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:06,399
was very difficult you know and a lot of

2190
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:08,719
people wouldn't do it uh mark emery who

2191
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:10,559
had you know cannabis culture magazine

2192
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,880
uh and all that and he had his whole

2193
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,480
seed company um he ended up doing i

2194
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,920
don't know five-ish years or something

2195
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,718
like that in america

2196
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,560
in prison for seed sales

2197
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:23,279
um so there was a big issue with

2198
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:25,039
america's this voracious seed market

2199
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:27,920
but how do you get

2200
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:28,880
seeds there without getting in trouble

2201
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,239
yeah

2202
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,159
and so

2203
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:34,479
you know there wasn't you know people on

2204
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,479
ig now you can see all these things and

2205
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,799
that's why i was joking about you know

2206
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:40,639
oh this guy's got a drop coming

2207
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,079
you know when 20 years ago or whatever

2208
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,199
when i was doing a bunch of breeding

2209
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:47,279
work um there was no outlet to get that

2210
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:49,678
to anyone yeah there was no way to

2211
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:52,399
advertise it there was no way to set up

2212
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:55,600
shipping there was no way to i mean even

2213
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,719
like somebody like dj short who um

2214
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,000
ended up working with a bunch of

2215
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,359
canadians

2216
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,039
part of the reason why he worked with so

2217
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:02,719
many people was that in order for his

2218
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,679
sweet his stuff to get out there he had

2219
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:07,359
to work with tony from sag martha first

2220
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:10,000
yeah and then he ended up working with

2221
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:12,158
the dutch passion crew i think yeah i

2222
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,679
think a dutch passion and he ended up

2223
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,399
not liking that and then he ended up

2224
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,319
working with various people up in canada

2225
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:20,799
but he had to work with third parties

2226
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:23,840
because there was no way for him

2227
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:26,079
to safely distribute advertise and

2228
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,440
communicate with people from america to

2229
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:29,600
get seeds out

2230
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:33,039
yeah so it really wasn't until social

2231
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,440
media exploded and ig exploded and

2232
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:37,439
proposition 215 and medical started

2233
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,639
spreading enough that it started calming

2234
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,879
down

2235
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,239
for all these seed companies

2236
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,600
like you know think about all the

2237
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:47,198
popular you know

2238
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:49,120
cap or or you know swamp boys or these

2239
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:51,519
people you know cookie anybody

2240
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:53,920
right all these people came up and their

2241
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,480
possibilities started

2242
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,039
in the social media iga

2243
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:01,439
yeah so what matt's talking about is how

2244
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:04,719
difficult it was as an american seed

2245
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:07,919
breeder to even find a home

2246
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,600
that could that could be a middleman

2247
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,719
that could get they could get your seeds

2248
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,400
out to people so you know my buddy

2249
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:15,840
that uh that i you know he doesn't like

2250
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,879
to be mentioned but my buddy i call

2251
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:21,279
staten island he kept talking about like

2252
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,600
the potential for seeds

2253
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:24,399
and i was totally dismissive

2254
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,880
right

2255
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,920
and we were both right

2256
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:32,400
right at the time i was right

2257
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,679
what he saw 10 or 15 years down the road

2258
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:34,559
what was coming

2259
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,359
yeah

2260
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,960
you know he did he he saw it but it just

2261
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:41,279
wasn't there yet

2262
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,359
i remember making that that

2263
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:46,559
shift from um

2264
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:48,319
cash cropping i mean it's a very very

2265
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,320
clear memory for me when i had to make

2266
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:51,920
that choice of [ __ ]

2267
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:54,000
i can cash crop

2268
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,399
or i can make seeds i'm learning i

2269
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,920
cannot do both you know and having to

2270
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:00,719
make something that i know i know i can

2271
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,158
make enough money to survive

2272
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,600
growing

2273
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:05,519
since mia

2274
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,360
that's not what i love to do

2275
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,199
you know that way that did that slowly

2276
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:11,359
was not my passion anymore my passion

2277
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:13,119
was making seeds and and learning what i

2278
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:16,238
could create you know what could be

2279
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:18,719
created in these rooms and uh having to

2280
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,319
make that decision to only go to siege

2281
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,079
was a tough one because at the time it

2282
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:23,920
was very risky there wasn't a lot of

2283
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,840
money in seeds i mean granted

2284
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,840
greenhouses killing it dna was killing

2285
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,199
it but americans just weren't killing it

2286
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,679
at that level yet

2287
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:34,639
i mean dna we can talk about dna for a

2288
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:37,039
second those are two americans plumber

2289
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,880
and the stunt cop yeah and they

2290
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:40,560
you know they they went to humboldt and

2291
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,560
mendo and all these different places and

2292
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,520
they gathered up a bunch of seed and a

2293
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,360
bunch of clones from various friends

2294
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,560
but they had to go to holland to make a

2295
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:50,799
seed company

2296
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,120
yeah there was no there was no in the

2297
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,880
early 2000s there was no way they were

2298
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,920
going to do an american-based seed

2299
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,920
company

2300
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,359
how would they even get a hold of you

2301
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,199
yeah how would you get a hold of them

2302
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:04,399
how would you not get busted

2303
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:07,039
yeah you know it was uh it wasn't it

2304
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:09,439
wasn't very easy and so we basically

2305
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,119
worked first through holland

2306
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:12,879
and that's kind of why holland became

2307
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:14,559
the epicenter

2308
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,199
was it allowed it

2309
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:18,719
yeah right neville got lucky because he

2310
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:21,039
had balls

2311
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:24,079
and a bunch of american breeders were

2312
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:26,238
fleeing prosecution in america

2313
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,479
and bringing him stuff

2314
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:30,158
right and you know he got stuff from

2315
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:31,839
from greg and he got stuff from sam

2316
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:34,000
skunk man and he and he got stuff

2317
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,239
through mel frank and jorge cervantes

2318
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,079
and he got stuff from jim ortega

2319
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:39,759
all these people

2320
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:40,960
you know because that was the place that

2321
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,800
it could go

2322
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,239
yeah and then when canada became the

2323
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,279
place it could go that's where it all

2324
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:47,119
went

2325
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:48,639
and then when california and oregon and

2326
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:50,319
washington started being the place that

2327
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,719
it could go that's where it went

2328
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,559
yeah and it really sucks

2329
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:57,198
because there's this artificial line

2330
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,520
between america and canada

2331
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:01,359
that sort of kept our two cultures it's

2332
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,560
made it a lot more difficult

2333
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:03,519
to

2334
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,800
huh

2335
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:09,199
i'm not gonna lie between 2007 and 2010

2336
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,119
the fact that it was such a small market

2337
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:13,439
it was [ __ ] killer you didn't have

2338
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:15,599
all kinds of competition i mean the the

2339
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,000
best competition i had was like swerve

2340
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,560
and sub at the time and rascal you know

2341
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,560
for americans and rascal was he was at

2342
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,719
the top of the the food chain when it

2343
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,480
came to reversals but i mean

2344
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:28,319
sub and swerve you know

2345
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:31,039
yeah no i i mean there's there's there's

2346
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,719
an aspect of it but it's like that

2347
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,640
you know um

2348
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,640
people think that like people don't

2349
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:39,600
realize how long it took

2350
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:42,079
to get to get democracy where some guy

2351
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,320
in a garage could have a 15 lighter or

2352
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:45,920
two or three four lighters or whatever

2353
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,880
yeah and make some breeding and do a

2354
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,279
drop

2355
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:52,880
yeah and advertise the drop

2356
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:54,800
and let uh and let everyone know

2357
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,079
that it was coming

2358
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,880
you know i was just thinking about

2359
01:18:56,079 --> 01:19:00,960
something as far as drops go like i

2360
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,840
remember when that was looked at very

2361
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,319
negatively if you're gonna do a drop

2362
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,319
meaning can hit one male to more than

2363
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:09,920
five or six plants you were a shitty

2364
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:12,319
pollen chucker and that was like a mark

2365
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,399
of shame like drops were not a thing and

2366
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:16,960
now that's the common accepted way this

2367
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:19,198
clone or this male crossed x amount of

2368
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,279
clones and that's the accepted way but

2369
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:22,799
back in the day that was not you were

2370
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:24,479
not looked at favorably i mean that's

2371
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,079
what i did so i'm not looking down on

2372
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,319
anyone for doing it i was one of the

2373
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:30,238
people looked down on not favorable for

2374
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:32,319
doing those i mean we talked about it

2375
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:35,678
before but you know 12 or 14 years ago

2376
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:37,759
the four or five guys uh doing reversals

2377
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,199
were looked upon as cheating

2378
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,360
yeah it's cheating you're ruining the

2379
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:43,519
[ __ ] you are ruining genetics for

2380
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:45,519
good you're ruining the gene pool you're

2381
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,679
eliminating males you're taking

2382
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,360
shortcuts you're doing this [ __ ] up

2383
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:51,840
thing that shouldn't be done

2384
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:53,119
you're trying to do shortcuts to make a

2385
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,319
quick buck

2386
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:57,679
yep um and it went from that and it was

2387
01:19:56,319 --> 01:19:59,119
you know i don't know

2388
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,760
uh

2389
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:03,439
emery is a douchebag i totally agree

2390
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,920
that he i think most people agree he's a

2391
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:08,079
kind that he is a he is a non-he is not

2392
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:11,119
a nice person um yeah

2393
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:12,800
by any means um you know i mean but

2394
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:14,559
you know there's a there's a lot of

2395
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,480
people that uh you know you get to know

2396
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,560
him and weed and you're like oh boy

2397
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,718
yeah he's not a good kisser but yeah but

2398
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,640
there's an aspect where it's like like

2399
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:26,960
we've talked about it what was it it was

2400
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:29,199
it was matt and rascal and hybe and

2401
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,640
uh a couple other a couple other people

2402
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:34,000
doing rehearsals

2403
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:35,039
yeah and it was a sea of of male female

2404
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,439
breeding

2405
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:39,119
yeah and now fast forward 12 years and

2406
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:41,359
it's completely reversed

2407
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,559
yeah it's like 98

2408
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:44,399
fems

2409
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,280
and 2 percent of people doing rag

2410
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:49,599
breeding yeah it's rare to see people do

2411
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:51,039
i've got a red seedline drop

2412
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,520
you know what's really weird too for me

2413
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,960
like i i don't do that many um

2414
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,239
fem seed runs anymore i really don't

2415
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,359
even though i sell the spray and i've

2416
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:00,000
been doing it a long time people

2417
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:02,880
associate me with that i i don't do them

2418
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,479
often i don't do them very often at all

2419
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,319
and i prefer regular seed breeding

2420
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:08,959
because it's so much easier it's like a

2421
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:11,920
[ __ ] free pass to not fail

2422
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:14,640
and uh yeah it's it's it's a totally

2423
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:17,039
different than people's uh ideas of what

2424
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:20,239
fem breeding is and how easy it is it's

2425
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:22,719
uh regular breeding is easy

2426
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:26,000
in the sense of getting actual

2427
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:27,439
successful pollination

2428
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,279
with real not that you're going to

2429
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:31,359
achieve your goals that's still the

2430
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:33,198
breeding is a lot of there's still a lot

2431
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,759
of dead ends and failure in my opinion

2432
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:38,000
and sure you know and all that but but

2433
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,920
you know feminized breeding even

2434
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,880
even getting pollen and getting viable

2435
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,239
pollen

2436
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,600
um you know uh people

2437
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:46,879
it's a crabs you people are saying i

2438
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,719
don't think the market's telling

2439
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,440
breeders what they want

2440
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,198
no

2441
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,719
i don't necessarily i don't think that's

2442
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:55,839
it i think that

2443
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,439
finding males is a bunch of

2444
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,520
and people

2445
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,759
started doing things where you can't get

2446
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,760
either one of these two elite cuttings

2447
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,119
but i'll give you a hybrid of them

2448
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,880
yeah you can't get tk by skittles

2449
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:11,039
yeah you know you can't get either cut

2450
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,719
but you can buy a hybrid from me

2451
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:14,800
and i think that's what started it and i

2452
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,480
think honestly it's like people buy

2453
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,199
what's available

2454
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:20,718
you know um and uh

2455
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,638
you know

2456
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,399
reversals just you just took an elite

2457
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,000
cut and you crossed it to another elite

2458
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,638
you took an elite cut and you threw that

2459
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,158
on 15 or 20 other cuts and boom you've

2460
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:32,960
got a seed drop

2461
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:35,599
yep and reversals actually really killed

2462
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,039
the the line breeding

2463
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,600
you know companies used to we were going

2464
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:40,800
to talk about simon today tonight right

2465
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,320
we're going to talk about sirius a

2466
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,400
little bit or whatever

2467
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:47,039
uh serious seeds they offered the same

2468
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:48,879
six lines for like [ __ ] 15 years

2469
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:51,840
yeah 20 years

2470
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:53,840
you know uh scentsy seed bank you know

2471
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,360
uh when neville was there or whatever

2472
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,119
probably matt and i were looking at a

2473
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:59,519
bunch of the catalogs

2474
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:02,079
they barely offered a new line for five

2475
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:04,320
or six years yeah it was the same as

2476
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:06,719
[ __ ] and then in the late 90s they added

2477
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:08,799
two or three more lines yeah back in the

2478
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:11,760
day they expected you to work on your

2479
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:14,079
line and refine it hopefully and you

2480
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,880
have those flagship strains yeah make

2481
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:19,439
those lines better over time now it's

2482
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,119
literally like i did this reversal i got

2483
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:22,638
x amount of seeds they're here until

2484
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:24,880
they're gone i probably won't make them

2485
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,679
again i gave it a name

2486
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,760
yeah

2487
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:30,239
you know but

2488
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,560
that's it there's no lines you can't you

2489
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:34,319
can't hit up you know um you could hit

2490
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,239
up serious seeds throughout the 90s and

2491
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:37,920
you could get ak-47 and you could get

2492
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:39,359
white russian and you could get chronic

2493
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,399
and you could get bubble gum and you

2494
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:42,639
could get

2495
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:44,559
um you know whatever

2496
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,760
right and it was just on on it was just

2497
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,080
available

2498
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,760
so let me let me use this point actually

2499
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:51,519
to tell a story and you'll like this

2500
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,600
story because it it has something to do

2501
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,480
with you so

2502
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:58,320
i gave natso some seeds a while back and

2503
01:23:56,479 --> 01:23:59,279
i i was pretty sure i remembered what i

2504
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:01,519
gave him

2505
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:04,158
right um i thought i gave him an old

2506
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,760
pack of ak-47 and i i was like man

2507
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:07,759
when's he gonna pop those [ __ ]

2508
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,840
and i would bust his balls over it like

2509
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,719
man where's those aka 47 get him pop

2510
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,119
he's like i don't know what you're

2511
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,520
talking about i'm like [ __ ] not so

2512
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:17,359
right so i bust his balls for at least a

2513
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,280
year and a half two years two years

2514
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:22,719
every time i lost his [ __ ] ancient

2515
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:24,719
seeds i'm the old seed guy i talk up ak

2516
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,880
like crazy all this different stuff he

2517
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,639
sends them to me not only do i not do

2518
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:31,600
anything with him but i [ __ ] him over by

2519
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:33,600
like not actually cracking them or like

2520
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,199
crack them i just [ __ ] ignored them

2521
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,199
and then i lost them and i keep telling

2522
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:38,319
them i don't have them over and over and

2523
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:39,839
over again

2524
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:42,639
and i'm like dude i gave you these

2525
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,239
[ __ ] seats what the [ __ ] so anyways i

2526
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:47,199
was busting his balls about him again

2527
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:48,238
probably i don't know a month ago yeah

2528
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:48,960
you know something like that not that

2529
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:50,238
long

2530
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,560
and someone i hadn't talked to for a

2531
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:53,839
long time skunk tech hits him up and is

2532
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,880
like hey you know i haven't talked to

2533
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,800
matt but let him know that i f2 those

2534
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:01,600
ak-47 seeds he gave me so

2535
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,440
oh i was so happy too because i called

2536
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,079
that up and i was like you're a dick

2537
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:08,399
dude you gave them to someone else

2538
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:10,079
and [ __ ] me and told me that i [ __ ]

2539
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:12,719
lost them and i didn't remember and i'm

2540
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,880
a stoner and [ __ ] yeah yeah

2541
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:18,399
you know you said i sent rare [ __ ] from

2542
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,400
the 90s and i blew it off

2543
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:22,639
but in fairness he still does have super

2544
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,639
skunk and devils haze over there

2545
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:26,480
but you know there's a there's a yeah i

2546
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:29,119
mean in fairness to me

2547
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:31,039
uh before 2017 there wasn't like

2548
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:33,279
biblical fires every year in my area

2549
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:35,198
yeah yeah yeah i don't mind the fires at

2550
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:36,800
all and so that that ruined a number of

2551
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:38,479
seed crops for me and gave me kind of

2552
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,039
some ptsd

2553
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:43,359
and all that but yeah i mean going back

2554
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:44,800
to going back to simon i mean can you

2555
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:47,519
imagine if

2556
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,199
you know whoever you know for the last

2557
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,960
five years the swamp boys have offered

2558
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:52,158
the same six lines

2559
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,000
yeah

2560
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:57,039
matt's offered the same six lines

2561
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,880
caleb's csi's offered the same 20.

2562
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:00,639
and they just remake them

2563
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,400
and that's what people are doing

2564
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:04,400
yeah and you get you're expected to work

2565
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,000
on all those lines and improve them but

2566
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:08,158
you can because you're only offering

2567
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,960
half a dozen

2568
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:12,158
now every seed drop is like [ __ ] 20

2569
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,000
things

2570
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:15,198
yeah at least usually you know and

2571
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,560
they're all given a name and they're all

2572
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:17,919
given packaging and they're all given

2573
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,600
this and they're all sold and that's

2574
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,039
that that's that

2575
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,560
and you'll likely never see them again

2576
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:23,920
because the person's not going to remake

2577
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,920
them

2578
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,760
and honestly the person the [ __ ] the

2579
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,960
person isn't even usually growing them

2580
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,119
out anymore

2581
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,158
yeah

2582
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:34,158
you know

2583
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:35,119
so i i will say just just to finish the

2584
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:37,279
story

2585
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:38,960
i will give skunk tech some major props

2586
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:40,800
he didn't even have to tell me that he

2587
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,800
had those he didn't have to tell me that

2588
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,800
he did selections and

2589
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,039
made more and he certainly didn't have

2590
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,480
to tell natso to make sure i get them

2591
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:50,560
you know or make sure i know about them

2592
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:52,399
to get them so props to him for doing

2593
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,520
that i was i was that was pretty [ __ ]

2594
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:57,119
cool and uh there are

2595
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:59,040
ak-47f2 somewhere and they're uh based

2596
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:00,479
on the cherry stuff so that's cool too

2597
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:02,880
what's sad about it

2598
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:06,000
is that in 1999

2599
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:08,480
um they changed the laws in holland in

2600
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,079
amsterdam and um i should say the

2601
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:11,359
netherlands really because only two

2602
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:12,880
provinces

2603
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:15,359
uh are uh

2604
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,520
are our holland but in the netherlands

2605
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:19,359
they changed the seed laws where before

2606
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,840
seed making was legal

2607
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:24,960
and they changed it to being illegal and

2608
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,880
most of the big producers in in the

2609
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,279
netherlands got busted within a year or

2610
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,279
two of that change yeah

2611
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:33,039
and a lot of seed strains and a lot of

2612
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:34,238
lines that were available throughout the

2613
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,960
90s

2614
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:39,599
then changed because parents were lost

2615
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,520
yes being dutch

2616
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,440
and i'm not trying to be

2617
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,040
racist is the wrong word or whatever but

2618
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:46,960
just culturally

2619
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:49,840
the dutch are businessmen and they won't

2620
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,800
admit that they lost anything ever

2621
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,880
yeah

2622
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,239
so if you ask ben or alan drunkers

2623
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,679
they'll tell you they have all the same

2624
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:58,158
breeding parents that they've had since

2625
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:00,880
the 90s yeah but we know that's not the

2626
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:02,399
case and it apparently simon admitted

2627
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,600
that he lost a couple of breeding

2628
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:07,279
parents

2629
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:09,679
in in his raid and coli mist and ak-47

2630
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:11,198
were not the same after

2631
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:13,199
yeah

2632
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:14,960
we should also it should also be said

2633
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:16,399
and this is super [ __ ] annoying for

2634
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,840
me right

2635
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:19,679
but that

2636
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,840
neville and

2637
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,719
s super sativa seed club kind of came

2638
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,600
first

2639
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,359
right

2640
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,719
so they just told you where they were

2641
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:29,039
what they were doing

2642
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:31,439
yeah they didn't have competition right

2643
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:32,960
so neville was like oh i got this nl

2644
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:34,638
from this person and i got this from

2645
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,880
this this and i crossed them and i

2646
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:40,000
called it nl by this

2647
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:42,480
yeah right and and he gave you a whole

2648
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,840
bunch of information on lineage

2649
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:45,439
yeah and we can go through we've done it

2650
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,679
before but you can go through and most

2651
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:49,279
of where neville got his stuff we know

2652
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:51,760
the name of the person that gave it to

2653
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:54,238
him we know where he got it we know if

2654
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,520
he got it as a seed line or if he got it

2655
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:58,319
as a cutting

2656
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,239
right yep we know all that [ __ ]

2657
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:02,479
i like simon and simon was really nice

2658
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:05,279
to me right but

2659
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:07,279
i don't [ __ ] know it's an ak-47

2660
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:10,079
yeah i don't know exactly what's in

2661
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:12,960
collie mist i've been hunting for 25 30

2662
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:15,920
years what the lineage on that stuff is

2663
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:19,198
yeah and all the second wave of breeders

2664
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:22,158
uh that came out uh sag martha syria

2665
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:23,198
seeds th seeds dutch passion all you

2666
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:26,719
know uh

2667
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:29,359
um what's his name um luke from paradise

2668
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:31,600
yes what's in scentsy star

2669
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:33,119
god only knows what's in what they all

2670
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,199
started hiding it

2671
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:37,760
yeah they they hid where they got it

2672
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:38,719
from who they got it from what the mix

2673
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,800
was in

2674
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:44,480
right and so it started this massive

2675
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:47,520
guessing game of i love ak-47

2676
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:49,279
yeah i have no idea what's in it

2677
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,679
i would love for simon to one day be

2678
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:54,000
like i'm old and i'm just down to

2679
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:55,760
say it you know what i one thing i will

2680
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,760
say that's also interesting is from that

2681
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,679
old pack of seeds and i believe they

2682
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,280
were sold and simon said according to

2683
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:03,039
the number on it they were sold in 2000

2684
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:05,359
which meant they could have been made in

2685
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:08,000
98.99

2686
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:10,238
what was interesting was that the cherry

2687
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,039
pheno was supposedly popping up what do

2688
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:15,839
you say one in 500 or 100 000 something

2689
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:18,639
a lot it took a lot to find it

2690
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:21,600
in the three seeds that popped

2691
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:23,679
out of 10 from this old pack

2692
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,600
two were cherry

2693
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,760
so i wonder if there's some sort of like

2694
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,360
viking in it um which was a very cherry

2695
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,760
line floating around amsterdam at the

2696
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:33,519
time that a lot of people are using um

2697
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,360
but that's the first thing that that

2698
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,120
makes me think that and i think that's

2699
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:39,359
pretty interesting it could you're you

2700
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:41,119
know let me just said that that uh

2701
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:42,960
something that i didn't know that it

2702
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:44,639
wasn't lost in the bus that simon's

2703
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,158
ex-wife killed them killed a couple

2704
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,560
plants out of spite

2705
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:50,638
oh wait it was it was it's common

2706
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,120
knowledge that he lost him and i mean i

2707
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,840
always heard that he lost him yeah um

2708
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:55,679
but

2709
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,760
you know i assumed it was in the bust

2710
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:59,520
and he admitted that he lost one parent

2711
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,400
but he never admitted that he lost more

2712
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,840
than that

2713
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:02,879
yeah but he would just never give up the

2714
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,760
mix

2715
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,199
yeah

2716
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,639
he just never

2717
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:09,198
that that's another thing that also

2718
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:11,359
really confused me is that

2719
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:13,839
i don't understand why

2720
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:15,279
they would i granted a lot of them were

2721
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,039
trying to steal each other's clones and

2722
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:18,319
steal each other's seeds or whatever but

2723
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:20,719
if they were breeders they would know

2724
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:22,639
that how expressions in cannabis work

2725
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,399
you know so they probably like i would

2726
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:26,639
think that they wouldn't be focused too

2727
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:28,960
much on well we can't tell them the name

2728
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,319
or the the line that this came from

2729
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,880
because they'll get the same thing and i

2730
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:35,119
mean well no one knows and you're aware

2731
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,400
uh neville's opinion was they stole most

2732
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:37,760
of it from him and didn't want to give

2733
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,119
him [ __ ] credit

2734
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,039
yeah i know yeah he thought everything

2735
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,559
was his though no matter what i know i'm

2736
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:43,359
not saying it is i'm not saying it's

2737
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,280
true

2738
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:49,439
yeah but for whatever reason

2739
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:52,319
um you know like yeah what's in chronic

2740
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:55,359
what's what's what's kali missed

2741
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:56,719
what's synchronic what's what's ak-47

2742
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:58,319
what are the parents

2743
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,840
yeah where do you get the parents who

2744
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:01,599
gave them the parents

2745
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:04,480
yeah you know

2746
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,600
um all that right you just don't know

2747
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:06,718
yeah you know they've never come out and

2748
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,000
said and those things came out in the

2749
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:10,480
mid 90s

2750
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,880
yeah so we're talking 25 years plus of

2751
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:14,959
him being secretive yeah

2752
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:16,239
you know and yeah neville had an ego and

2753
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,760
he thought the whole [ __ ] scene was

2754
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:19,919
based on his [ __ ]

2755
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,840
yeah and some of it was but some of it

2756
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,440
was his ego you know i still think he

2757
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,840
renamed afghani one

2758
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:26,879
i mean i know you do yeah i'm always i'm

2759
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,800
always going to push that theory and

2760
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,319
it's based on nothing but i'm still

2761
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,320
going to push it just because i can i

2762
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:34,799
mean one of the things that i learned

2763
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:36,319
about uh

2764
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,520
someone just asked what i believe in

2765
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:39,759
collie missed

2766
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,120
um i was told by some guys in amsterdam

2767
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,960
that um

2768
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:45,039
you know that the mother plant was this

2769
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,719
thing called the mango

2770
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:48,319
and it was made by this guy that i don't

2771
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:50,480
want to name his name or whatever but it

2772
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:52,719
was he was the guy that came up with it

2773
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:55,599
and that was at least half of it

2774
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,560
um and i i see people uh

2775
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,239
uh

2776
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,400
you know there's people want to talk

2777
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:02,238
about whatever but i mean the thing is

2778
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:03,359
is that when i went over there and when

2779
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,759
i started going over there in the mid

2780
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,439
90s there was already a bunch of dudes

2781
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,719
that were middle-aged that all had beef

2782
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,359
with one another

2783
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:12,960
yeah and obviously neville and sam had a

2784
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,439
bunch of beef with one another and they

2785
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,679
sniped at each other for years

2786
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:19,198
um and so there's an aspect there's an

2787
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,480
aspect too where it's like sometimes

2788
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:21,759
people just didn't want to give other

2789
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:23,599
people credit

2790
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,800
yeah they didn't want it to come from

2791
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,800
them

2792
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,400
yeah you know they didn't want it to be

2793
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,000
that way they didn't want it they didn't

2794
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:31,119
want to be like oh well i got that from

2795
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,679
homie

2796
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:35,840
yeah because homie was a dick to them

2797
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:37,920
in their mind you know and then they had

2798
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,760
beef and so then there was politics you

2799
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,679
can look at the politics of 90s

2800
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,239
amsterdam and you can fast forward 30

2801
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:45,039
years and it goes on today in california

2802
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:46,638
yeah

2803
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:48,960
it's very common

2804
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:51,520
so this is this is one of the

2805
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,279
old pictures of afghani one that has a

2806
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,600
lot of similar traits to what you will

2807
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:57,920
see in in things like super skunk or

2808
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:59,920
even chem 91 and that's one of the the

2809
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,840
things that originally put me on to that

2810
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,760
and seeing and the la athey cut that we

2811
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:06,560
had that was a afghani number one

2812
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:08,719
selection homie just said uh cali mist

2813
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,880
was originally called western winds

2814
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,239
western winds was one of my favorite

2815
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,440
all-time

2816
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,000
uh

2817
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:17,198
cannabis names cambodian cambodian

2818
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,439
that's what they said but i don't

2819
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:21,919
[ __ ] know it's supposedly when they

2820
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:23,119
were at cerebral together it was the

2821
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,760
same thing

2822
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:27,760
and they broke off tony called his

2823
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,639
version western winds

2824
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,960
and simon called his kali mist but they

2825
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:34,480
were the same thing yeah they were the

2826
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,560
or they i mean maybe they maybe they

2827
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:38,559
made different breeding selections or

2828
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:41,199
choices but they were the same

2829
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:43,920
the same origin for the most part i will

2830
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:45,519
say tony tony has been ridiculously

2831
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,279
transparent and open with me when it

2832
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,239
comes to asking any questions he's the

2833
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:50,238
only

2834
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:53,119
dutch dude who who had a seed bank from

2835
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:54,399
back then that never like flinches when

2836
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:56,479
i ask him something he's always been

2837
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:58,079
super open even if it's not like

2838
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:59,678
even if he doesn't know the answer he'll

2839
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:01,920
tell you well i don't really know this

2840
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:03,840
game i bought it in bulk from xyz and

2841
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,600
that's what it is and that's all we know

2842
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,000
he's been really [ __ ] cool about it

2843
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,159
so i got to give props to him for that

2844
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,158
you know i mean maybe maybe he would say

2845
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:13,920
what it was but maybe if it came from

2846
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:15,439
simon or he had b for some guy he didn't

2847
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,119
like he wouldn't say it

2848
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:18,319
yeah because that goes on today like

2849
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:20,000
people don't want to give other people

2850
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:21,359
credit if they don't like the person you

2851
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,760
know or they feel like they got jacked

2852
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:24,719
on a i mean even like somebody like sam

2853
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,280
like

2854
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:29,279
if it wasn't for mel frank i don't you

2855
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:31,439
know talking about it years later you

2856
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:33,759
wouldn't know that afghani won and

2857
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:36,000
durbin poison came through mel frank

2858
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:38,159
yeah and he gave him to sam

2859
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,279
yeah you know sam showed up in amsterdam

2860
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:41,599
with him

2861
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:44,238
you know yeah

2862
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,400
and uh you know and then you know tony

2863
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:47,678
tony has you know and then once a line

2864
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:49,198
splits

2865
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:50,560
maybe different breeders make different

2866
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:52,719
selections

2867
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:56,000
yeah they lean it towards one direction

2868
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:57,679
or another you know they lose adam and

2869
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,760
the bubble gum and like the different

2870
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:02,000
ways simon worked bubble gum supposedly

2871
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,159
and all that yeah i mean i know that i

2872
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,719
know i you know i didn't i didn't know

2873
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:08,879
until tonight that that uh simon's ex or

2874
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:11,279
whatever killed killed the cut but

2875
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,119
simon's cauli mist in the 90s was much

2876
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:16,399
more sativa-leaning

2877
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:18,238
and then around 99 2000 it got shorter

2878
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:20,399
and thicker and more

2879
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:22,479
more indica more afghan

2880
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:24,879
and it lost some of the ethereal

2881
01:36:22,479 --> 01:36:26,319
qualities that i liked a bunch about it

2882
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,079
you know that's one that i'd really like

2883
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:30,238
to reproduce and we have the old seats

2884
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:32,399
to do it but i just it's one of those

2885
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:34,319
ones that like i'd spend

2886
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:36,399
money and time reproducing it and they

2887
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:37,759
would just sit there you know and nobody

2888
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:39,519
grew up because cali missed really isn't

2889
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:42,239
one that people talk about at you know

2890
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:44,639
the average fur still in the u.s it's

2891
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:46,638
phenomenal there's phenos in western

2892
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:48,639
winds and you can look

2893
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:51,359
in western winds and cauli mist

2894
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:53,840
especially in like some mid to late 90s

2895
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:55,679
high times cannabis cups like the glossy

2896
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,960
pictures they would have and those and

2897
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:59,199
those things

2898
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:02,399
um and uh

2899
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:04,638
you know and um you know so

2900
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:07,839
they uh they're those are really nice

2901
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:08,960
you know yeah and um

2902
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,639
you know

2903
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,239
you know then he comes out and says it's

2904
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:14,239
kind of true i don't mean that like sam

2905
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:15,759
took a bunch of credit for it i just

2906
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:18,319
mean that it was like in the list of

2907
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,880
stuff that that mel that you know that

2908
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:23,118
he brought to amsterdam yeah and he

2909
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,639
didn't obviously say well i got these

2910
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:26,079
two things from these guys and i got

2911
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,760
these from these guys and here's the

2912
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:29,679
three haze brothers names that i got

2913
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,600
these seats like you know it was sketchy

2914
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:33,199
back then yes you still can't get that

2915
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,719
[ __ ] out of him

2916
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:36,479
you still can't get that out of him all

2917
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,480
i'll tell me is that i'm wrong about the

2918
01:37:36,479 --> 01:37:40,718
a story tell me what

2919
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:42,559
one day you know one day

2920
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,480
i mean it's uh one thing about weed is

2921
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,159
that people are opinionated

2922
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:48,559
yes and it takes a certain kind of

2923
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:50,238
person to take the risks that we all we

2924
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,600
all take and the various things that go

2925
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:55,279
on and you know we get beef you know and

2926
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,920
all that stuff and so

2927
01:37:55,279 --> 01:38:00,319
um but it's it's also true that a lot of

2928
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,480
weed is a flash in the pan

2929
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:04,399
so it might be around for two or three

2930
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:05,759
or four years five years and then all of

2931
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:07,439
a sudden it's gone or it's not there in

2932
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,440
the same it's not there in the same in

2933
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:10,799
the same category anymore yeah it

2934
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:12,719
doesn't exist

2935
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,560
um and there's some there's some really

2936
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,439
good versions of ak that still float

2937
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,199
around um there was an ak in colorado

2938
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:21,599
that our good buddy working men and i

2939
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:24,638
talk about all the time that was a huge

2940
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:27,679
yielding beast of a sativa um and it

2941
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:30,480
smelled exactly like sandalwood did

2942
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:32,319
pure sandalwood terps uh matt worked

2943
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:33,678
with an ak version that had strong

2944
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:35,920
cherry liqueur

2945
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,199
cherry and then lemon i had a lemon one

2946
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,600
too that was awesome and then i had the

2947
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:42,000
rc colafino that used to go around skunk

2948
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,639
magazine and it smelled like flat cola

2949
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,960
it was it was pretty uncanny so that

2950
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:49,760
that's a pretty wide terp range in the

2951
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,840
ak line and and interesting and unique

2952
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:54,159
terps and a lot of them had some pretty

2953
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,119
god some pretty good highs with them too

2954
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:57,599
you know

2955
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:59,118
so that was a really simon didn't have a

2956
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:01,280
lot of strains

2957
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:02,719
but you know the only the only strain

2958
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:04,559
that i think he had there was absolute

2959
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,079
bunk and i apologize if you hear this

2960
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,000
simon is chronic

2961
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:11,118
yeah i grew out a bunch of chronic and

2962
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,198
it was big and midsy and ugly

2963
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:14,000
and i never found anything worthwhile in

2964
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,238
it but

2965
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,479
his bubble gum and his ak and his white

2966
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:20,238
russian and his cali mist and all that

2967
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:21,759
that was all real nice weed

2968
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:23,519
i think white russian is totally

2969
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,679
underrated too from all white russian is

2970
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,400
a super underrated strain and it was one

2971
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:30,239
of his standards for a long time and it

2972
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:32,079
was killer weed yeah there was some

2973
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:34,479
really nice phenos of it

2974
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:36,639
you know i wish i knew i wish just for

2975
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:39,439
my weed nerdism or whatever i wish i

2976
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:40,400
knew i you know i wish i knew what ak-47

2977
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:42,638
was

2978
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:44,000
yeah like what is it

2979
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:46,079
i think if we're getting these cherry

2980
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,479
liqueur phenotypes is from hexabutyrate

2981
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:50,079
not a terp but do you think that i mean

2982
01:39:48,479 --> 01:39:52,399
because we know that during that time

2983
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:54,639
there was one real strong cherry kicker

2984
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:55,599
that was being used in amsterdam

2985
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:57,520
um

2986
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,360
which was the either the holland's hope

2987
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,800
which was a version of the viking or

2988
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:04,158
just using viking and they were being

2989
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:06,960
used widely at that time so i i

2990
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:08,399
i've never

2991
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,000
now that i know that it's just like and

2992
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,079
how how commonly it occurs it almost

2993
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,399
seems like it would have to be

2994
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:17,920
chimera and crybaby both telling us that

2995
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:20,158
the cherry is is is uh from uh

2996
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:22,319
it's not a terp you know yeah that's why

2997
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:23,839
you know it's it's the theol's and all

2998
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:26,158
all the various esters and all the

2999
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,239
various things that lead to aromas

3000
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:30,879
uh that's not an aldehyde that's not

3001
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:32,238
that's not nice uh forte necessarily

3002
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,000
there's a lot of learning that i could

3003
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:35,118
do over there that would expand my

3004
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,039
knowledge

3005
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:38,559
um but

3006
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:39,439
i would love if he told me what was in

3007
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,480
it

3008
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:41,759
yeah

3009
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:43,118
it would be real it would be really neat

3010
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,880
just to know because it's one of the

3011
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:47,359
all-time great strains

3012
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,840
yeah the super cool strain and it's neat

3013
01:40:47,359 --> 01:40:52,319
that there's

3014
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:53,840
um it's neat that there is uh

3015
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:55,759
maybe here's something that we've talked

3016
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,920
about and that most people don't don't

3017
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,280
think about too much but um we're

3018
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,399
getting close to the end but i'll throw

3019
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:01,840
it out there

3020
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:03,839
yeah and maybe this is something that

3021
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,880
like a chimera could chime in on or

3022
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,800
whatever but

3023
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:09,359
um what would happen let's say you have

3024
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,760
two ak-47s

3025
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,759
or you know or two nl5 hazes or

3026
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,440
something like that from the 90s and

3027
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:17,440
you're pretty damn sure that they are

3028
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:18,479
what they are that they're the exact

3029
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:20,399
same

3030
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:22,000
era they're the exact same parents

3031
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:24,000
they're just two different

3032
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,359
two different plants but from the same

3033
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,039
seed line yeah if you reverse one on to

3034
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:30,839
the other

3035
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:33,920
do you get a feminized

3036
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:36,319
seedline because it's not an outcross

3037
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,800
and it's not an s1

3038
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:40,238
so so give me the situation again

3039
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,119
let's say you took

3040
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:43,198
uh

3041
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:46,559
you know um

3042
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:49,439
a a cherry ak and crossed it to the

3043
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:51,840
colorado sandalwood ak okay

3044
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:53,839
it's not an s1

3045
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,960
and it's not an outcross

3046
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,760
no

3047
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,279
right

3048
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:59,119
that's when we make up words like in

3049
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:00,800
cross that's when we make them up

3050
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:03,599
because cannabis is very unique and we

3051
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,639
got to make up our own [ __ ] words

3052
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,960
you can do it with anything you could

3053
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:08,079
take any any anything that you know are

3054
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:11,198
sisters

3055
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:12,559
yeah and that came from the same parents

3056
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:13,879
right because most people that are doing

3057
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,639
reversals

3058
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:19,199
99.99 percent of reversals are either s

3059
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:21,039
ones or out crosses

3060
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:23,198
yeah we would i mean i know me and caleb

3061
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:24,639
refer to them as f2rs just when we talk

3062
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:26,319
so we know what we're talking about but

3063
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,159
i don't think there's any standard term

3064
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:29,759
because there's a way where it's like

3065
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:32,479
you know part of the reason why we do

3066
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,800
s1s uh one of the reasons why we do it

3067
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:37,118
in cannabis at least is because often

3068
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:39,520
there's only one pheno there's only one

3069
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:40,719
living cut of a certain line left and in

3070
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,480
order for you to look within the

3071
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:44,319
genetics of the line and see what else

3072
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:45,678
might be in there you have to cross it

3073
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:48,319
to itself

3074
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:51,440
yeah we would make normal lines out of a

3075
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:53,840
lot of these strains had we a male

3076
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:55,118
yes or had we but if you have two

3077
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:56,880
females

3078
01:42:55,118 --> 01:42:58,399
and you're sure they're the exact same

3079
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:00,159
thing

3080
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:01,279
right then you could breed two sisters

3081
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:03,039
together

3082
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:04,479
yeah and it wouldn't be inbreeding as

3083
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:06,800
much because they would have two

3084
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:09,359
different genetic profiles

3085
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,360
yes right it's not you're not in you're

3086
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:13,439
not inbreeding to the extent that an s1

3087
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:16,639
would be no no you're not you're not

3088
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:19,559
isolating traits still so you take you

3089
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:22,840
take a sandalwood smelling

3090
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:25,119
ak-47 and you cross it onto the cherry

3091
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,560
ak-47 yeah

3092
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:29,279
and you you know and then you have you

3093
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,760
have a you have a feminized seed line

3094
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:34,479
maybe that's what uh bitter did with the

3095
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:36,719
p91 s ones took two different p91s ones

3096
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:38,479
and crossed them together to create his

3097
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,880
neck but the difference is that those

3098
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:43,839
are two s ones crossed together

3099
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:47,359
yeah i'm talking about like two sisters

3100
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,360
from the same exact hybrid

3101
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:51,439
you see them same thing

3102
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:53,039
that's what i was though two sisters

3103
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:54,638
from the same because if you have an s1

3104
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:57,600
if you have two sisters from an s1

3105
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:57,600
there's one parent

3106
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:02,158
and that's one has one parent right

3107
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:05,279
there's two identical parents so the

3108
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:06,960
genetics is essentially one parent

3109
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,439
but if you take two sisters from a

3110
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,399
regular line

3111
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:12,799
right

3112
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:13,679
yeah then it's two parents

3113
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,039
you know

3114
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:16,319
and it's like if you like for instance i

3115
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:17,679
got multiple daughters you look at my

3116
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:18,880
daughters they're not two peas from the

3117
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:20,719
same pod

3118
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,920
yeah obviously you know they have some

3119
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:23,279
they got you know they look very

3120
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:25,279
different from each other

3121
01:44:23,279 --> 01:44:27,840
yeah you know my wife and i's genes

3122
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:30,719
popped in different ways in that regard

3123
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:33,199
so you're referring specifically to an

3124
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,399
f1 hybrid and then using

3125
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:36,479
two

3126
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:39,118
sisters from that f1 hybrid not from a

3127
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,799
reversal necessarily like let's say for

3128
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:42,960
instance you took

3129
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:46,560
um you know we can't get we can't

3130
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:48,639
guarantee this but let's say you took c5

3131
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,480
and crossed it to cuban black and you

3132
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:52,800
were sure you know that you're or you

3133
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:55,439
had two phenos of nl5 haze

3134
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,279
yeah and you knew that the mom was nl5

3135
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:59,678
and the dad was haze in both it was just

3136
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:02,079
two phenols from the same thing

3137
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:03,840
right and you cross those you reversed

3138
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:05,359
one on to the other

3139
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,679
yeah that's probably one of the most

3140
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:09,359
rare things in breeding

3141
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:12,079
because then you'd have a feminized line

3142
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:13,679
but it wouldn't be an s1

3143
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:15,439
i mean the only difference between that

3144
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:18,880
and the feminized version would be that

3145
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:20,479
the feminized version would have less

3146
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:23,520
variation

3147
01:45:20,479 --> 01:45:25,198
because there wasn't an additional

3148
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,719
uh line

3149
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:28,079
at the

3150
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:29,439
what we're calling the parental level

3151
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:31,439
but that's what i just mean in the sense

3152
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:33,678
that so let's say you take let's say you

3153
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:35,759
make a cherry ak s1

3154
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:38,399
yeah you're gonna only have the gene

3155
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:40,560
pool that's within that specific

3156
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,079
that specific plant

3157
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,880
it would be going in that direction for

3158
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:46,719
that specific but if you had if you had

3159
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,400
a sister of hers

3160
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:50,719
yes that was totally different even

3161
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:52,879
though they're sisters she probably has

3162
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:53,920
a different a slightly different genetic

3163
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:56,159
makeup

3164
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,079
so it would be a sibling cross

3165
01:45:56,158 --> 01:46:00,238
yeah but it's almost never done because

3166
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:02,399
we almost never have to it wouldn't be

3167
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:04,158
nearly as inbred

3168
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:05,839
yeah it wouldn't be nearly as inbred as

3169
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:08,479
a reverse crop and you'd probably you'd

3170
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:10,800
probably get like a a lot wider

3171
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:12,000
expression within the seats

3172
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,079
you know what's interesting though what

3173
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,719
you're describing is almost exactly what

3174
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,760
dj did with blueberry

3175
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:20,639
two

3176
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,880
things that were were from the same

3177
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:25,520
parentage two totally opposite different

3178
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:27,440
expressions and constantly re-cross them

3179
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,280
from a small population

3180
01:46:27,439 --> 01:46:30,799
each generation i mean i'm not saying

3181
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:32,399
that like in a perfect world if you had

3182
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,639
hundreds of seeds that's the direction

3183
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:37,118
that you you should go in oh no no but

3184
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:38,480
i'm just saying that is a method sure

3185
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:40,960
there's there's an aspect where it's

3186
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:43,439
like if all you have in the line is one

3187
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:46,639
living living example

3188
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:49,359
then you all you can do is self it

3189
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:51,118
yeah but if you got two

3190
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:52,238
then you could widen the gene pool just

3191
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:54,639
slightly

3192
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:57,439
yeah and have and have a group of seeds

3193
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:59,600
that had a slightly wider gene pool

3194
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:02,559
than you could get with s1

3195
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,280
yeah but i think like if you keep like

3196
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,920
that

3197
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:08,319
he did it with moonbow 99 and mumbo 112

3198
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,319
yeah i think if you do that and you keep

3199
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:11,759
doing it in successive generations what

3200
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:15,599
you get is a lot of mutants and

3201
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:18,000
weirdness without necessarily the the

3202
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:20,880
narrow down variation i was just

3203
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,639
thinking in terms of like 90s weed or

3204
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,319
various things where you might get lucky

3205
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:26,480
and you might have one or you might have

3206
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:27,759
two or even three phenos that might

3207
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:28,638
exist

3208
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,560
yeah

3209
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,800
you see

3210
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,239
yeah like where it wouldn't be that that

3211
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:35,199
would probably be

3212
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:36,559
i don't know

3213
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:38,719
you know it's just something that's not

3214
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:40,719
often done but if there's two females

3215
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:42,239
from the same line you might be able to

3216
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:45,198
figure it out

3217
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:46,718
but it's almost never done

3218
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:49,279
think of somebody that think of somebody

3219
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:51,359
that has that often

3220
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:54,399
it's like it's almost like that crossing

3221
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:56,079
it's not don't you don't see back

3222
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:57,279
you don't see back crosses to males

3223
01:47:56,079 --> 01:47:59,118
often done

3224
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:01,679
but it's an interesting thing you know

3225
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:04,238
what i mean it has its place

3226
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:06,079
yeah i just in terms of i mean in terms

3227
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:07,439
of most genetic preservation we're like

3228
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:10,479
super lucky

3229
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:12,238
if one pheno of an old line survives

3230
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:14,238
oh yeah for sure

3231
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:16,638
you know but in the case of in the case

3232
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:18,079
of nl5 by hazy

3233
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,600
there's probably three or four or five

3234
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:21,840
that survived

3235
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:23,360
yeah a lot more than that i think if we

3236
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,480
really knew for sure i think there'd be

3237
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:25,920
a lot more

3238
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:28,079
you know and so there's potential where

3239
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,079
you could you could you know you could i

3240
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:31,840
don't know i mean it's just interesting

3241
01:48:30,079 --> 01:48:33,359
in that in that regard right yeah

3242
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,400
projects the monster those are not

3243
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:37,198
siblings

3244
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:38,879
um we don't know for sure

3245
01:48:37,198 --> 01:48:39,919
they're not [ __ ] siblings i don't

3246
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,560
think so

3247
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:44,880
yeah but we once apparently hoped that

3248
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,320
we hoped that that philos and some other

3249
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,159
and some other genetic groups would be

3250
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:51,279
able to prove these things

3251
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:53,519
and it has not happened

3252
01:48:51,279 --> 01:48:54,960
yeah no phyllos got everybody's money

3253
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,719
because they promised they would be able

3254
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,239
to show what was a grandparent what was

3255
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:01,118
a child what was a hut what was a

3256
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:02,319
daughter what was a mother and not not

3257
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:03,839
the case

3258
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:06,000
and we're still going to do a full

3259
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,880
episode on that eventually

3260
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,319
um

3261
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,079
on why

3262
01:49:08,319 --> 01:49:11,679
why we were able to prove that it was a

3263
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:16,079
broken system

3264
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:17,199
uh effectively prove it but um yeah

3265
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:19,279
you're gonna give it a little bit of

3266
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:22,000
time so people don't get to butt hurt

3267
01:49:19,279 --> 01:49:23,759
and sue and all that [ __ ]

3268
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,158
you know but it's it's just one of those

3269
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:28,079
things where uh

3270
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:30,158
between no whether males or females are

3271
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:31,760
responsible specific

3272
01:49:30,158 --> 01:49:35,198
there's no there's no you know there's a

3273
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:37,360
lot of there's no way it works

3274
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:39,678
because because cannabis for a long time

3275
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:39,679
has been

3276
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,840
well i just i was just gonna say that um

3277
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,319
cannabis for a long time has been

3278
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:49,440
deprived of science or the science

3279
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:52,719
aspect

3280
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:54,638
of uh of breeding uh most of it is

3281
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:56,960
observational by people

3282
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:58,719
still to this day there are some people

3283
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:01,039
that um

3284
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:03,279
uh there are some people that are doing

3285
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:05,359
that are doing work uh that are using a

3286
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:07,118
lot more uh scientific methods and

3287
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:09,198
things like that but

3288
01:50:07,118 --> 01:50:11,039
um it's rare still

3289
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:12,799
yeah most cannabis breeding is

3290
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:15,118
observational

3291
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,400
um and so it's hard to know males and

3292
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:18,559
females

3293
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:20,960
um you know we just don't have we just

3294
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,239
we just we're not up until 10 15 years

3295
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:25,198
ago or something like that we were

3296
01:50:22,238 --> 01:50:26,799
mostly denied labs yeah we were mostly

3297
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:29,439
denied access

3298
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:32,960
um to what you know normal breeders

3299
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:32,960
would be able to use all the time

3300
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:37,519
yeah so i want to do a um giveaway

3301
