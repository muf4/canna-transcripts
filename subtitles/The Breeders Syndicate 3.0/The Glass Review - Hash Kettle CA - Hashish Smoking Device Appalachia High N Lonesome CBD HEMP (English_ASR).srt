and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,439
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,199
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,278
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,600
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,960
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,518
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,519
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,120
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,359
of

16
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:39,039
cookies we are the traditional Market

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,600
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,479
makers that want to push back against

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,120
all the smok and mirrors in doing so we

20
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,238
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,839
those who oppose and my personal mission

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,358
has become much bigger than myself

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,719
welcome to the Cannabis underground this

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,719
is the

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,480
revolution hey everyone welcome to Breer

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,120
Syndicate um today we're going to be

27
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,358
doing review news and today I'm going to

28
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,319
review the hash Kettle now most of the

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,960
time when we review Glass on here it's

30
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,879
almost always C2 because well they're my

31
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,399
homies and it's my favorite glass on

32
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,478
Earth however I've been seeing like this

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,159
hash Kettle thing online and like I've

34
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,879
always said we don't do sponsored

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,719
reviews right we never do sponsored

36
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,719
reviews so out of our own money we went

37
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,759
and bought this beautiful it's actually

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:31,039
stunning as a just a showpiece a

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,599
beautiful yellow fumed it's hard to see

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,360
uh in this video but it's yellow fumed

41
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,078
glass and it has a pink inside thing

42
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:43,599
where you put the snake a nice top that

43
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:45,919
goes on keeps the hash in oops and uh

44
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,879
yeah the that's a little pink

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,680
top and I don't know if you can see it

46
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,679
I'll try to put it on

47
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:58,679
here you can't wait see there's a stamp

48
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:02,478
it says hash corporation

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,960
Canada and um hasco I think it says or

50
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,319
something like that

51
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:10,719
anyway um yeah so I'll be reviewing this

52
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,318
paid for it not sponsored wholehearted

53
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:18,199
review now the one thing I learned with

54
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:21,039
these do not use like sift dry sift that

55
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,639
you've really like really clean dry sift

56
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,479
that you've pressed into hash so first

57
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:30,399
you have to make a hash snake so we've

58
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:33,000
done this um I have some really nice

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
from high and Lonesome of Appalachia

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,639
which that's kind of one of the perks of

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,120
this [ __ ] right like I get to have

62
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,919
people like high and Lonesome s is own

63
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,680
an Appalachia hat killer to try so but

64
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,079
the the requirement is is that it's

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,959
hashish with a lot of a very unclean

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,000
hashish it has to be or it won't burn in

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,239
the snake properly it'll just melt won't

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,680
smoke in the thing it's a mess when it's

69
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,800
too pure and I already tried that once

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,400
so this time we are going to try to

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,560
attempt it with a little bit less clean

72
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,039
of a sift and see how this thing smokes

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,239
and you guys are going to see it for the

74
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,039
first time with you so first test to see

75
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,920
if it's clean enough to smoke is

76
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,199
lighting the snake and this is part of

77
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,559
the process of the hash Kettle so get

78
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:18,399
the snake and you light

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
it I think that's what we

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,680
do there we go now it's lit hey it's

81
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:31,438
going put snake in here like

82
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,280
so as you can see the snake is in here

83
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,280
lit put on the lid here we

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:57,040
go yeah it's actually one of the nicest

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,519
hash smoking tools I've ever

86
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,519
had um don't have to put it on top of a

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,480
b with other weed to enjoy it this is a

88
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,158
straight up hash experience this is so

89
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,919
cool like how it's actually functioning

90
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,560
super Smokey in there see if I clear it

91
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,559
out hold

92
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:20,199
on there we go so there we go so you see

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,560
the hash snake burning on its own it's

94
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,879
got oxygen now you know a little oxygen

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,000
coming in here just enough to keep it

96
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,159
burning you put the lid on it it catches

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,439
it see how the Smoke's just going

98
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,439
downwards now towards oxygen coming

99
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,360
out I'm going sit here and pop this

100
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,359
whole damn

101
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,360
thing I'll probably have to edit that's

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
really boring just watching me sit and

103
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,600
smoke this whole [ __ ] thing but it's

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,038
pretty good I'm digging

105
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,800
it now let me see what the price on

106
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,879
these is let's see hash Kettle Canada

107
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,478
hash

108
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:03,639
Kettle can doing this all with one hand

109
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,038
yeah you can get massive hits off this

110
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,639
this is [ __ ]

111
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,879
great so for

112
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:14,199
140 9.95 which is actually a really

113
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,199
great price you can get the Hash

114
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:27,000
k yeah this is uh pretty pretty awesome

115
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,840
pretty Faboo I must

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,399
say um I think I paid a little more for

117
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,318
this one just because of the yellow

118
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,679
fumed part but like I haven't wanted to

119
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,960
use it too because it's just so

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,120
beautiful and I'm going to have to clean

121
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,120
it I don't want to get it

122
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,919
dirty I actually keep it in my display

123
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,600
cabinet because it's so pretty next to

124
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,120
the uh Clockwork Orange um dab rig which

125
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,879
I guess I've got to [ __ ] show off

126
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,240
some point I hate using my pretty glass

127
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:01,079
it's super expensive every time I mess

128
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,600
with it I'm scared I'm going to break it

129
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,639
but like this is pretty amazing the

130
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,000
snake keeps smoking you know I can sit

131
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,680
here and talk shoot the [ __ ] smoke as I

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,680
please doesn't burn up too

133
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:24,319
fast beautiful appy

has this is this is rather nice this is

135
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,199
great so again hash Kettle Canada hash

136
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:34,000
Co the hash Kettle and like I said

137
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
this's got a pink top pink inner side

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,720
yellow fuming so they do make it like

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,918
that um not all of them are like that

140
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,840
it's special editions that are released

141
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,240

142

like you know this is a winner and I

164
