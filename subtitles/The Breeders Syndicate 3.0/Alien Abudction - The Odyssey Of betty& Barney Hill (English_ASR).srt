this is captured preventing barn hill

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,560
ufo experience

26
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,759
many people have asked me why i decided

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,478
to

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,759
research and investigate my aunt and

29
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,920
uncle's ufo sighting and why i decided

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,879
to write a book about it

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
when

32
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,319
other books had been written about it

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,639
the interrupted journey primarily but

34
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,879
there had been it had been mentioned in

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,519
other books and my reply to that is

36
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,319
in 1988

37
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,478
i watched a television series

38
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,798
called cosmos

39
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,599
carl sagan was on it

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,280
and carl presented the story of the

41
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,438
betting barney hill

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,718
ufo experience

43
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,879
and

44
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,919
it showed betty and barney

45
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,879
riding down the highway very very dark

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,439
night

47
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,239
torrential downpours the windshield

48
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,919
wipers were swishing back and forth the

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
radio was on

50
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,639
there was a lot of static and betty was

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,400
turning the knob as she was nervously

52
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,279
looking up at the sky

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,280
and barney was saying don't worry betty

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,878
it's only a plane or a satellite or

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,759
something

56
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,840
and

57
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,560
all of that

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
was false

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
if

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
i

61
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,080
actually contacted steve markle who is

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,319
the chief meteorologist at the mount

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
washington weather station in new

64
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,839
hampshire

65
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,000
and i asked him to look into his

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,920
archival records

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
i wanted to know exactly what the

68
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:56,719
weather conditions were that night

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,039
so i did all of the research from myself

70
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,359
although other researchers had done and

71
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,560
i didn't want to believe anything anyone

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
said

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,920
well steve markle told me

74
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:11,039
that it was a light bright night

75
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,639
atop the the rock is what he called

76
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,199
mount washington

77
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,479
and the visibility was 130 miles

78
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,518
there were high

79
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,000
cirrus clouds covering about 60 percent

80
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,879
of the sky but they were the type of

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,360
clouds that you can see through

82
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,679
so you could see the stars through

83
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
there was a waxing gibbous moon it would

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,280
be full in six days

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,239
so it was not raining

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,400
there was not an inversion a temperature

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,360
inversion that night that would make

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,799
distant objects appear closer than they

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,680
were it was a great night for observing

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,438
this

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,560
and betty told me that the radio was not

92
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,680
on

93
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,400
so all of that was false

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:05,360
then i believe it was march 4 1993

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,760
i had already started investigating this

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,879
but carl sagan again

97
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,759
published an article in parade magazine

98
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,598
that was read by thousands and thousands

99
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,039
of people

100
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:21,918
and in that article he wrote that betty

101
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,080
and barney were driving through the

102
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,198
desolate area in the white mountains at

103
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,159
night

104
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,280
that

105
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,880
benny

106
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:34,319
cited a star-like object

107
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,600
and that it seemed to be following him

108
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:41,839
nervous they turned off the main highway

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,240
onto narrow winding mountain roads

110
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:48,000
home later than anticipated

111
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,879
and then two weeks later she had a dream

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,439
about

113
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,839
being abducted and convinced barney that

114
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,560
they had both been abducted

115
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,519
that was also a lie

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
well

117
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,399
stan friedman who went to the university

118
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,280
of chicago he was a classmate of carl

119
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,359
sagan they were adversaries and

120
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,679
about ufos

121
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,199
carl sent a review copy of this article

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
to stamp

123
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
and stan

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,400
wrote back single-spaced

125
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,560
a 12-page letter

126
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,638
pointing out all of the mistakes that

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,600
carl had made

128
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,319
well

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,919
this was two months before the article

130
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,519
was published

131
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,198
and

132
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,680
paul changed only one thing

133
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,280
and that was he said that betty and

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,319
barney were a childless couple

135
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,359
and barney had two sons by a previous

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,639
marriage and that he had adopted her

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,919
first husband's three children

138
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,038
he changed that he didn't change any of

139
00:05:53,918 --> 00:06:00,159
the rest of his misinformation

140
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:03,360
and even though he was an astronomer he

141
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,400
played amateur psychologist in this and

142
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,360
if you attended my lecture yesterday you

143
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:12,799
learned about hypnagogic sleep states

144
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,720
hip and sleep states slim paralysis

145
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,439
and that sort of thing

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,160
carl was completely wrong when he was

147
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:25,519
talking about the idea that this

148
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,439
a hallucination that a hallucination

149
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:31,680
could actually explain ufo abduction

150
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,560
because we know that it's internally

151
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,959
generated if there's absolutely no

152
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,720
physical evidence in a hallucination

153
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,839
and in a hallucination it it is very

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
short

155
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:48,719
you don't have a complex narrative in a

156
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
hallucination that's a delusion

157
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,478
so

158
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,478
let us begin

159
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,560
like to introduce you to my aunt and

160
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,399
uncle betty and barney hill

161
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,598
betty was born on june 28 1919

162
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,120
she was the oldest child of florence and

163
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,839
raymond barrett

164
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,478
she grew up in south kingston new

165
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,799
hampshire and

166
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,639
there were five children in the family

167
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,439
my mother was betty's younger sister

168
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,639
betty was a very bright child at a time

169
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,800
when very few people went on to college

170
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,960
betty did go to college

171
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,439
she graduated from college with a degree

172
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,598
in social work she worked for the state

173

the last one did metastasize the others

183

he had an iq of 140 very bright student

192
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,880
he wanted to become a civil engineer he

193
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,399
was advised that because he was

194
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,000
african-american

195
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,919
there was no work for him in that field

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,159
he would never be hired

197
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,719
he became discouraged he dropped out of

198
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,360
high school and went into the army just

199
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,480
before the outbreak of world war ii

200
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,240
he later went back and did earn his high

201
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,720
school diploma

202
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,839
but during world war ii he served

203
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,278
honorably he was a truck driver and a

204
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,480
marksman

205
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,879
he was wounded during the war discharged

206
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,360
in fair condition and his military

207
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,559
records state that he was an excellent

208
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,120
character he worked for the post office

209
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:22,559
married and had two children

210
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,639
he and his first wife divorced he met

211
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,278
benny they were both

212
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:30,399
activists in the civil rights movement

213
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,958
although they never intended to

214
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,200
fall in love and get married it was

215
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,958
pretty difficult during that time and

216
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,600
certainly in the state of virginia where

217
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,838
he grew up there were anti-miscegenation

218
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,800
laws so it was against the law for them

219
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,399
to even enter that state as a married

220
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,958
couple

221
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,039
along the 17 other states

222
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,958
but they were married

223
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:57,360
and they had a very good marriage

224
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,119
this is the dog dalcy who is along on

225
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,600
the trip

226
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,078
delsie also experienced some physical

227
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,200
physiological problems after the

228
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:12,000
encounter with the ufo she developed a

229
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,360
fungus infection and she had what seemed

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,720
to be nightmares and these were new

231
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,480
she would woof

232
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,040
while she was sleeping and her little

233
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:26,079
legs would run and betty said that this

234
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:29,199
was not characteristic behavior for dels

235
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:34,319
well betty and barney left for niagara

236
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,720
falls on september 17 1961

237
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,120
they hadn't had a

238
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,040
great honeymoon they got married in new

239
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,278
jersey and then traveled to betty's home

240
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,519
in portsmouth new hampshire

241
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,519
barney wanted to surprise betty she had

242
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,639
a week's vacation from the welfare

243
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,200
department

244
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,120
and he asked for a few days off from his

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,079
job post office

246
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,159
and

247
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,159
surprised her with this trip

248
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,639
i think that they probably went because

249
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,759
uh i had gone to niagara falls about a

250
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,639
month before that and i enjoyed it so

251
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,879
much

252
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,039
i was showing betty and barney my

253
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,759
photographs and talking about it betty

254
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,480
had never been to niagara falls so i

255
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:21,679
think that's what gave barney the idea

256
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,519
and i also like to show this photograph

257
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:28,319
of myself because the debunkers all say

258
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,159
that i was only three years old when all

259
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,879
of this happened you couldn't possibly

260
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,519
remember what i'm talking about and you

261
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,838
can obviously see that i was not three i

262
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,360
was thirteen

263
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,000
well this is the route that betty and

264
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,360
barney took on that group they first

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,600
went to niagara falls then they drove up

266
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,278
spent the night in the thousand islands

267
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,680
area and went on to montreal the next

268
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,958
day on the 19th they thought they'd

269
00:11:53,679 --> 00:12:00,239
spend the night in montreal but uh the

270
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:02,559
road signs were in french

271
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,039
everyone was speaking for it when barney

272
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,319
went to ask for directions when he was

273
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,319
lost

274
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,800
they showed him the men's room so he and

275
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,278
he didn't have a good map of the suit

276
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,838
so he decided to just drive to the

277
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,240
outskirts and drive on and if they

278
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,279
retired that they would stop on their

279
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,759
way home somewhere along the line they

280
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,278
did hear that there was a hurricane

281
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,919
coming up the post and thought it would

282
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,679
be a good idea if they did travel to

283
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,039
portsmouth that night

284
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,599
but and barney was accustomed to staying

285
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,958
up all night long he worked graveyard

286
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,959
shift in the post office

287
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,000
this is the road that they took

288
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,240
they took from montreal down from new

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,240
hampshire northern new hampshire

290
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,919
they went to montreal to coast

291
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,240
on route 112 and then from poetical they

292
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:03,199
took 141

293
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,200
down to route 3 to colburn new hampshire

294
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,319
this is co-adco

295
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,200
if you read uh or have heard anything

296
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,399
that the bunkers will tell you they have

297
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,000
said that

298
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,120
barney uh

299
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,720
was

300
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,278
so upset

301
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,920
beep by because he was confronted by

302
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,559
woodlands when he was in canada and that

303
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:28,240
they harassed him because he was a big

304
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:31,278
white woman and that this caused him so

305
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,240
much emotional distress that when he was

306
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,799
looking up at that alleged ufo that was

307
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,879
actually a conventional aircraft he

308
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:43,599
hallucinated hoodlums looking back down

309
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,559
well all of that of course is false as

310
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,839
well

311
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,879
betty and barney did go into a

312
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,680
restaurant in koat cook

313
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,679
he

314
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,559
did see young men in there there were

315
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:58,078
two young men who had what he called

316
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,759
duck bill haircuts he associated that

317
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,120
with hoodlums

318
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,958
and

319
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,879
uh went on guard momentarily but then he

320
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,319
discovered that there were very nice

321
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,278
young men they were dressed in

322
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,680
conventional clothing they ate they used

323
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,240
the rest of their canadian money and

324
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,399
they moved on and had a very pleasant

325
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,560
time at that restaurant

326
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,839
barney was a little upset with himself

327
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:26,479
because he realized that he had

328
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:29,279
stereotyped them and he really

329
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,440
had a problem with people stereotyping

330
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,439
in

331
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:38,078
well they were driving home along the

332
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:41,198
way they they traveled over a gravel

333
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:44,719
road was a very nice gravel road between

334
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,319
coattack and northern new hampshire as

335
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
dr simon

336
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,079
uh

337
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,720
asked barney what kind of mood he was in

338
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,879
he was looking for any distress and i

339
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:01,350
want to play for you now the first

340
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:04,399

343
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,839
okay it's not really clear these are the

344
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:41,439
original hypnosis tapes i did have them

345
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,639
put onto a cd but

346
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,519
they were not clear to begin with but

347
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,320
barney was stating that he was in good

348
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,399
spirits he was in high spirits he had a

349
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,399
delightful dick

350
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,839
and he felt he could drive on down to

351
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
new hampshire without a problem

352
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,599
so they passed through us customs

353
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,839
in canaan vermont

354
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,440
and this is the route that they took

355
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,279
through

356
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,079
the northern and central part of new

357
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:18,559
hampshire here we have colebrook here's

358
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,559
lancaster and his twin mountain

359
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,599
in colebrook they stopped for another

360
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,359
step

361
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,320
this was going to be their last

362
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,720
opportunity to have a cup of coffee

363
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,199
before they traveled on to new hampshire

364
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,040
they were about two to three hours

365
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,359
actually it was about three hours away

366
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,319
from their home in portsmouth i've

367
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,759
driven this route over and over again

368
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,920
measuring distance and time driving at

369
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,199
the rate of speed that barney reported

370
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,519
that he was driving and stopping

371
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,519
at the stops that he reportedly stopped

372
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,799
at in in order to attempt to become lost

373
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,639
or in order to attempt to have missing

374
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,399
time

375
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,038
and i couldn't do

376
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,318
so they stopped at howard's restaurant

377
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,640
had a snack

378
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,599
they left the restaurant at 10 o'clock

379
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,319
they checked their watches

380
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,558
and they went on to lancaster

381
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,678
and they're driving along and just south

382
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,519
of lancaster was about 10 50 when they

383
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,400
arrived there so a little later than

384
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,279
that

385
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,440
uh benny noticed a new light in the sky

386
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:33,359
a month later she reported this to

387
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,919
walter webb from 9cap and i told you

388
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,959
about walter webb yesterday

389
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,038
about his background he was miss connor

390
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,240
he worked in the hayden planetarium in

391
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,720
boston

392
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,000
and he interviewed betty and barney

393
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,839
separate and together for six hours

394
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,240
and what they told him is that betty's

395
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,918
eyes were drawn to this new light in the

396
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,240
sky

397
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,120
the couple initially thought they were

398
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,558
observing a fallen star only it moved

399
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,798
upward a plane or a satellite

400
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:10,720
so though that is a quote

401
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:14,240
of what walter wrote in his original

402
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,279
confidential report

403
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,558
well

404
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,000
they continued to watch this as barney

405
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,399
drove along

406
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,599
watching the road and it was coming

407
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,880
closer and closer and it really spurred

408
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,079
her interest

409
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,840
and she told barney she wanted to stop

410
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,759
so that she could get a better look at

411
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,240
this through binoculars

412
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,200
he really didn't want to he wanted to

413
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,558
drive on he was a confirmed skeptic he

414
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,200
didn't believe that ufos were real but

415
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,519
she told him that delsi was restless and

416
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,400
chelsea needed to go for a walk

417
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,960
so he did stop he found a roadside stop

418
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,240
at the mount cleveland picnic area south

419
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,679
of twin mountain it was about 11 20 when

420
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,759
they arrived there on my calculations

421
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,000
and they got out of the car

422
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:08,119
and i'm going to play for you

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,119
what betty saw

424
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,489
[Music]

425
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,798
i saw

426
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,798
it travel across the whole face

427
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:39,399
and it was flashing all different

428
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,400
colored lights

429
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,960
robert schaefer will tell you that this

430
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,639
was

431
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,160
the plan of jupiter

432
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,960
that betty saw

433
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,038
and benny wrote to him is that you know

434
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,919
confident planet jupiter

435
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,319
crossed in front of the face of the moon

436
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,440
flashing multi-colored lights

437
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,399
and he

438
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,519
replied in a very very nasty letter he

439
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,000
kind of a nasty guy too bad

440
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,200
and all and continues to tell the same

441
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,480
story

442
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,480
after all of these years

443
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,759
so barney got out of the car he had

444
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,879
walked dowsing he went to the trunk of

445
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,279
the car and removed a pistol the reason

446
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,640
he did that is because they were in a

447
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:29,519
picnic area there were bears in the area

448
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,559
and he was afraid that the bears would

449
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,119
come out of the woods and

450
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,440
he was a city person and he was afraid

451
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:41,678
of bears so he he took the gun out for

452
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,480
protection against the bears initially

453
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,720
um

454
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,279
what he did is he took the binoculars

455
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,759
from betty and watched this craft as it

456
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,879
traveled toward vermont

457
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,480
in a northwest direction and then

458
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,240
without turning

459
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,319
it suddenly shot back at him so rapidly

460
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,679
that he could see the windows in it at

461
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,359
that point

462
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:09,840
it was unconventional it was silent and

463
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,839
it did not have conventional lighting

464
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,600
next they entered franconia this was

465
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,519
four miles south of the mountain

466
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,918
cleveland picnic area

467
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:23,359
this is franconia notch in the fall it's

468
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:27,038
a beautiful tourist area

469
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:30,319
as they passed by cannon mountain

470
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:33,200
betty noticed the tower on top of cannon

471
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:35,839
mountain the craft passed over the top

472
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,720
of the tower and the steady light on the

473
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,000
tower blinked out as the craft passed

474
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,319
over

475
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,038
they decided to stop again

476
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,839
they stopped by the old man of the

477
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,798
mountain which is on the backside of

478
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:54,798
cannon mountain and that this base fell

479
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:58,400
as a stone granite profile it fell in

480
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:01,200
may of 2003 it was our state symbol

481
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,280
unfortunately and we no longer have it

482
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,440
but uh if the important part here

483
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,599
is that between

484
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,038
the old man's forehead

485
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:17,359
and chin was 48 feet

486
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:20,400
and that is important because they said

487
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:23,279
that the crap came around and stopped by

488
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,320
the old man's profile and it was at

489
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:29,839
least one and a half times the length of

490
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,839
the old man's profile

491
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,839
they have stopped they've gotten out of

492
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,880
the vehicle what you're seeing here is

493
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:44,639
profile lake it's just underneath the

494
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,559
old man's profile and actually he fell

495
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,038
into part of him fell into the lake in

496
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:54,000
2003 and i'm going to play for you now

497
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:59,640
barney's description of what he saw when

498
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,640
he got out of the car on the second stop

499
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,558
it was about

500
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,679
a thousand feet i guess

501
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,759
all right

502
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,440
i

503
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:34,319
know this is not a peppercorn

504
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,960
it was too fast

505
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,960
it moved

506
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,480
before the west

507
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,360
and without

508
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,278
looking as if it turned it would come

509
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:03,158
straight back

510
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,159
it would go back up

511
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:22,079
straight up and come straight back

512
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,278
without a circle

513
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,678
and i think only a jet could fly that

514
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,679
fast

515
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,359
so we returned to the car barney was

516
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,400
driving very slowly at this point to

517
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:41,278
prank honey a notch while betty was

518
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,919
watching the craft as it traveled along

519
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,079
the top of the mountains sometimes

520
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,640
coming down in front of the mountain

521
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,439
sometimes behind the mountain

522
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,080
it

523
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,960
was traveling sometimes in a sphere step

524
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,558
pattern and she was very intrigued by

525
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,720
what she was seeing

526
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,440
they came out of frank honey a notch at

527
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,919
indian head this is indian head and

528
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,720
right across the street from indian head

529
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,038
are some cabins the indian county resort

530
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,079
is there now it's a beautiful resort i

531
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:15,038
highly recommend that you go there and

532
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,879
stay there if you go to new hampshire

533
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,599
they are currently

534
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,520
uh erecting a monument to betty and

535
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,480
barney hill and they will have a travel

536
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,119
guide

537
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,440
so that you can actually

538
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,319
if you stay there get their travel guide

539
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,880
and follow this route yourself

540
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,439
so i'm pretty excited about the fact

541
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,278
that there will be a monument for betty

542
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,240
and barney there

543
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:45,519
but getting back to what happened next

544
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,359
barney stated to dr simon when he saw

545
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,480
these cabins that he

546
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,798
felt

547
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,200
safe and less of the barren hostility of

548
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,480
the wooded area he said i've been there

549
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,319
before and i feel comforted that i see a

550
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,798
familiar place

551
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,918
betty was becoming excited and barney

552
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:06,319
said benny rarely became excited over

553
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,320
anything

554
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,440
so he thought maybe he'd find a place

555
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,759
where he could pull over again and he's

556
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,440
driving around and looking then he saw

557
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,879
nature land which was a little tourist

558
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,320
area

559
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,039
and

560
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:26,960
couldn't pull over there but as he was

561
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:30,158
driving along he was forced to stop

562
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,880
the craft had shifted ahead and stopped

563
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,840
just to the right of u.s highway route

564
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,440
3. and this is the off-season there were

565
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,519
not other vehicles

566
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,440
on the road then if you go there now

567
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,278
it's pretty heavily populated it's very

568
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,159
different you'll see cars

569
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,440
but at that time of night

570
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,360
on that night

571
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,679
betty and barney did not see another

572
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,759
vehicle and it's a good thing because

573
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,400
barney stopped that car right in the

574
00:26:53,759 --> 00:27:00,558
middle of the highway straddling the

575
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,440
center strip center line and got out to

576
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:05,599
look at this craft and while betty sat

577
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,640
in the car watching it

578
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,798
and

579
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,000
he said it continued to have a forward

580
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:14,558
look facing me as if it swung and did

581
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,599
not move from its position but just

582
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,798
swung from position with the front still

583
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,798
facing me and it moved to my left and i

584
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:26,000
continued to look and

585
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:28,639
walking across the highway that's why he

586
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,880
told walter webb in the confidential

587
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,679
report in october 1961

588
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,000
he also told walter the figures were

589
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,640
dressed in shiny black uniforms and

590
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,880
black cats with bills they reminded

591
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,360
barney the cold precision of german

592
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,520
officers the leader of the window held a

593
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,359
special attraction for

594
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,240
he could almost feel the leader's

595
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,479
intense concentration to carry out a

596
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,798
plane

597
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,919
was questioned about this event several

598
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,359
times by dr simon and what i'm going to

599
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,200
play for you now

600
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,479
is the tape of bonnie's first hypnotic

regression

602
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,640
uh with dr simon so that you can

603
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:15,119
actually hear the intensity of emotion

604
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,600
in his voice as he relived this

605
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,239
experience this is the point where he

606
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:23,240
experienced just after this a mental

607
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,240
block

608
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,788

609
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,320
i know

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,558
all right

611
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,558
oh

612
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,759
this

613
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,398
before

615
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,640

everybody who

617
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,320
everyone was standing there looking at

618
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,480
me

619
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,740
but everybody moved

620
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,838
to these zebras or in the back or they

in the sky

you can see you can hear the intensity

627
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,798
of emotion

628
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,000
uh in barney's response to what he saw

629
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,278
on board that crap he had a conscious

630
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,960
recollection

631
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:16,558
of encountering a non-human being

632
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,519
and he in his original report on in

633
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:23,440
october of 1961

634
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,159
described what he saw to walter west

635
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,120
he simply could not remember their

636
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,399
facial features at that point there was

637
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:35,439
something about them that terrified him

638
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:37,599
and caused him to have a mental block

639
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,840
now i'm going to play

640
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,359
the same kind of rendition

641
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,278
but this is

642
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:49,119
a later hypnotic regression and barney

643
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:53,359
has uh calmed down he's undergone his

644
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:58,359
reaction and catharsis and now he is

645
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,359
more rational about his experience

646
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,399
i

647
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,320
noticed with my monaco's that there were

648
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:11,439
about 11 minutes

649
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,480
now

650
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,399
i thought

651
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,880
looking down at me

652
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,759
and they suddenly made a

653
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,799
turn

654
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:24,158
to what i thought was a panel

655
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:27,359
and i could see their arms going up

656
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,320
and there was one that kept looking down

657
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,199
and i kept going closer

658
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:35,119
and

659
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,640
i could see two red lights coming out

660
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,278
from the tip

661
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,559
of this thing that did not look like a

662
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,519
plane at all or a helicopter

663
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:44,960
and

664
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,480
i could see

665
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,600
a long something coming down from the

666
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,399
center

667
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,759
and

668
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,678
i kept going closer and closer

669
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,599
and i thought oh my god

670
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,399
what is this thing

671
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,359
and

672
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,759
i

673
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:07,278
felt myself being told to come closer

674
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:10,798
and i was greatly confused and i built

675
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:13,919
my eyes and i thought this can't be real

676
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,720
and i shook my head and turned it away

677
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,759
and looked back and i thought oh god

678
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,480
it's there what is this thing and i put

679
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:24,640
my hand towards my gun and i could not

680
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,360
put my hand there and i could not

681
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,399
understand why my hands kept going up

682
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,719
with the binoculars and i was told to

683
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,278
keep the binoculars up and keep looking

684
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,159
up and keep coming closer no problem

685
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,798
will come to me and that's when i opened

686
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,440
my hands and the binoculars fell around

687
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,440
my neck and i ran

688
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,759
screaming back to the car

689
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,320
that they were going to capture us and

690
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,440
yet i could not understand what they

691
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:56,398
wanted to capture us for and i thought i

692
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,919
should report this to the police if ever

693
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:02,798
i could find a car box or anything or a

694
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,759
restaurant open because this was very

695
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:08,639
unusual for something to do that and i

696
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,280
thought of the military and i thought

697
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,519
since they had on black jack the one

698
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,720
looking at me having a black jacket he

699
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,918
must have been

700
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,480
a military officer and yet i could not

701
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,638
quite understand why they were doing

702
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,320
what they were doing and there was no

703
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,280
sound coming from this thing

704
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,240
okay

705
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,720
barney did run back to the vehicle

706
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,279
thinking that he was

707
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,959
in danger of being captured and he

708
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:43,119
stated that as he entered his car

709
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,119
the craft moved overhead

710
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,760
and

711
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,960
when it did he started speeding down the

712
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,520
highway

713
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,480
and i'm going to play for you now what

714
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,480
betty described because as that craft

715
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,039
hovered over their vehicle

716
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,358
they've heard a series of beeping what

717
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,000
they call beeping sounds code like

718
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,639
mechanical beeping sounds what barney

719
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,639
called buzzing sounds in

720
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,639
different words to describe the same

721
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,639
thing

722
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,459
[Music]

723
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,039
i don't know

724
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,680
it is that's all i can think of is some

725
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,358
sort of electrical signal

726
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,039
somebody's just just you know with busy

727
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,880
business and i thought well i want to oh

728
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,559
god why didn't i go to the lobster

729
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,838
because maybe this is the most problem i

730
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,679
don't know

731
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,039
and i thought

732
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,879
a winter coat

733
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,440
this is the shot you get if you don't

734
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,480
like it so i put my hair up in the

735
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,240
middle of the track

736
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,679
and i kept feeling this feeling and i

737
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:01,759
didn't feel any uh shock electric shock

738
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:03,919
but the hotel was vibrating

739
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,839
the whole car was vibrating and that

740
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,240
vibration

741
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,719
caused a tingling sensation to pass

742
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,358
through betty's and barney's bodies

743
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:16,399
when that happened they stopped speaking

744
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,279
to each other and they didn't speak

745
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,160
again

746
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,359
until they were 35 miles down the

747
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,519
highway and it seemed that only an

748
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,480
instant had passed

749
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,679
as i listen to their separate hypnosis

750
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,679
tapes

751
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:36,480
they suddenly find themselves on a new

752
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,000
robe that they haven't been on before

753
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,320
and there are tall trees all around

754
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,480
betty attempted to find a rational

755
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,760
explanation and just thought they must

756
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,320
have been continuing to drive down u.s

757
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,520
highway route 3 and then made a

758
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,559
left-hand turn onto route 175

759
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,880
which runs parallel to root three but

760
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,799
there's no evidence of that on the

761
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,559
hypnosis tapes

762
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,280
so somehow

763
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:09,119
they got from group three over to route

764
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,320
175 to a new area

765
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,160
it was a long pause after these

766
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,640
beeping and buzzing sounds and suddenly

767
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,799
they're in a new location perhaps that

768
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,879
craft picked their car up

769
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,000
it's been note they have been known to

770
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,000
pick up other cars

771
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,720
so let's take a look

772
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,320
at their

773
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,239
timeline is the first stop at 10 50

774
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,320
south of twin mountain here's the old

775
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:45,199
man of the mountain the second stop at

776
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,960
about 11 50. actually betty said that

777
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:50,159
as they passed cannon mountain she

778
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,159
glanced at her watch and it was 11 20.

779
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,440
so i'm going to have been a little too

780
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:57,440
liberal but i wanted to make sure that i

781
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,960
added time

782
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,720
uh to this

783
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,920
to

784
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,279
try to

785
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,079
find a rational or mundane explanation

786
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,920
for what happened to them so

787
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,960
i may be off there

788
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,599
here's the encounter field the third

789
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,400
stop that was about 12 15 by my

790
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,680
calculation and down here

791
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,680
is the capture site

792
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,719
the hills remember to roadblock and they

793
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,880
remembered men in the road they didn't

794
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,159
know when or where it occurred this is

795
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,480
part of their conscious recollection

796
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:39,358
they remembered a fiery oar

797
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,639
and i'm going to play for you now

798
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:45,960
what barney

799
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,960
told dr simon about that fiery lord

800
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,400
how can

801
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,159
the moon be on the highway

802
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,960
in that kind of position

803
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:57,199
and i can never seem to find any

804
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,480
uh terrain up there that would fit what

805
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,239
i sort of definitely remember that they

806
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,719
were sitting there like and i kept

807
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,078
remembering you just writing it down

808
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,358
and then i

809
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,800
don't remember

810
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,279
and now i

811
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,280
remember

812
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:17,598
see this was after the hypnosis

813
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,119
he always had these shadowy memories of

814
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,680
a roadblock

815
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,119
he and betty consciously recalled his

816
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,399
fiery orb

817
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,119
they attempted to rationalize that

818
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,320
perhaps it was the moon setting

819
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,320
but it didn't fit the characteristics

820
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,200
of a setting moon

821
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,200
and

822
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,078
barney realized that

823
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:43,078
this object was moving but he was not

824
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,079
moving

825
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,000
well then they drove on they passed

826
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,480
through plymouth new hampshire

827
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,039
and they heard their second series of

828
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,519
code line beeping or buzzing sounds this

829
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,199
brought them back to full consciousness

830
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,480
this is when

831
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:03,279
barney stopped the car he shifted from

832
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,920
side to side on the road he attempted to

833
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,640
create this type of sound and wasn't

834
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,358
able to do that betty said to him well

835
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,598
now you believe in flying saucers and he

836
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,039
said don't be ridiculous there's no such

837
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,640
thing

838
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:18,719
and

839
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,078
then they

840
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:25,759
drove down here's plymouth ashland

841
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:29,280
this is actually a 1960 road map of new

842
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,920
hampshire in north field they recalled

843
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,040
seeing a sign that said 17 miles to

844
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,559
concord here's concord the state capitol

845
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,119
and then they

846
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,199
made a beeline over here to portsmouth

847
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,400
new hampshire thinking that they would

848
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,679
arrive at 3 00 a.m at the latest

849
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,599
but

850
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,199
it was 5 15.

851
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,760
they checked their watches and their

852
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,559
watches had both stopped but finding way

853
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:59,280
into the kitchen and check the clock

854
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:59,279
well betty walked delsie the dog

855
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,039
barney felt a strange sensation in his

856
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,920
groin he checked his groin went into the

857
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:11,759
bathroom didn't see anything then but a

858
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,800
couple of months later 21 three-quarter

859
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,359
inch groves had grown in a concentric

860
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,079
circle on his groin they were later

861
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:23,199
removed they became inflamed while he

862
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,280
was undergoing hypnosis with dr sun

863
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:28,239
the lab report confirmed that they were

864
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,880
not venereal warts

865
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:33,279
and betty felt planted as if they'd been

866
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,680
contaminated and they really did worry

867
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,640
about contamination

868
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,559
and there the watches that had stopped

869
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:43,598
never worked again

870
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:47,358
and his binocular strap was broken the

871
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,640
tops of his shoes were scraped not just

872
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:50,880
scuffed

873
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,440
but scraped and he was a meticulous

874
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,760
dress after that he had to wear these

875
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,440
shoes for yard work

876
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,440
they sat down in separate rooms and

877
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,079
betty sketched the

878
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,679
practice she recalled seeing it see it

879
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,800
from her position in the car

880
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:11,199
and this is barney's sketch he had uh

881
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,960
he had seen it from next to the car and

882
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,039
also from the field

883
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,000
and so he said this is how it looked

884
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:20,318
when it was about 200 feet high that was

885
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,639
when it was beside the highway on the

886
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,599
right side of the west side of their

887
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,239
vehicle

888
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,119
and then it descended to within about

889
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:32,239
100 feet of their vehicle and there was

890
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,720
a little red light on each side there

891
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:37,279
and this is how it uh looked when it

892
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,318
shifted over the highway descending to

893
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,720
about 100 feet over the field

894
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,119
and these little thin like structures

895
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,199
appear to come out with a red light on

896
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,920
each end and you can see the little

897
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:52,559
figures that he drew

898
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,358
the day he arrived home so if anyone

899
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,480
tells you that all of this was recovered

900
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:01,199
under hypnosis you have proof now that

901
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,119
they had full conscious recollection of

902
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,039
everything except for the abduction

903
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,599
itself

904
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:10,480
well faith took off her dress and when

905
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,400
she did she noticed that the zipper was

906
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,079
torn at the top

907
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,800
there was an inch

908
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,440
one and a half inch tier on one side

909
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,079
uh an inch tear on the other side there

910
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,639
was a tear in the zipper fabric and in

911
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,359
the stitching this was a new dress how

912
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:30,078
did this happen to a woman

913
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:32,719
riding as a passenger in a vehicle down

914
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,720
the highway

915
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,480
uh the lining was torn from waist to

916
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,039
hemlock

917
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,000
the ham was torn down on one side of her

918
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,880
dress

919
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,039
she folded him and placed it in her

920
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,039
closet knowing that she'd have to repair

921
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,679
it but the next time she took it out

922
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,960
there was a pink powdery substance on

923
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,598
that dress

924
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,159
she hung it out on the clothesline the

925
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,359
pink powder blew away but she noticed

926
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:03,838
that the dress was permanently stained

927
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:05,759
she decided to throw it away but that

928
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,078
unsecond thought

929
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,960
she thought that it might hold a clue to

930
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,280
what happened to her on that night so

931
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,000
she saved that dress and it has

932
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,680
undergone laboratory analysis five

933
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,440
separate times

934
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:24,799
no one has ever been able to identify

935
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:29,679
what that pink powdery substance is

936
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,359
i'm looking for a phd botanist who might

937
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,838
be able to look at it to see if it's

938
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:38,880
some kind of fungus or mold

939
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,880
um but if you go online to the black

940
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,920
vault encyclopedia

941
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,720
phyllis buzzinger his report is on there

942
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,639
it's at youtube uto

943
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,519
25

944
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,759
and i just want to point out

945
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,759
you can see here the blue

946
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,839
this is the blue color of the dress you

947
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,160
can see the discoloration

948
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,000
and something that betty told phyllis

949
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:06,000
had told me as well

950
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,280
is that the areas where they actually

951
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,800
touched her are the areas that were most

952
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,599
saturated by that pink powdery substance

953
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,119
they grabbed her with their very long

954
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,838
narrow hands

955
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,400
around her armpits

956
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,799
you can see on the hem where it dropped

957
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,358
onto the floor and also this

958
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,359
discoloration up in that zipper area

959
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,880
this is phyllis bunninger

960
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,838
uh she has a master's degree in

961
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,000
chemistry she's a research scientist

962
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,078
she's retired now she works as a

963
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
consultant sometimes and she has her own

964
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,480
laboratory

965
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,838
she worked for pe amaco

966
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,679
which was formerly standard oil for 35

967
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:56,559
years so specialized

968
00:45:53,679 --> 00:46:01,679
in petroleum chemical and polymer

969
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:03,039
analysis using spectroscopic techniques

970
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,559
and

971
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,440
i have such a high degree of respect for

972
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,000
her

973
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,720
she did the most thorough chemical

974
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,199
analysis of anybody

975
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:18,159
i write about it in the book or you can

976
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,318
go online for the full 47-page

977
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:21,598
report that she wrote

978
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:25,119
there was

979
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:28,800
an oil-type substance on the exterior of

980
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:32,640
that dress that did not belong to them

981
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,480
this was externally deposited there by

982
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,039
something else

983
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,240
uh so quite interesting

984
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,440
phyllis

985
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,358
ended up

986
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,200
this is an i'm going to phone her she

987
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,000
wrote this to me

988
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,799
her conclusion was i am convinced that

989
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,039
the event did happen as determined by

990
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,760
the chemical analysis i did on betty

991
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:53,759
hill's dress

992
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,119
well

993
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,838
betty then phoned my mother

994
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,559
bonnie said that uh they should never

995
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:06,799
tell anybody about this no good could

996
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,039
possibly come out telling anyone about

997
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,880
this event so many then went to the

998
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,199
telephone and immediately called my

999
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,200
mother

1000
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,079
her sister

1001
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,200
and uh and had to talk to her

1002
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,920
it uh

1003
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,239
because betty was so concerned

1004
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,720
that they might be contaminated and we

1005
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,799
had a neighbor who was a physicist

1006
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,118
my mother called the neighbor and he

1007
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,599
suggested for some reason and i'll never

1008
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,160
understand this but he suggested that

1009
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,400
betty take a compass if she had one and

1010
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,399
go out to the car and

1011
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,160
to see how the needle on the compass

1012
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,000
would react now we know it's going to

1013
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,399
fluctuate when you put it over the

1014
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,318
engine and put it over the battery but

1015
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,838
she's sorry i'm going to let her tell

1016
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,838
you

1017
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:52,838
postmortem

1018
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,519
shiny

1019
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,519
and

1020
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,680
it had been raining

1021
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,760
that day

1022
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:19,039
and uh the cow was all wet stole that

1023
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,480
and

1024
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,558
i thought well

1025
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,920
i started

1026
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,920
on the side of the calf

1027
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,358
to see what would happen and i kept

1028
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,480
going

1029
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:34,719
closer and closer to the trunk

1030
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,480
and then it was when i started to go to

1031
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:37,679
the trunk of the compass but i noticed

1032
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,119
the

1033
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:43,118
shiny spots on the trunk

1034
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,800
that they were

1035
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,480
the very very shiny spots

1036
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,359
about the

1037
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,119
the hulk cluster album

1038
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,759
about the size of

1039
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,400
you know half dollars or

1040
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,119
salvador something like that

1041
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,119
and most of them

1042
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,639
twelve or eight noodles several for

1043
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:10,318
overdosing i would say

1044
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:12,318
all around this spot and very shiny

1045
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,800
and

1046
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,279
when i just kept a couple of anywhere

1047
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,440
near

1048
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,640
the league temple kepler spinning around

1049
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,639
and around and around

1050
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,680
and

1051
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,680
i at this like

1052
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:30,959
i got more

1053
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,400
well the debunkers will tell you that

1054
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,280
barney went out and experimented with

1055
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,720
the compass and the compass behaved

1056
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,720
normally it didn't spin and betty was

1057
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,279
making all of this up

1058
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:52,318
but let's hear from barney

1059
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,319
what happened

1060
00:49:55,358 --> 00:50:01,119
i said how can you not know if it isn't

1061
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,960
anything and then i put the compass

1062
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,519
close to it

1063
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,440
and the compass

1064
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,960
was bent

1065
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,960
and spin

1066
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,920
and i could move the compass a few

1067
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,159
inches to a spot

1068
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,519
that did not connect to a

1069
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,480
carbon

1070
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:22,000
on the trunk that did not have a spot

1071
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,838
and the compass

1072
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,599
would drop down

1073
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:30,799
and so you can see again that the

1074
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,800
debunkers are lying

1075
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,719
while those bombs were in the exact

1076
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,559
location where the hills said they heard

1077
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,959
the beeping or buzzing sound that caused

1078
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,480
their vehicle to vibrate and their

1079
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,800
bodies to tinkle

1080
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,280
i actually saw these spots as did the

1081
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,680
other members of my family we were at

1082
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,640
betty's house within a day or two of the

1083
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:55,679
time was occurred

1084
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:58,639
eddie washed and waxed her vehicle

1085
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,440
uh that fall but the spots would not rub

1086
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,679
out

1087
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,960
but they faded away over the winter of

1088
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:08,480
1961 and 1962

1089
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,920
and in my book captured

1090
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,559
i do have

1091
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,559
included a letter that betty

1092
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,800
wrote to walter webb

1093
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,519
about a meeting that she had with

1094
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,960
several air force officers about those

1095
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,079
spots and their opinions on what they

1096
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,599
might be

1097
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,359
uh

1098
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,240
a number of people have speculated that

1099
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:33,279
they might be just weather spots weather

1100
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:36,318
spots are caused when it rains and

1101
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:39,519
pollutants drop down from environmental

1102
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:42,079
pollutants drop down and deposit on the

1103
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:44,318
trunk of the car and then the sun comes

1104
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,000
out and bakes those environmental

1105
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:50,000
pollutants off

1106
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,719
you have to actually buy a chemical

1107
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,800
compound and rub those out you can't get

1108
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:57,598
them out

1109
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,119
but that is not what was on betty and

1110
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,440
barney's car

1111
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,599
that's not what they looked like

1112
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,200
it had been raining but the sun didn't

1113
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,559
come out

1114
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:10,078
it was continuing to rain that afternoon

1115
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,240
that evening

1116
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,599
and they had not been there the day

1117
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,399
before

1118
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:19,640
this is what they looked like

1119
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,639
not this

1120
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,400
well

1121
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,440
betty was excited she called my mother

1122
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,760
back

1123
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,440
and the chief of police of newton who

1124
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,480
was actually the former chief of police

1125
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,480
at that point he had

1126
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:39,759
shortly before that but he was my

1127
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,680
father's best friend and he came to the

1128
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,640
house every night and had a cup of

1129
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:45,679
coffee on his way home from work

1130
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,799
and

1131
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:51,039
he told betty that she should report

1132
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,480
this to the air force that the police

1133
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,119
departments and all received

1134
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,079
instructions from pease air force base

1135
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:01,039
to for people to call them to report

1136
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,480
their ufo science so that's what she and

1137
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:05,039
barney did

1138
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,838
and you can see the original report it's

1139
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:11,440
in the appendix of my book this is the

1140
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:12,400
original hand written report right here

1141
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,119
and

1142
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,960
already there's a cover-up going on it

1143
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:21,280
says there was a strong inversion in the

1144
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,440
lincoln-new hampshire area now we

1145
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,240
already know from what i've told you

1146
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,200
from

1147
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,039
the

1148
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,039
chief meteorologist from mount

1149
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,199
washington weather station that there

1150
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,358
was not a strong inversion that night

1151
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:35,519
when they passed through the inversions

1152
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,838
set up in some of the lower valleys the

1153
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,318
following morning after they had already

1154
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:42,960
arrived home

1155
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:46,079
and the original report up here you'll

1156
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,760
see that it's hand checked that

1157
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,880
it was picked up on air intercept radar

1158
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:56,720
and ground visual radar

1159
00:53:52,880 --> 00:54:00,318
uh and this is the radar report

1160
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,439
every other report after this does not

1161
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,199
have

1162
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:08,000
air intercept radar checked off

1163
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:10,558
dr james mcdonald said that he had

1164
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,590
actually seen the pilot's report that's

1165
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,000
what he told that

1166
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:16,559
[Music]

1167
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,079
that disappeared from the files it has

1168
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,079
never been seen again

1169
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,960
this is just the second page and there

1170
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,879
are several pages of the air

1171
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,960
intelligence report

1172
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,240
uh it's only a description of what you

1173
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,639
have already seen on my slides

1174
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:37,838
approximately 10 days after this

1175
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:40,239
experience betty had five disturbing

1176
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:42,078
nightmares or dreams they occurred early

1177
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,959
in the morning as

1178
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,920
just before she woke up barney was not

1179
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,798
sleeping with her because he was working

1180
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,880
nights at the post office

1181
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,719
they included her conscious memories of

1182
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,240
ufo sighting

1183
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:02,480
but sandwiched in between these events

1184
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:04,318
was a ufo abduction in these streams she

1185
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,159
rearranged she wrote them down she

1186
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:10,798
rearranged them and in november of

1187
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:13,920
1961 she wrote a five-page paper

1188
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:17,358
about what she had dreamed this has

1189
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,880
always created a lot of controversy

1190
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,159
because

1191
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,200
dr simon for one and this is dr simon

1192
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:28,399
hypothesized that perhaps

1193
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:31,519
betty had only repeated her dreams under

1194
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,798
hypnosis and that barney had created a

1195
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:37,838
fantasy and confabulated the information

1196
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:41,358
under hypnosis about an abduction he was

1197
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:44,318
really startled at how similar betty's

1198
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:45,920
and barney's stories were

1199
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:47,838
just couldn't believe that they were so

1200
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,639
similar and that had to come from

1201
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:53,279
someplace because of course ufos were

1202
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:56,159
not real and no one had ever been

1203
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,440
abducted so he was looking for another

1204
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:00,000
explanation

1205
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,639
but i told you yesterday about dr

1206
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,199
simon's credentials he was very

1207

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:16,798

1212
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,760
uh

1213
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,079
had a tremendous amount of success in

1214
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,480
treating post-traumatic stress disorder

1215
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,798

1219
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:41,759
lectured at harvard and he was skilled

1220
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,280
in deep trans hypnosis to resolve trump

1221
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,319
amnesia

1222
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,640
barney was referring to him because

1223
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:50,719
he was not able to resolve some

1224
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:53,358
physiological problems he was

1225
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,759
experiencing he was hospitalized with

1226
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:59,279
bleeding ulcers

1227
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,480
he was experiencing stress

1228
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,040
and

1229
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,760
he was not responding to traditional

1230
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:09,279
medical treatment so he was referred to

1231
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:12,640
another psychiatrist dr duncan stevens

1232
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,640
and one day when he was in dr steven's

1233
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,798
office he mentioned that he and betty

1234
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,519
had traveled to the white mountains the

1235
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:22,798
previous weekend to try to job their

1236
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:25,920
memories about this ufo experience that

1237
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:28,880
they had and the missing time and dr

1238
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,440
stevens thought that barney was very

1239
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,000
well adjusted he couldn't understand why

1240
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,000
he was experiencing these problems

1241
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,280
because there was nothing else in his

1242
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,920
life that should have caused that he did

1243
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,640
miss his sons who were in philadelphia

1244
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,639
but he saw them during vacations

1245
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:50,159
uh he thought there was something more

1246
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:52,558
bothering barney so he made the referral

1247
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,719
to dr simon

1248
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,720
and betty went with him

1249
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,798
they met with dr simon for the first

1250
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:01,759
time on

1251
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,280
december it was december 14th i believe

1252
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,000
1963

1253
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,720
they started hypnosis in january they

1254
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,039
underwent a period of conditioning and

1255
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,679
then on february 22nd

1256
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:16,000
1964

1257
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,078
barney underwent his first hypnotic

1258
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,838
regression session

1259
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,880
and uh what he said and what betty said

1260
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:26,400
as well

1261
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,640
and i did a comparative analysis in 1996

1262
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,079
betty turned all of the hypnosis tapes

1263
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:34,480
over to me i transcribed all of them for

1264
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,280
comparative analysis

1265
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:40,639
my background is in social science uh

1266
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,440
and i am now a hypnotherapist i was not

1267
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,039
them

1268
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,358
um i was a social worker i majored in

1269
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:51,279
psychiatric social work is what they

1270
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:54,880
called it back then in college and

1271
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:57,440
so i did this comparative analysis and i

1272
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,680
told you betty and barney suddenly found

1273
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,760
themselves on a new road and there were

1274
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,598
tall trees all around

1275
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,599
and barney said i kept driving and

1276
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,559
driving and i made a turn and i never

1277
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,838
knew this i don't know why i had to make

1278
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:15,519
that turn and that's when he saw that

1279
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:15,519
fiery orb in the road

1280
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,400
they then saw figures in the road and

1281
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:27,798
i'm going to play for you

1282
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,798
betty's description of what she saw

1283
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,920
that day

1284
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,318
then i thought well you know are they in

1285
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,480
the car and the car broke again or

1286
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,599
what are we doing there

1287
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,400
and

1288
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:47,640
i'm going to stop

1289
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,639
and then

1290
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:01,719
they

1291
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:06,480
they separated

1292
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:09,920
they came up with two groups

1293
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,920
and when they started to do that

1294
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,920
i was real scared

1295
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:57,119
open

1296
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,798
i

1297
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,598
thought i saw a cluster

1298
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,239
of

1299
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,240
six men

1300
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:24,000
because

1301
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,199
they came to me

1302
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,760
and three

1303
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:27,759
midnight

1304
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:30,960
i

1305
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,280
didn't think of the man

1306
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:41,358
in the

1307
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:44,639
he said he did not think of the man in

1308
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:46,480
the sky at that time he did think about

1309
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:48,480
going for his gun

1310
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,358
but you can see

1311
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,559
bobby said the three men went to his

1312
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:56,798
door he saw a cluster of six men

1313
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:59,200
three went to betty's door that's not in

1314
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,440
their dream material where did that come

1315
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:04,399
from

1316
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,400
unless it happened

1317
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:08,798
then um

1318
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,119
they were taken out of the car arnie

1319
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:13,599
stated under hypnosis that he could feel

1320
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,798
the tops of his feet bumping against the

1321
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,880
stones then he stated not under hypnosis

1322
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:21,280
but you don't

1323
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,920
report everything that happens when

1324
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,960
you're hypnotized you remember

1325
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,358
your experiences but you don't report

1326
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,760
every single little detail

1327
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:34,159
betty remembered struggling with her

1328
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,799
captors as they attempted to take her

1329
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:39,199
onto the craft and she said that this is

1330
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:42,079
the point where she tore

1331
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:44,960
the hem on her dress and the lining

1332
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,359
because she was fighting for her life

1333
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:50,000
and she kicked one of these guys as hard

1334
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:50,000
as she could

1335
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:57,920
but at that point they took control of

1336
01:02:55,039 --> 01:03:00,839
her again and she lost consciousness

1337
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:03,838
they took her into the craft and this is

1338
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:05,199
barney's uh diagram of the interior of

1339
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,358
the craft

1340
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,759
here's the ramp

1341
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,920
this is the side with the windows this

1342
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,920
was a darkened hallway

1343
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,318
barney was taken into this room there

1344
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,480
was a table and there was a cabinet here

1345
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:21,679
betty was taken into this room there was

1346
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:23,280
a table chair and cabinet here

1347
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:25,759
so this is

1348
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,798
barney's diagram

1349
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,680
now

1350
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:28,880
this

1351
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:32,719
is

1352
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:35,838
my composite of the aliens that betty

1353
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:37,038
described in her dreams i want to make

1354
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:40,159
that clear

1355
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:43,039
this is her dream alien

1356
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,558
they looked pretty human maybe southern

1357
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:48,480
european

1358
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:51,119
dark hair big hair dark eyebrows

1359
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:54,159
blue lips but they had lips they looked

1360
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:57,039
a lot like jimmy durante they had large

1361
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:59,759
long noses they would rest in

1362
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,240
uh cadet type uniforms

1363
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,480
and they were about five feet to five to

1364
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:06,078
four inches tall they were very human in

1365
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,318
appearance

1366
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:12,960
let's compare that to what betty and

1367
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:15,279
barney described after hypnosis

1368
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,798
very different

1369
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,559
scary

1370
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,599
this is the leader

1371
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,960
he had large chest cavity and spindly

1372
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,160
legs

1373
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:29,440
before they ever underwent hypnosis

1374
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:32,078
barney recalled the roadblock and he

1375
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:35,440
mentioned their spindly legs and how

1376
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:38,400
they were oddly jointed and how as they

1377
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,039
approached the car they were sort of

1378
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,760
shifting side to side

1379
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:47,039
very different from a human gate

1380
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,599
they described a membrane inside the

1381
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:53,200
mouth that flooded when they spoke to

1382
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:57,039
each other in their own kind of sort of

1383
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:59,118
mumbling or a humming type of language

1384
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:02,720
betty told me once that it reminded her

1385
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:04,480
of the low drone of a beehive

1386
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:07,279
or a hornet's nest

1387
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:10,400
they had large slanted eyes that they

1388
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:14,079
said were square had square corners

1389
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:16,798
they had a vertical cat-like pupil and

1390
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:20,160
the artist who actually drew this

1391
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:22,719
drew it more human-looking than benny

1392
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:25,279
said they actually were now betty and

1393
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:29,038
barney described uh

1394
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:31,760
an iris that filled up most of the white

1395
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,839
area of the eye only a very tiny bit of

1396
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:37,200
white was showing and that was yellowish

1397
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:39,038
in color so this uh this painting is not

1398
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,199
completely accurate

1399
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,559
this one was the leader was about five

1400
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:45,199
feet tall

1401
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:48,559
they understood him in english

1402
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:51,439
although she did not see his mouth move

1403
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:54,400
barney also understood him in english

1404
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:57,119
although he did not see is not moved

1405
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:00,000
that is not in

1406
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:02,480
betty's dreams or recall

1407
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,639
this is the examiner the original

1408
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,960
examiner painting was stolen from

1409
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:10,558
betty's house i commissioned patrick

1410
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:13,280
richard from new mexico to

1411
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,240
do this painting of the examiner

1412
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:19,359
and the examiner held a weaker chin

1413
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:21,759
betty thought perhaps this was female

1414
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:24,798
but didn't know for sure

1415
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:28,240
he was about four and a half feet tall

1416
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:30,480
very much like the the leader they had

1417
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:33,519
these long narrow

1418
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:36,798
palms of their hands and they had

1419
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:41,358
probably three long fingers and one that

1420
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:41,358
was shorter from what betty could recall

1421
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:46,639
this is a side view

1422
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,719
drawn by the original artist david baker

1423
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:51,440
from new hampshire and there was one

1424
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:53,279
that they didn't talk about

1425
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,880
the scientists working with them asked

1426
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:59,519
not to disclose this information because

1427
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,559
they wanted to know if other people had

1428
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:05,440
had this experience as well and if they

1429
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:08,720
had they might mention another group on

1430
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:11,200
board this craft this one was only about

1431
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:13,118
three and a half feet tall i call him

1432
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,919
the supervisor because he stood in the

1433
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:18,960
darkened hallway and he was incredibly

1434
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,119
frightening to betty she kept her eyes

1435
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,960
closed a lot because she couldn't stand

1436
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:28,000
to look at him he had larger eyes and a

1437
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:32,000
larger head in proportion to his body

1438
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,358
than the leader and the examiner

1439
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,318
well

1440
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:35,838
from

1441
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:38,318
what i could

1442
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:41,358
discover by listening to and

1443
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,400
transcribing the hypnosis tapes it

1444
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:45,119
appears

1445
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,079
that these alien beings were interested

1446
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:50,880
in the human skeletal structure they

1447
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:54,798
examined base and barney's hands and

1448
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:58,079
feet and joints their eyes their skin

1449
01:07:54,798 --> 01:08:01,280
their mouth their reproductive systems

1450
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:04,000
and many specimens were taken from their

1451
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:07,039
bodies skin scrapings

1452
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,440
um perhaps ova from betty

1453
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,559
there was a sperm test sample taken from

1454
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,358
barney

1455
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,640
uh just about every order was open in

1456
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:17,359
their body

1457
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:20,079
bodies were entered

1458
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,039
as separate betty's underwear did remain

1459
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:23,278
on

1460
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:24,798
uh here's betty

1461
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,120
she underwent

1462
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:30,798
a needle in the navel test this is

1463
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:32,719
before we had amniosa

1464
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:34,479
and i'm going to play for you now

1465
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:37,480
betty's description of what she

1466
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,479
experienced

1467
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,158
on my back

1468
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:03,920
and the excitement

1469
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:07,238
has a long needle

1470
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,239
in his hand

1471
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,759
i could kill him

1472
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,239
every day

1473
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,560
reader

1474
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,320
he does overstay

1475
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,840
put his son

1476
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:10,719
around this time

1477
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,719
from your eyes

1478
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:16,079
and he says i'll be all right

1479
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:18,559
i won't feel it

1480
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:18,559
come on

1481
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:26,548
get all the page all the way

1482
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,548
[Music]

1483
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:33,119
this was all seven betty's dream

1484
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:35,839
material the difference between this and

1485
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:38,800
betty's dreams is that

1486
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,960
she experienced so much trauma as she

1487
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,000
was going through reliving this

1488
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,640
experience that dr simon actually had to

1489
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,439
end the session early

1490
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:52,960
we don't know for sure if this actually

1491
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:56,479
happened because we can't i was not able

1492
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:59,439
to verify beyond a reasonable doubt

1493
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:02,799
anything that happened individually to

1494
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:04,960
betty and barney on board the craft only

1495
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,239
there's their statements of what

1496
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:11,359
happened when they were together

1497
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:13,919
so there's a good chance it did but i

1498
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,639
don't have what i would call scientific

1499
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:19,679
evidence that it did

1500
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:23,360
well stan friedman may have talked about

1501
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:26,880
the star map to you uh if he hasn't yet

1502
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:29,599
i'm sure he will so i'm going to

1503
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,400
go over this rather quickly this is his

1504
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,039
area of expertise he was the first one

1505
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:38,559
to publish on the star map and he wrote

1506
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:41,600
the chapter on the start out in captured

1507
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:44,320
by betty said to the leader

1508
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,560
after the examiner had left to work on

1509
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,319
barney i know you're not from around

1510
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,920
here where are you from

1511
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:53,599
and so he produced a star map that was

1512
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,840
three-dimensional it was like a

1513
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,079
holographic image

1514
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,079
from the wall

1515
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:02,719
and

1516
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,920
dr simon gave betty the post-hypnotic

1517
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,399
suggestion

1518
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,880
that she would be able to draw this when

1519
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:11,198
she went home if and only if she could

1520
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,840
remember it accurately and it didn't

1521
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:16,879
cause her too much distress

1522
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,319
some of the stars she did go home and do

1523
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,119
this and some of the stars were

1524
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:24,719
pinpoints and others were as big as a

1525
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:27,439
nickel these solid lines represented

1526
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:30,319
trade routes so you can see trade routes

1527
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:33,359
here here's the sun up here

1528
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:38,319
um so you can see solid lines and then

1529
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:38,319
the dotted lines represented expeditions

1530
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,199
his margarine fish was stan friedman

1531
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:47,119
this is back in the 70s i believe

1532
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:50,639
marjorie was the school teacher from

1533
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:53,359
ohio she was also a member of mensah

1534
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:57,039
she was unmarried and

1535
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:59,839
had plenty of time on her hands to

1536
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:02,840
express her interest and to research the

1537
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,920
start out she reasoned that if it really

1538
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:08,719
existed she would be able to find this

1539
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,800
place in our galaxy perhaps so she

1540
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,319
started building three-dimensional

1541
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,679
models using

1542
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:15,759
silk

1543
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,840
string and

1544
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:21,600
beads

1545
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:24,719
in all she built 26 models before she

1546
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,760
was able to find a match

1547
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,439
it took her four years to find the match

1548
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,480
the hard part wasn't getting the

1549
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:33,759
accurate distance data because you can't

1550
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,639
just

1551
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:39,679
order these catalogs she had to go to

1552
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:43,520
the university to the astronomy

1553
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:46,880
department ohio state university and

1554
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,960
copy and copy the information

1555
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,480
from those catalogs

1556
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,119
and uh

1557
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:55,279
a lot of the astronomy departments that

1558
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:58,079
she attempted didn't even have this

1559
01:13:55,279 --> 01:14:00,479
information libraries didn't have so she

1560
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:03,119
had a difficult time getting it but

1561
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:07,279
finally a new catalog was released and

1562
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:10,960
she found a match in 1972 she completed

1563
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:13,960
her work when the last three stars were

1564
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,960
found

1565
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:19,519
and this is a photograph of one of her

1566
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,519
models

1567
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:25,359
and this is her identification

1568
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:27,039
now she was having difficulty finding

1569
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:28,639
scientists to

1570
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:30,238
better work

1571
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:33,199
for accuracy

1572
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:36,559
stan friedman was called in by coral

1573
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:38,479
lorenzen from afro and asked if he would

1574
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,520
assist marjorie in this he went to

1575
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:44,479
marjorie's house he was impressed by her

1576
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:46,800
work and by her intelligence and he

1577
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:49,678
actually did find a number of scientists

1578
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,320
who were willing to back her work and it

1579
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,119
was accurate

1580
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,759
so

1581
01:14:53,119 --> 01:15:00,079
what she found is here's zeta

1582
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:02,239
reticuli zeta 1 zeta 2. now you can see

1583
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,920
that these lines are shorter they're

1584
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:06,639
closer together

1585
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,239
than what betty actually drew the

1586
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:11,039
difference for this

1587
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:13,919
and and marjorie reasoned this out with

1588
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:16,479
the astronomers and they did accept her

1589
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,239
explanation as being reasonable is

1590
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:21,678
because betty

1591
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:24,158
observed this as a three-dimensional map

1592
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:26,640
yet she put it on paper as a

1593
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:29,599
two-dimensional map and she was looking

1594
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:32,880
at it from a certain angle and from a

1595
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:36,079
certain uh distance so when they did the

1596
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,960
math they found out that

1597
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,039
what

1598
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,640
library has here

1599
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:43,840
represented what betty described see and

1600
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,760
then through

1601
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,279
so if you're a sun

1602
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:52,159
it is now 39.

1603
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:54,880
well 39.2 it says here but i think the

1604
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:57,279
updated one is 39.3

1605
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,560
light years away from the sun

1606
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:01,840
uh zeta 1 and zeta 2 are 1 8 of a light

1607
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,640
year apart

1608
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,440
but

1609
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,560
they

1610
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:07,198
are

1611
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,840
able to support planets

1612
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:11,759
if they have plans in a stable orbit

1613
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,039
they're not so close that they wouldn't

1614
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,039
have stable orbs

1615
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:19,759
some

1616
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:22,158
all interesting facts

1617
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,880
pattern stars are sunlight stars the

1618
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:27,759
only five percent of the thousand stars

1619
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:31,520
in our local galactic neighborhood out

1620
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:34,560
54 light years are sunlight and all the

1621
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:37,920
sunlight stars in the volume of space on

1622
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:41,120
the mouth are in the pattern

1623
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:44,560
the bay stars are at least a billion

1624
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:47,119
years older than the sun and can support

1625
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,840
planets in stable orbit

1626
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:52,640
they are all on a plane like pepperoni

1627
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:55,279
on a pizza rather than like raisins in a

1628
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,679
loaf of raisin bread so it would be

1629
01:16:55,279 --> 01:17:02,759
easier to travel from one to the other

1630
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,760
instead of jumping all over the gallons

1631
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:08,880
well betty reported also that she saw a

1632
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:10,238
book on board this craft

1633
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,440
and in

1634
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:16,079
2000 the year 2000 august of 2000 i

1635
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:19,039
asked her if she could reproduce for me

1636
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:22,238
on paper the symbols in that book some

1637
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:24,719
of them she her memory had faded at that

1638
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:27,039
point she had difficulty with this this

1639
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:30,319
may not be an accurate representation of

1640
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:34,000
what she saw but she did this for me

1641
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:35,198
they were arranged uh in six columns

1642
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,158
she said the book seemed to be

1643
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:40,799
constructed of thin shiny plastic it was

1644
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:43,519
approximately an inch thick and the text

1645
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,360
was embedded in the plastic

1646
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,000
she asked the leader she could take this

1647
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:51,359
as her hope that she this experience

1648
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,158
actually occurred he initially said yes

1649
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:56,839
then that nasty little supervisor saw

1650
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:59,839
that she had it and took it away from

1651
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,920
her she

1652
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:07,319
remained behind

1653
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,319
on the crap arguing for this book

1654
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:29,359
now if you heard my lecture yesterday

1655
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:33,279
uh i told you in my comparative analysis

1656
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:35,839
i discovered that under in betty's dream

1657
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:37,519
account of what happened she said that

1658
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:41,520
the hills that she and barney were

1659
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:44,400
returned at the same time and that they

1660
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:47,199
stood outside the car and watched the

1661
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:48,799
vehicle the spacecraft leave

1662
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:52,079
that's not what they stated

1663
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:54,320
independently under hypnosis

1664
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:56,960
what they stated under hypnosis was that

1665
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:59,519
barney was returned to the car first

1666
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,158
barney stated he sat on his gun

1667
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:05,520
when he was put back into the car he

1668
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:06,639
then saw betty coming down the path his

1669
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,880
bedding

1670
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,960
he didn't report seeing the leader but

1671
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,359
then he said the leader was with her and

1672
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:16,000
then dropped her off at a certain point

1673
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:17,039
and she walked toward the car she opened

1674
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,679
the door

1675
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:23,198
she picked up the dog delcy and said

1676
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:25,440
barney let's get out and look at uh this

1677
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,279
thing leave

1678
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,719
this is even so different from betty's

1679
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:31,759
dreams that they were standing in a

1680
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:34,319
different location under hypnosis than

1681
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,159
they were in benny's dreams this leads

1682
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:39,198
me to believe that this was a real

1683
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:41,599
experience that both of them told dr

1684
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:45,839
simon about as they relived it under

1685
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:48,960
regression from a hypnotic regression

1686
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,640
well on dr simon said if this really had

1687
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:55,520
occurred they'd be able to find the

1688
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:56,320
location and they did on labor day 1965

1689
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,320
uh

1690
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,719
they did find

1691
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,880
the induction spot you can see here's

1692
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,520
route 175

1693
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,600
is melbourne road this is where the men

1694
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,880
were in the road there's a path through

1695
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:13,760
the woods the craft landed right here in

1696
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:17,359
this sandy soil area they remember the

1697
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:20,400
sandy soil and it is the only area in

1698
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:23,039
that air part of new hampshire that has

1699
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:25,198
these physical characteristics and they

1700
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:28,399
looked and looked they could never find

1701
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:30,238
a place until they were driving along

1702
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:32,879
we'd go up there

1703
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,638
and spend weekends different members of

1704
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,119
the family would go

1705
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:38,480
uh and camp out and then go look for

1706
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,399
this

1707
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:43,519
on this particular day

1708
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:46,000
arnie just seemed to remember he was

1709
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,480
driving along he made the right turns he

1710
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,840
stopped the car they got out they walked

1711
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:52,879
in the woods

1712
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,639
and found this area i was asleep in the

1713
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:58,960
back seat of the car

1714
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,960
they said oh kathy you have to see this

1715
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,480
i was too tired i didn't get up i said

1716
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:07,759
i'll see it the next time

1717
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:09,839
but as years went on i saw it dozens and

1718
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,039
dozens of times

1719
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,279
if you go there today it's impossible

1720
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:18,479
there is a housing development there the

1721
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,439
road has been paved

1722
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,079
and

1723
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:24,238
there are side roads there are houses

1724
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:26,719
everywhere it looks nothing like this

1725
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,799
but this is betty standing on the

1726
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:32,560
capture site

1727
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,440
so this is the another map of their trip

1728
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,679
home

1729
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:37,519
they heard the second series of beeps

1730
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:41,279
right here around the ashland area it

1731
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:44,159
was 37 miles to concord 17 miles from

1732
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:46,319
from northfield to concord and then 47

1733
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:50,399
miles back to portsmouth

1734
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:51,759
if they they were in thornton at 12 45

1735
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:54,559
a.m

1736
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,639
they would have arrived in ashland at

1737
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,920
about 3 30.

1738
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,480
well

1739
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,760
if they stayed on route 3 it was only 16

1740
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:05,039
miles

1741
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,679
if they turned off under 175

1742
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:10,158
it was only 21 miles

1743
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:13,119
my husband and i drove this group over

1744
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:15,519
and over again and tried to get lost we

1745
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:18,079
took every side road we could

1746
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,480
we could never get lost for more than 45

1747
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:20,479
minutes

1748
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,920
nope after the hypnosis sessions were

1749
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:29,439

1751

1771
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:18,319
executive director

1772
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:22,159

the rockingham county community action

01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,600
program that he and betty have found in

1776
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,719
the state of uh in portsmouth new

1777
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:35,039
hampshire for rockingham county so they

1778
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:38,639
were very well known around the state of

1779
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:41,198
new hampshire very politically involved

1780
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:44,239
and the worst thing that could ever

1781
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:47,039
happen to them would take

1782
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:49,279
for this information to be made public

1783
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:51,198
they'd lose their credibility

1784
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:54,719
they feared that they would probably

1785
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:57,839
lose their jobs as a result right

1786
01:23:54,719 --> 01:24:02,079
they were contacted by a newspaper

1787
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:04,159
reporter from boston in august of 1965.

1788
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:06,590
john littrell

1789
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:08,399
he had heard through gossip

1790
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:10,000
[Music]

1791
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:12,799
from a person who was supposed to

1792
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,158
maintain confidentiality who had

1793
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,719
listened to

1794
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:20,319
some of the hypnosis tapes and had

1795
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:23,000
information that she repeated to this

1796
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:26,719
newspaper report as a violation of

1797
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,719
confidentiality barney said he asked to

1798
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:31,119
meet with betty and barney because he

1799
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,960
wanted to publish this story they said

1800
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:36,800
absolutely not

1801
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:38,319
this has to remain confidential

1802
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,360
so what happened

1803
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:43,759
by october 25th

1804
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:46,238
1965 it was a regular day they got up

1805
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,440
and they went to work and all of a

1806
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:50,319
sudden

1807
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:52,879
the media was all over them

1808
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:54,639
outside their offices wanting to come

1809
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:57,440
into their offices

1810
01:24:54,639 --> 01:25:01,279
john letrell had published this on the

1811
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:03,439
front page of the boston traveler it ran

1812
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:06,079
for five days

1813
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:07,039
it was a horrible experience for my

1814
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:09,679
family

1815
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:12,079
betty and barney were panicking

1816
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:13,520
they came to my grandparents house i

1817
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:14,880
looked across the street from my

1818
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,840
grandparents

1819
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,520
we met as a family to

1820
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,920
attempt to

1821
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,880
determine what we were going to do about

1822
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,399
this

1823
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,639
and

1824
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:28,319
betty and barney at that point

1825
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:31,359
decided that

1826
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:34,799
maybe they would tell the real story

1827
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:37,119
about what happened to them uh they also

1828
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,400
spent one night with uh

1829
01:25:37,119 --> 01:25:41,519
an officer on pease air force base ben

1830
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:44,158
swett

1831
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,000
and you'll read about him in my book he

1832
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:48,559
retired as a full colonel from the

1833
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,560
pentagon

1834
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:55,560
they decided after this in early

1835
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:58,960
november november 3rd i believe it was

1836
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,840
1965 to speak publicly for the first

1837
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,399
time

1838
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:06,239
they had spoken about their experience

1839
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:07,439
to their church members at one time and

1840
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:09,519
they can't

1841
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:12,479
without being on the agenda stood up

1842
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:14,400
briefly at the two-state study group in

1843
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:19,399
quincy massachusetts

1844
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:19,399
in early november of 1963

1845
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:24,480
and talked about their signing

1846
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,880
but that was it

1847
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,479
it was done confidentially

1848
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,960
they thought

1849
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:34,718
well they did uh john 4 was at that

1850
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,520
first time that they spoke they were the

1851
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:40,960
universe the unitarian church in dover

1852
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:43,600
new hampshire spoke to a packed crowd

1853
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:46,158
the the church was filled the basement

1854
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,159
of the church was filled with people

1855
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:50,158
it was cold and rainy and there were

1856
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:52,719
people standing outside the church they

1857
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,238
had to set up speakers everywhere

1858
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,880
and

1859
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:59,119
john fuller was in the audience

1860
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,840
they were introduced by the public

1861
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,880
information officer from pease air force

1862
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,279
base

1863
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,760
and they did not talk about their

1864
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:10,158
abduction they only talked about their

1865
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:13,039
sighting

1866
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:14,638
ben swept introduced john fuller to

1867
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:16,399
betty and barney

1868
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:19,039
john 4

1869
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:21,198
talked to them about the possibility of

1870
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:23,519
writing their story in a book and

1871
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:26,799
eventually they did agree

1872
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,520
and dr simon agreed to join them

1873
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,000
and

1874
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:33,120
the interrupted journey was published in

1875
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,920
the fall of 1966

1876
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:36,238
well

1877
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,719
two of the original investigators that i

1878
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:42,399
haven't mentioned if you know the story

1879
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:45,439
at all were robert homan and c.d jackson

1880
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:47,679
they worked for ibm wrote with robert

1881
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:50,719
holman was a writer

1882
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:52,239
c.d jackson was a senior engineer

1883
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:54,319
they

1884
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:57,198
were in contact with betty and barney

1885
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:59,920
again and convinced betty to participate

1886
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:02,638
in psychophysics experiments with them

1887
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:05,199
in order to vector in the craft i have

1888
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:07,600
all of the letters that robert holman

1889
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:09,359
wrote to betty about this they went up

1890
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:12,480
they visited betting barney they went

1891
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:15,279
back to the site they actually scripted

1892
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:17,678
betty and some of this script is in the

1893
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:20,800
appendix of this book i've devoted two

1894
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,679
chapters to the experiments that they

1895
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,480
did

1896
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,480
they um

1897
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,360
were attempting to obtain hardware for

1898
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:32,079
ibm

1899
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:35,759
according to what i can gather from the

1900
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:38,399
letters that robert coleman wrote

1901
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:41,119
they were not able to do that but the

1902
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:42,799
strange thing is this experiment was

1903
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:46,319
confidential

1904
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:48,960
so when i was a teenager i wasn't aware

1905
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:52,079
of why these ufos were landing on my

1906
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,920
grandparents farm

1907
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:54,880
but i think it might have had something

1908
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,679
to do

1909
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,600
with this experiment and in fact i know

1910
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,480
that it had

1911
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,800
i

1912
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:05,439
i can't prove scientifically they landed

1913
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,600
there because of the experiment but

1914
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:09,439
there was physical trace evidence they

1915
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,679
were observed there was one i write

1916
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:13,759
about it in the book observed by a

1917
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:16,560
commercial pilot who was a neighbor of

1918
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,800
ours who saw it come in at night it woke

1919
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,600
up my grandparents as it shared up the

1920
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,119
tops of some trees it woke up my brother

1921
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,760
who was sleeping

1922
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:26,880
and the physical trace evidence was on

1923
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,560
the ground

1924
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,400
the trees

1925
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:33,760
were burned

1926
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,719
it was investigated

1927
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,920
one

1928
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:39,840
afternoon i was an amateur astronomer i

1929
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,480
was standing outside setting up my

1930
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:45,440
telescope i looked across the street

1931
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,718
over my grandparents barn and there's a

1932
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:48,479
ufo

1933
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:51,279
it was close enough that i could see the

1934
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:52,559
windows in it i was excited i'm jumping

1935
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:55,439
up and down

1936
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:57,679
ufo ufo i'm yelling my mother comes

1937
01:29:55,439 --> 01:30:00,238
running out she takes one look she grabs

1938
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:02,480
me by the arm she takes me back into the

1939
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:05,479
house and says stay away from the

1940
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:05,479
windows

1941
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:15,679
well after barney died

1942
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:16,638
the experiments with homan and jackson

1943
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:20,399
ended

1944
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:21,920
but betty continued to look for ufos in

1945
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:25,279
fact

1946
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:26,800
she was a little credulous in

1947
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:29,119
some of this she

1948
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,840
got to the point where sometimes she

1949
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:34,639
wasn't able to differentiate between

1950
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,880
conventional aircraft the ufos

1951
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:38,239
but between

1952
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,840
80 and

1953
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:44,000
95 depending upon what report you're

1954
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,039
reading the statistical analysis you're

1955
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,520
reading

1956
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:50,960
of ufo sightings are conventional

1957
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:53,120
aircraft anyway and when betty

1958
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:56,000
saw finally that they were conventional

1959
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:59,039
she identified them as conventional but

1960
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,198
what you see here is one of her better

1961
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:03,519
photographs of something i can't say

1962
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:06,079
that this is a flying saucer you can't

1963
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,239
say it's an extra terrestrial craft but

1964
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,399
i thought it was interesting because it

1965
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:14,158
is saucer-shaped she said it hovered

1966
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:17,198
over her car and in the original slide

1967
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:19,519
of this you can see someone standing

1968
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:21,119
right here in this window so i thought

1969
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:24,239
that was rather interesting there was

1970
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:26,960
another one too a fiery orb that betty

1971
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:26,959
photographed

1972
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,719
and

1973
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:34,638
this all culminated

1974
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:38,480
40 years of files uh betty's files the

1975
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:41,279
hypnosis tapes all of her memoirs went

1976
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:44,079
in to this book and culminated and

1977
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:47,439
captured the betty and barney hill ufo

1978
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:49,198
experience with by stanton freeman and

1979
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:50,319
myself

1980
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:53,119
and

1981
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:54,779
i want to thank you very much for coming

1982
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:57,599
today

1983
01:31:54,779 --> 01:31:59,198
[Music]

1984
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,840
the story has

1985
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:03,519
been being told for some time since the

1986
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,920
late 60s

1987
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:08,239
it's not a new story

1988
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,480
we have done a lot of research that puts

1989
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:13,198
information out that hasn't been put out

1990
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:16,238
before the new book captured

1991
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:17,279
but it's an important story

1992
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:19,678
for

1993
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:21,599
on several different levels

1994
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,760
there's a first abduction experience to

1995
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,360
get any serious attention wasn't the

1996
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:28,079
first abduction

1997
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:29,839
first when they get attention

1998
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:31,279
and john fuller's book the interrupted

1999
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,360
journey

2000
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:35,119
now

2001
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:37,439
it got attention in spite of the efforts

2002
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:40,079
of betty and barney

2003
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:42,158
because they were very much concerned

2004
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:44,238
about what the impact would be on their

2005
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:47,759
lives

2006
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:50,079
if this story got out

2007
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,760
betty was a social worker

2008
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:53,679
a supervisor in the welfare department

2009
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,920
state of new hampshire

2010
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:59,520
barney worked for the post office was

2011
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:02,880
very active in civil rights

2012
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:05,360
uh the last thing they needed

2013
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,760
was public attention about the strangest

2014
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:09,759
story you can imagine

2015
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,639
bad enough to see a flying saucer people

2016
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:14,400
have been seeing them for years

2017
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:16,239
many years

2018
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:19,198
even seeing crash flying saucers as you

2019
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:21,599
heard in the previous talk

2020
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:23,759
but now we're not talking about

2021
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,120
dead bodies we're talking about live

2022
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,960
ones

2023
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:28,960
we're not talking about wreckage we're

2024
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:31,359
talking about a craft that comes down

2025
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:34,880
does its thing and leaves

2026
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:38,238
takes them on board against their will

2027
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:40,639
this is a crazy story

2028
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:42,879
so they made every effort to keep the

2029
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:45,039
story from getting out in the public

2030
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,880
because they were honestly and sincerely

2031
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:50,079
concerned about what it would mean to

2032
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,900
their lives

2033
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:52,399
their jobs

2034
01:33:50,899 --> 01:33:53,920
[Music]

2035
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:57,039
as you may have noticed this is an

2036
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,039
interracial couple

2037
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:05,639
this is 1961 in new hampshire

2038
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:05,639
such couples were not very common

2039
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:10,399
very special people

2040
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,159
and i surprised some people by pointing

2041
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:13,158
out that even though you noticed barney

2042
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:15,920
died in

2043
01:34:13,158 --> 01:34:17,519
1969 february

2044
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:20,000

2045
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,679

in 1968 november

2048
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:28,879
and it was it was interesting because i

2049
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:31,120
got a call from

2050
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:34,480

2066
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:11,519
where i was living and working for

2067
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,119
westinghouse

2068
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,800
and one of them was a producer of this

2069
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:17,839
show contact

2070
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,600
and i called them and gave them a spiel

2071
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,800
and usually being a nuclear physicist

2072
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:24,400
working for westinghouse were

2073
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,679
gold-plated credentials in pittsburgh

2074
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:27,359
you know you want to buy a house how

2075
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,719
much do you want to borrow that kind of

2076
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,279
thing

2077
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:34,000
but their response was pretty much don't

2078
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:35,920
call us we'll call you

2079
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,039
well less than a month later they called

2080
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:42,560
me at 6 30 at night could i please be on

2081
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:44,399
their show at seven o'clock

2082
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,840
somebody had canceled at the last minute

2083
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:47,679
and lord knows how many people they

2084
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,639
called before they got somebody like me

2085
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:52,880
who was willing to go on the show

2086
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:55,279
so i did the show

2087
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,840
i wasn't as good at handling the noisy

2088
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:59,599
negative as then as i am now

2089
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:01,279
but somebody at work at westinghouse

2090
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:03,199
heard me asked me to talk to her book

2091
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:04,880
review club which was looking at frank's

2092
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:06,559
book i gave my first lecture in her

2093
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,480
living room

2094
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:10,719
i did the show many times over the next

2095
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:12,559
couple of years

2096
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:14,560
and

2097
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:17,840
finally

2098
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:19,600
after i'd done several shows for them

2099
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:23,279
i got a call

2100
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:25,600
betty and barney hill are coming to town

2101
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:28,559
we thought you might like to know

2102
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:30,480
now normally stations won't do that

2103
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:32,080
they protect their guests

2104
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:33,759
so they called me told me what hotel

2105
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:36,158
they were staying at

2106
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:37,520
i called them went down we had dinner

2107
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:40,238
together

2108
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,920
i was very favorably impressed by that i

2109
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:44,718
mean i'd read the look magazine article

2110
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:47,199
in john fuller's book and so forth

2111
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,800
so i can truthfully say i had a chance

2112
01:36:47,198 --> 01:36:52,479
to interact with the both of them i've

2113
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:54,480
seen betty many times since

2114
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:56,479
at her home we did television shows at

2115
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:59,198
tomorrow show

2116
01:36:56,479 --> 01:37:00,959
other shows

2117
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:03,118
my movie ufos are real there's some

2118
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,840
copies outside

2119
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:07,359
interview done at betty's

2120
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:08,880
house so

2121
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:11,198
a very special

2122
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:13,920
twosome here

2123
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:15,759
and if you look at the dates

2124
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:17,600
you'll see betty lived a much longer

2125
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,000
time than barney

2126
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,960
so these are the protagonists in this

2127
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,479
interesting story

2128
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,480
but

2129
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:29,118
people with excellent reputations in

2130
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:31,599
their community who did not seek out

2131
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:34,319
publicity talk to a lawyer about keeping

2132
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,000
the story from coming out he said

2133
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:37,519
there's nothing you can do

2134
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,960
the reporter got a hold of it who wanted

2135
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,920
to interview them

2136
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,760
from a

2137
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,760
boston newspaper and it was the last

2138
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,600
thing they wanted but

2139
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,119
you want to interview dr simon the

2140
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,600
psychiatrist

2141
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:50,319
he wasn't having any either

2142
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,639
so

2143
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:53,759
it's an interesting saga this was second

2144
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,639
marriages

2145
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,159
well

2146
01:37:54,639 --> 01:38:00,880
they both have been married before

2147
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:03,839
and a very special couple let's look at

2148
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,840
the next slide

2149
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:09,039
and another character in this drama was

2150
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:10,479
stelsi their dog who was with them on

2151
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:12,479
the trip

2152
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:14,479
and whose behavior indicated great

2153
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:16,799
concern at some time hiding under the

2154
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:18,238
seat as i recall it

2155
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,840
uh

2156
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:21,919
but she's not the little critter we want

2157
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:25,360
to talk about the most tonight

2158
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,359
let's look at the next slide

2159
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,158
uh

2160
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:31,039
now

2161
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:32,479
you'll hear all kinds of crazy stories

2162
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:36,238
one of the things about important

2163
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:39,359
stories like roswell and the hill case

2164
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:41,678
is that the nasty noisy negativists

2165
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:44,559
really work overtime

2166
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:48,079
trying to put out garbage

2167
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:49,440
and you'll see every aspect of each case

2168
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:50,800
being attacked by somebody who doesn't

2169
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:52,719
know what he's talking about or if he

2170
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,960
does is intentionally lying and i'm not

2171
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:57,439
going to pass judgment on that

2172
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,359
you know why they went on a trip betty

2173
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:01,039
had a week's vacation coming barney

2174
01:38:59,359 --> 01:39:03,759
wanted to do something they were fairly

2175
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:06,319
newly married

2176
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:09,520
celebrating a special way

2177
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:12,479
betty had never been to niagara falls

2178
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:14,000
barney got time off from work well she

2179
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:17,439
had a vacation

2180
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,840
and they decided to go to niagara falls

2181
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:23,759
everybody's romantic objective if you

2182
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,760
this is sort of like a honeymoon forum

2183
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:29,760
and you may not recognize this person

2184
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:31,920
but she's standing right here

2185
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,199
this is kathleen

2186
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,920
and

2187
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:35,919
at the time

2188
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,479
she was 13 years old

2189
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:41,839
should i say that yeah you're not

2190
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:43,759
supposed to tell a woman's age but

2191
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:44,800
that's right this was a girl's age was

2192
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,920
13.

2193
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,039
she had been at niagara falls

2194
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,199
uh

2195
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:52,479
and so she had told them about her her

2196
01:39:51,198 --> 01:39:54,399
trip

2197
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:56,079
and that helped them understand you know

2198
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:58,079
why it was worth going

2199
01:39:56,079 --> 01:40:00,319
there and so forth

2200
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:00,319
uh

2201
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:03,359
the

2202
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:09,840
objective here is to drive to niagara

2203
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:09,839
falls come back through montreal

2204
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,639
come on back home they'd have a great

2205
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:14,638
weekend

2206
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:20,719
you know a break in the activities

2207
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:22,079
but kathy was around at the time and

2208
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,760
there are some people who will tell you

2209
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:25,920
she was only three years old at the time

2210
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,840
how did she know what was going on they

2211
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,359
left off that little one 13 and three

2212
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:32,319
are not the same in case you hadn't

2213
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:34,839
noticed excellent

2214
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:37,359
so they were following a

2215
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,560
route they'd gone over to niagara falls

2216
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:40,960
which is

2217
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,719
from thousand islands

2218
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,880
they came up through montreal had a

2219
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:47,920
great time in montreal

2220
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,920
and headed east

2221
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:54,000
from montreal to koatikook

2222
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,119
i got it i think i pronounced it

2223
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,479
properly

2224
01:40:55,118 --> 01:40:58,479
close enough

2225
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:00,079
down through colebrook there's a border

2226
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:00,879
between canada and the united states

2227
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:03,198
here

2228
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,118
this is lovely farmland dairy farms i've

2229
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:07,279
been on that road

2230
01:41:05,118 --> 01:41:09,759
uh a rural area

2231
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:12,479
montreal isn't rural believe me

2232
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:14,480
the countryside is

2233
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,238
and things were going as one might

2234
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:18,000
expect them to go they thought they

2235
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:18,959
might stay over in montreal barney got

2236
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,479
lost

2237
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,480
all the signs were in french and he

2238
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:24,000
didn't speak french

2239
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:25,839
and so after they got through the town

2240
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,679
they decided oh what the heck he felt he

2241
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,719
was feeling great he we could drive on

2242
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:30,639
home to

2243
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:32,639
portsmouth new hampshire

2244
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:34,719
these are not busy roads

2245
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,880
once you get past montreal

2246
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:38,560
it was that night he was accustomed to

2247
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:41,440
working at night

2248
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:43,760
uh so away we go

2249
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:46,319
next one

2250
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,719
here's quite a cook and it's kathleen's

2251
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:51,279
turn to say something

2252
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:54,560
betty and barney stopped for dinner in

2253
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:57,279
koat cook they decided to use up the

2254
01:41:54,560 --> 01:42:01,119
remainder of their canadian money

2255
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:03,118
and you might have heard that barney was

2256
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:05,920
very upset

2257
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:08,559
during this trip because he had

2258
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,560
encountered some hoodlums who gave him a

2259
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,239
rough time about being married to a

2260
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,679
white woman

2261
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:18,158
that is false what actually happened

2262
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:20,319
is that betty and barney went into a

2263
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:23,198
restaurant there were two young men in

2264
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:27,039
there who had what barney described as

2265
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:29,439
duck bill haircuts and it reminded him

2266
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:30,479
of the haircuts that hoodum types were

2267
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:32,399
wearing

2268
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:33,279
at that time frame

2269
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,519
but

2270
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:37,599
they were conventionally dressed and

2271
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,800
barney stated that they were very nice

2272
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,280
young men

2273
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:44,239
they had a nice dinner in the restaurant

2274
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:44,238
and then they left

2275
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,639
after they left

2276
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:51,519
they traveled

2277
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:54,079
through the canadian countryside toward

2278
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:56,800
vermont and then on to new hampshire

2279
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:59,039
this is one of the attractive farms that

2280
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:02,400
they passed along the way

2281
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:06,479
and during the hypnosis during this time

2282
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:09,439
frame dr simon was asking barney how he

2283
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:12,479
felt what his emotional state was and i

2284
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:17,399
want to play for you now barney in

2285
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:17,399
barney's own words how he felt

2286
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:22,760
[Applause]

2287
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:48,159
i hope that you could hear that it was

2288
01:43:45,198 --> 01:43:50,399
he what he uh stated is written up there

2289
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:50,399
on the

2290
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:57,279
screen well then they drove on and they

2291
01:43:54,158 --> 01:44:01,118
passed through customs and canaan

2292
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:01,118
vermont without any problems

2293
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:07,840
and this is the route that they took

2294
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:10,239
here's colebrook this would have been

2295
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:12,719
their first stop after they left canada

2296
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:15,839
they got gasoline there and stopped at a

2297
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:18,560
restaurant again for a cup of coffee

2298
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:22,079
then they went on to lancaster the next

2299
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:24,320
city down along route 3 the major route

2300
01:44:22,079 --> 01:44:26,719
that ran through northern new hampshire

2301
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:28,639
it still is the only major route in that

2302
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:32,480
part of northern new hampshire

2303
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:32,480
and then on to twin mountain

2304
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:37,519
this is the town of colebrook

2305
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:39,599
they stopped at a restaurant their

2306
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,560
howard's restaurant

2307
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,560
and

2308
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,719
just had a cup of coffee they knew it

2309
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,119
was the last opportunity they'd have

2310
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:50,639
probably to have a cup of coffee that

2311
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:52,960
night before they went home

2312
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:56,000
and as they were leaving the restaurant

2313
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,840
they noticed it was about 10 o'clock

2314
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,359
p.m

2315

they drove along to lancaster now you

2319
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,920

2320

and you think oh it's pretty busy

2321
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:14,158

2327
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:26,479
no traffic

2328

2329
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:30,799
commercial nature any place along this

2330
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:33,198
route it's country

2331
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:35,520
pure and simple country

2332
01:45:33,198 --> 01:45:38,799

2335
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:46,719
the driving south

2336
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,638
betty on the right in the passenger seat

2337
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:50,960
of course

2338
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,039
saw a strange new light in the sky she

2339
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,719
was watching the sky the skies are clear

2340
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,359
and beautiful down there this is not

2341

smogsville country at all and as you'll

2342
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:02,399
see the weather was great

2343
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:04,239
and they saw this new light in the sky

2344
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:06,319
except it was sort of like a meteor

2345
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:08,718
except it was going up

2346
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:11,039
next slide they were going from north to

2347
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:13,760
south as you can see there

2348
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:15,840
okay this

2349
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:17,280
the first interview that was done at any

2350
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,960
length with them

2351
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:20,880
after they made an initial report to

2352
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,000
peace at the local police and peace air

2353
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:24,560
force base

2354
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,639
was done by walter webb

2355
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,679
he was a wheel at the planetarium in

2356
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:28,960
boston

2357
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:30,158
the lecturer

2358
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,079
when he finished i guess he was

2359
01:46:30,158 --> 01:46:33,039
assistant directors

2360
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:34,960
uh

2361
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:36,399
he was an investigator for the national

2362
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,319
investigations committee on aerial

2363
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:41,679
phenomena nightcap one of the two major

2364
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:43,118
groups at that time apro and nikop very

2365
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:44,560
phenomenal research organization

2366
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:46,719
national investigations committee on

2367
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:49,119
aerial phenomena

2368
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:51,359
now after the event we'll be talking

2369
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:53,679
about uh betty went to the library got a

2370
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,599
book out by major donald kehoe who had

2371
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,118
pretty much founded nightcap and was

2372
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,960
director

2373
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:00,559
and it had an address to which you could

2374
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,600
write to report a sighting and they

2375
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:06,960
requested that sightings be reported

2376
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:08,079
and so she wrote a letter

2377
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,319
uh

2378
01:47:08,079 --> 01:47:12,000
detailing what happened during this

2379
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:14,158
experience as far as she knew at the

2380
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,399
time anyway

2381
01:47:14,158 --> 01:47:19,439
and they in turn passed this on to

2382
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:20,719
walter webb nycap was in washington dc

2383
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:24,238
we're talking about

2384
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:25,920
new hampshire nearest big city boston of

2385
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:27,359
course

2386
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:30,319
walter webb was

2387
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:32,479
their big shot investigator in boston

2388
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:34,639
they passed betty's letter

2389
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:36,718
naturally typed she was a social worker

2390
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:38,880
she was a supervisor welfare department

2391
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:42,560
of new state of new hampshire he was

2392
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,560
accustomed to writing reports

2393
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:46,000
uh

2394
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,840
and it was detailed

2395
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,439
so walter called them

2396
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:51,360
within a couple of days after getting

2397
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:53,839
the letter from nycap

2398
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:56,399
and arranged to meet them

2399
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,560
and so we have a copy of that report

2400
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:01,439
he's still around incidentally

2401
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:03,119
little older as most of us are now

2402
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:04,719
and there's a quote here the couple

2403
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:06,559
initially thought they were observing a

2404
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:11,039
falling star only it moved upward a

2405
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,039
plane or a satellite next slide

2406
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:14,319
uh

2407
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:17,198
there were bright

2408
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:21,039
you can see that up there the first stop

2409
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:23,679
was near twin mountain now

2410
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:26,000
now we're getting up to 11 20 p.m even

2411
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:30,158
quieter

2412
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:32,960
nothing going on peaceful countryside

2413
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:34,479
no hoodlums

2414
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,158
there were bright colors like bright

2415
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:38,399
orange light almost a reddish beam and

2416
01:48:36,158 --> 01:48:39,599
there were like a blue light on a police

2417
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:41,679
cruiser

2418
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:44,159
they were just a flash flash of

2419
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:45,840
different colors

2420
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:48,158
and i'd never seen anything like it

2421
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:50,560
before it was moving quite fast

2422
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:52,238
now she's watching barney's driving

2423
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,760
when i saw it go in front of the moon i

2424
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,158
was sort of fascinated and i kept

2425
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,079
watching now note that

2426
01:48:56,158 --> 01:48:59,599
a later explanation is that this was

2427
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:01,840
jupiter

2428
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:05,360
now i can't remember the last time

2429
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:07,920
jupiter went in front of the moon

2430
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:10,079
it's half a billion miles out there

2431
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,840
the moon's a quarter of a million miles

2432
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:14,719
out there

2433
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:16,239
but let's look at the next sign

2434
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:18,719
she was intrigued in other words and

2435
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:20,638
she's telling barney incidentally

2436
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:23,118
about this

2437
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:24,880
she's seeing a ufo and he's betty there

2438
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,719
are no ufos

2439
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,319
he was poo pooing and he was driving

2440
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:30,000
south she's watching this thing and

2441
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,158
reporting to him

2442
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,359
they went through franconia notch which

2443
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,879
is now we say mountains in new hampshire

2444
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:40,079
when you're on the east coast and you

2445
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:41,359
say mountains you don't mean the rockies

2446
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:43,279
the highest point east of the

2447
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:45,039
mississippi is in new hampshire mount

2448
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:45,920
washington or one of the highest points

2449
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:47,679
to

2450
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,319
gather with north carolina

2451
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:52,960
but you do have rolling country

2452
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:54,960
and some sharp hills so you get this

2453
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,480
franconian notch they call it you can

2454
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:58,079
see why

2455
01:49:56,479 --> 01:49:59,118
it's sharp

2456
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:02,960
notch

2457
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:05,198
not slowly rolling down kind of thing

2458
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,960
uh this was taken a little later time in

2459
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:09,198
the year and they get gorgeous color up

2460
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:10,560
there but normally in october

2461
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:12,319
not september and then you'll have

2462
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:13,760
busloads full of tourists looking at the

2463
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:15,039
color

2464
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:18,639
but not

2465
01:50:15,039 --> 01:50:18,639
september 20th next slide

2466
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:24,960
then we see cannon mountain there is a

2467
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:26,319
well you can you can see it there

2468
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,840
there's a

2469
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:30,158
a tramway

2470
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,279
you know it goes up and down runs most

2471
01:50:30,158 --> 01:50:33,759
of the year

2472
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:35,599
ski lift if you want to call it that not

2473
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,360
at this time of year of course

2474
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:39,760
they do have skiing there

2475
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:43,198
no it's a beautiful local area well

2476
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:45,199
known and some people have suggested

2477
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:47,118
that what they saw was the light at the

2478
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:48,399
top of the mountain there

2479
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:50,238
and as you will hear about all the

2480
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:52,399
things this crazy light did you realize

2481
01:50:50,238 --> 01:50:53,919
it couldn't have been

2482
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:55,598
that lights at top of the mountain stay

2483
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,440
in the same place normally they don't

2484
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:59,679
move around they don't fly in front of

2485
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:03,118
the moon and you know

2486
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:03,118
so let's look at the next slide

2487
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,840
is that yours

2488
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:09,118
uh

2489
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,400
now

2490
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:14,399
i get a real kick out of the

2491
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:15,359
explanations about point sources jupiter

2492
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:18,158
uh

2493
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:19,279
they also watched it go past one of the

2494
01:51:18,158 --> 01:51:21,198
real

2495
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:23,599
emblems of new hampshire the old man of

2496
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:24,719
the mountain until it fell

2497
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:26,880
uh

2498
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:29,198
when we went by where it was we were up

2499
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:30,960
there doing a television show but

2500
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:33,359
this shape

2501
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:34,960
as you can see first seen in 1805 by a

2502
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:36,319
white man looks like an old man of the

2503
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,960
mountain

2504
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:41,279
they saw the ufo

2505
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:43,279
alongside it

2506
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:45,759
now it's 48 feet from

2507
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:48,559
chin to brow

2508
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:50,960
it was about one and a half times

2509
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,960
the height

2510
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,279
that's not a point of light in other

2511
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:55,279
words

2512
01:51:56,399 --> 01:51:59,920
yeah i better show you up here

2513
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:02,079
you see the idea here's the old man of

2514
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,599
the mountain this now fell into a lake

2515
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:06,399
and you can't see it but

2516
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:08,159
the saucer was next to it

2517
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:10,238
uh

2518
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:11,759
but

2519
01:52:10,238 --> 01:52:15,039
people want to explain it away and

2520
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:16,880
ignore this part of the testimony

2521
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:19,760
if it was 48 feet one and a half times

2522
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:22,639
would be 72 feet

2523
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:24,000
that's hardly a point source of light

2524
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:27,440
and so many of the so-called

2525
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,439
explanations disappear

2526
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,599
okay

2527
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:36,319
they then made a second stop and got out

2528
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:37,440
of the car to look at this object in the

2529
01:52:36,319 --> 01:52:39,679
sky

2530
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:42,559
betty had told barney that it was moving

2531
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,800
erratically and they both speculated

2532
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,840
that perhaps it was the movement of the

2533
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,840
car

2534
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:50,880
and betty was looking at this through

2535
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:53,840
binoculars as she was riding along

2536
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:56,159
and so they decided to stop

2537
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:59,520
to see if it actually was moving

2538
01:52:56,158 --> 01:53:02,000
erratically or if it was only an object

2539
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:04,960
that was moving smoothly in the sky

2540
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:09,880
and so i want to play for you now

2541
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:09,880
barney's description of what they saw

2542
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:26,198
about

2543
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:31,039
a thousand feet i guess

2544
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:34,718
i

2545
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:40,560
i

2546
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:43,359
know it is not a pepper cup

2547
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:45,920
it was too fast

2548
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:47,198
it moved too fast

2549
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:48,480
it would go

2550
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:50,719
up and

2551
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:50,718
down

2552
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,920
it couldn't go back so fast

2553
01:53:55,118 --> 01:54:01,598
it could go away and come back

2554
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,599
go toward the west

2555
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:06,480
and without

2556
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:11,440
looking as if it turned it would come

2557
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:11,439
straight back it would go like a

2558
01:54:12,238 --> 01:54:14,479
uh

2559
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:21,359
i think of a pedal

2560
01:54:18,158 --> 01:54:21,359
and a ball with a

2561
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:24,159
you rubber

2562
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,479
the ball

2563
01:54:24,158 --> 01:54:28,799
and the ball goes straight out and comes

2564
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:31,198
straight back

2565
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:34,320
without a circle

2566
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:37,319
and i think only a jet could fly that

2567
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:37,319
fast

2568
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,840
so he thinks only a jet could fly that

2569
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:46,079
fast the only problem is it was

2570
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,039
completely silent

2571
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:51,279
and it had unconventional lighting

2572
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:54,238
and they could see the windows in it

2573
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:57,439
there were no red lights at that time

2574
01:54:54,238 --> 01:55:01,598
there was only a row of white lights and

2575
01:54:57,439 --> 01:55:01,598
it appeared to be rotating

2576
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:08,719
whoops here we go

2577
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,639
they then returned to their car

2578
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:12,719
and drove south

2579
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:15,679
the next area that they would have come

2580
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:17,679
to is known as indian head this is the

2581
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:20,319
area where the

2582
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:22,000
spend the night there were cottages

2583
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:24,000
there at the time and there were also

2584
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,479
some tourist attractions

2585
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,679
what you see here is indian head

2586
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:34,000
the indian head resort is there

2587
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:38,158
in 1961 there were only cabins today it

2588
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:40,719
has grown into a big beautiful resort

2589
01:55:38,158 --> 01:55:44,158
and i did want to mention that in

2590
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:47,439
september of 2011

2591
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:50,079
the indian head resort is going to host

2592
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:52,479
a 50th anniversary event

2593
01:55:50,079 --> 01:55:55,439
uh to commemorate betty and barney

2594
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:58,879
hill's experience and they are going to

2595
01:55:55,439 --> 01:56:01,759
dedicate a memorial to betty and barney

2596
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:04,480
and there will be guided tours of the

2597
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:07,679
close encounter route i will be giving

2598
01:56:04,479 --> 01:56:10,879
those and also lecturing so i hope that

2599
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:14,158
you will consider coming to that

2600
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:17,199
as betty and barney pass those cabins

2601
01:56:14,158 --> 01:56:19,198
betty saw someone standing in one of the

2602
01:56:17,198 --> 01:56:22,960
windows it was a man standing in a

2603
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:25,839
window and she thought to herself well

2604
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:28,158
i could end all of this right now

2605
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,679
if we just stopped and spent the night

2606
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:33,118
at this cabin

2607
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:35,920
but then she thought she was so curious

2608
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:39,118
she wanted to see more of this

2609
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:43,760
and barney having left this very

2610
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:45,839
desolate area told dr simon and i quote

2611
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:48,560
i feel safe and less in the barren

2612
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:52,000
hostility of the wooded area i've been

2613
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:54,719
here before and i feel comforted that i

2614
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:58,319
see a familiar place

2615
01:56:54,719 --> 01:57:00,880
now barney started to talk to dr simon

2616
01:56:58,319 --> 01:57:04,719
about betty's reaction

2617
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:07,679
dr simon had asked him and he said betty

2618
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:11,359
is becoming excited about this thing

2619
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:12,639
and betty rarely becomes excited about

2620
01:57:11,359 --> 01:57:15,839
anything

2621
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:17,279
so something is going on here that is

2622
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:20,319
unusual

2623
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:22,800
and i think that i want to stop and get

2624
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:24,960
a better look at this thing

2625
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:27,360
so as he was driving himself he was

2626
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,439
looking for another place where he could

2627
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:30,639
pull over to the side of the road and

2628
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:31,439
stop

2629
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:34,800
but

2630
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:35,759
before he had the opportunity to find a

2631
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,119
spot

2632
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:41,520
this craft shifted ahead of them

2633
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:44,960
and stopped directly over the top of

2634
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:48,000
their vehicle and then descended toward

2635
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:53,560
them causing barney to have to stop the

2636
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,560
car directly in the middle of the road

2637
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:59,760
now we're at 12 15 a.m now he stopped in

2638
01:57:58,238 --> 01:58:01,678
the middle of the road and you might

2639
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,360
think well that was not a very bright

2640
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:04,840
thing to do but there was nobody around

2641
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:07,359
there was no

2642
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:10,319
traffic he says it continued to have a

2643
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:12,880
forward look facing me as if it swung

2644
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:15,198
and did not move from its position

2645
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:16,800
but just swung around with the front

2646
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:19,198
still facing me

2647
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,279
and it moved to my left and i continued

2648
01:58:19,198 --> 01:58:23,439
to look and began walking across the

2649
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:25,759
highway

2650
01:58:23,439 --> 01:58:27,598
from the car got out of the car

2651
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:29,119
going across the highway there's a field

2652
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:32,119
over there

2653
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:32,118
and

2654
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:39,599
okay

2655
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:41,520
barney

2656
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:43,920
walked toward the craft holding the

2657
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:46,480
binoculars up to his eyes

2658
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,880
and what i want to do now is to play for

2659
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:51,519
you two tape recordings of barney's

2660
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:54,880
statements about what he saw the first

2661
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,840
recording is his first session with dr

2662
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:59,359
simon

2663
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:02,639
and dr simon uh brought on this

2664
01:58:59,359 --> 01:59:04,319
tremendous release of emotion in barney

2665
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:06,960
at this point

2666
01:59:04,319 --> 01:59:10,559
this is the place where barney's mental

2667
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:13,198
block set in he recalled

2668
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:17,119
the a close encounter with this craft he

2669
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:20,238
recalled observing non-human entities on

2670
01:59:17,118 --> 01:59:23,759
board the craft in fact his statement to

2671
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:27,359
walter webb in the initial report was

2672
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:30,800
that they were somehow not human

2673
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:32,880
in betty's letter written september 25th

2674
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,320
1961

2675
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:37,039
to nycap

2676
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:39,840
she reported that barney had observed

2677
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:42,238
figures on board this craft and there

2678
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:44,639
was something about their appearance

2679
01:59:42,238 --> 01:59:46,959
that had frightened him so badly that he

2680
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:49,199
had developed a mental block and would

2681
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,920
they were considering finding a

2682
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:54,879
competent psychiatrist who would use

2683
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:57,118
hypnosis to help barney

2684
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:58,400
understand what it was that caused this

2685
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:00,719
mental block

leader because

2721
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:05,520
everybody moved

2722
02:02:03,118 --> 02:02:06,799
everyone was standing there looking at

2723
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:09,040
me

2724
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:11,520
but everybody moved

2725
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:13,279
to these levers or in the back or they

2726
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:14,080
went to this

2727
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:16,238
big

2728
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:17,380
board they looked like it looked like a

2729
02:02:16,238 --> 02:02:18,559
board

2730
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:21,679
[Music]

2731
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:24,800
and only this one with the black

2732
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:27,279
black shiny jacket

2733
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:31,000
in the scarf

2734
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:31,000
stayed at the window

2735
02:02:34,158 --> 02:02:37,920
there's some real terror there you might

2736
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,479
have noticed

2737
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:43,599
now i'm going to play the excerpt from

2738
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:46,479
the second hypnosis session where barney

2739
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:50,159
was reliving the same experience with

2740
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:52,479
left's emotion and was able to give dr

2741
02:02:50,158 --> 02:02:55,479
simon a little more detail about what he

2742
02:02:52,479 --> 02:02:55,479
observed

2743
02:03:00,319 --> 02:03:04,880
i noticed with my binoculars that there

2744
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:06,800
were

2745
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:07,840
about 11 men

2746
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,960
now

2747
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,880
i thought

2748
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:13,359
looking down at me

2749
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:17,279
and they suddenly made a

2750
02:03:13,359 --> 02:03:20,639
turn to what i thought was a panel

2751
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:23,840
and i could see their arms going up

2752
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:24,639
and there was one that kept looking down

2753
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,719
and

2754
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:27,599
i kept going closer

2755
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:31,599
and

2756
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:33,119
i could see two red lights coming out

2757
02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:35,760
from the tip

2758
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:38,960
of this thing that did not look like a

2759
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:39,920
plane at all or a helicopter

2760
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:41,439
and

2761
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,960
i could see

2762
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:46,079
a long something coming down from the

2763
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,880
center

2764
02:03:46,079 --> 02:03:50,238
and

2765
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:52,159
i kept going closer and closer

2766
02:03:50,238 --> 02:03:54,078
and i thought oh my god

2767
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:54,879
what is this thing

2768
02:03:54,078 --> 02:04:00,158
and

2769
02:03:54,880 --> 02:04:03,760
i felt myself being told to come closer

2770
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:07,279
and i was greatly confused and i blinked

2771
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:10,400
my eyes and i thought this can't be real

2772
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:13,198
and i shook my head and turned it away

2773
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:16,158
and looked back and i thought oh god

2774
02:04:13,198 --> 02:04:18,879
it's there what is this thing and i put

2775
02:04:16,158 --> 02:04:21,118
my hand toward my gun and i could not

2776
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:23,840
put my hand there and i could not

2777
02:04:21,118 --> 02:04:26,799
understand why my hands kept going up

2778
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:29,199
with the binoculars and i was told to

2779
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:31,920
keep the binoculars up and keep looking

2780
02:04:29,198 --> 02:04:34,879
up and keep coming closer no harm would

2781
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:37,440
come to me and that's when i opened my

2782
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,840
hands and the binoculars fell around my

2783
02:04:37,439 --> 02:04:41,919
neck and i ran

2784
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:44,239
screaming back to the car

2785
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:46,719
that they were going to capture us and

2786
02:04:44,238 --> 02:04:49,919
yet i could not understand what they

2787
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:52,880
wanted to capture us for and i thought i

2788
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:56,399
should report this to the police if ever

2789
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:59,279
i could find a call box or anything or a

2790
02:04:56,399 --> 02:05:02,158
restaurant open because this was very

2791
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:05,118
unusual for something to do that and i

2792
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:07,759
thought of the military and i thought

2793
02:05:05,118 --> 02:05:10,000
since they had on black jack the one

2794
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:13,199
looking at me had on a black jacket he

2795
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:16,158
must have been a military officer and

2796
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:18,399
yet i could not quite understand why

2797
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:20,638
they were doing what they were doing and

2798
02:05:18,399 --> 02:05:22,879
there was no sound coming from this

2799
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:25,199
thing

2800
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:28,239
barney then finally managed to pull

2801
02:05:25,198 --> 02:05:31,678
those binoculars down and when he

2802
02:05:28,238 --> 02:05:34,479
arrived home the strap the leather strap

2803
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:38,000
on the binoculars was broken

2804
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:40,638
and this must have been the point where

2805
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,880
he broke that strap where he pulled them

2806
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:46,639
down so violently

2807
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:49,359
in order to overcome this this thought

2808
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:52,400
that he was getting from the leader on

2809
02:05:49,359 --> 02:05:54,799
this craft to keep them up at his eyes

2810
02:05:52,399 --> 02:05:55,920
uh he pulled it down and ran back to the

2811
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:57,760
car

2812
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,599
screaming to betty that they had to get

2813
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:02,239
out of there they were going to be

2814
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:05,599
captured betty was seated in the car all

2815
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:07,678
of this time the door was cracked open i

2816
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:09,360
imagine the interior light in the car

2817
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:12,319
was on

2818
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:13,439
and she was calling for barney after a

2819
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:15,840
few minutes

2820
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:18,000
and when he didn't come back she was

2821
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:20,000
becoming very upset

2822
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,479
and she

2823
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,880
felt that if he hadn't come back when he

2824
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:27,919
did she was going to get out of the car

2825
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:30,078
and go into that field and look for him

2826
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:32,319
as barney was returning to the car

2827
02:06:30,078 --> 02:06:37,279
running back he noticed that the craft

2828
02:06:32,319 --> 02:06:39,519
had shifted overhead above the vehicle

2829
02:06:37,279 --> 02:06:39,519
whoa

2830
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:46,158
and

2831
02:06:44,399 --> 02:06:48,158
he told betty to

2832
02:06:46,158 --> 02:06:50,960
look up and see if she could see the

2833
02:06:48,158 --> 02:06:52,238
craft so she rolled down the window and

2834
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,480
she looked up

2835
02:06:52,238 --> 02:06:56,638
and she couldn't see it

2836
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:58,479
all she could see is blackness she

2837
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:00,480
couldn't see the stars

2838
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:02,879
she couldn't see the sky

2839
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:05,279
she saw her only blackness and i'm going

2840
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:07,599
to play for you now her description of

2841
02:07:05,279 --> 02:07:10,399
what happened next

2842
02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:13,800
she's inside the car looking up

2843
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:13,799
out the window

2844
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:23,118
no even buddy said

2845
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:24,158
what's happened yeah what's that noise

2846
02:07:23,118 --> 02:07:27,439
and i said

2847
02:07:24,158 --> 02:07:30,479
i don't know it sounds all i could think

2848
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:32,960
of with some kind of electrical signal

2849
02:07:30,479 --> 02:07:34,799
somebody's you know it's really big and

2850
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:36,800
i thought well i wonder why did i learn

2851
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:38,719
the most code because maybe this is the

2852
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:42,159
mouse code and i don't know it

2853
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:44,560
and i thought well maybe it's electrical

2854
02:07:42,158 --> 02:07:47,739
it's the shock get it you know i could

2855
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:49,360
so i put my hand on the metal of the car

2856
02:07:47,739 --> 02:07:51,118
[Applause]

2857
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:53,839
and i kept feeling the feeling and i

2858
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:54,639
didn't feel any uh shock no electric

2859
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:58,800
shack

2860
02:07:54,639 --> 02:08:01,440
but the hotel was vibrating

2861
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:04,079
the car was vibrating and there was a

2862
02:08:01,439 --> 02:08:06,960
tingling sensation that passed through

2863
02:08:04,078 --> 02:08:09,840
betty's and barney's bodies and caused

2864
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:12,319
them to feel a little numb

2865
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:16,960
the next thing they were new

2866
02:08:12,319 --> 02:08:19,920
they were 35 miles south of the fields

2867
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,960
they hadn't spoken another word to each

2868
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:23,039
other

2869
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:25,359
you would think that betty would have

2870
02:08:23,039 --> 02:08:26,560
asked barney what he had observed in the

2871
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:27,839
field

2872
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:30,000
you would think that they would be

2873
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:33,360
discussing this thing

2874
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,920
they didn't they didn't speak for 35

2875
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:38,078
miles as far as they could remember they

2876
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:41,279
know from the signs on the road how many

2877
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:43,439
miles to some place you see

2878
02:08:41,279 --> 02:08:45,759
okay this is a map

2879
02:08:43,439 --> 02:08:47,919
okay this is twin mountain their first

2880
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:51,280
stop was at the mount cleveland picnic

2881
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:54,078
area here just south of twin mountain at

2882
02:08:51,279 --> 02:08:56,000
about 10 50 p.m it might have been a

2883
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:59,279
little earlier than that when they

2884
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:01,118
arrived but when i was driving through

2885
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:05,198
uh reenacting

2886
02:09:01,118 --> 02:09:07,279
their trip for myself i had to drive

2887
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:09,279
more slowly than betty and barney were

2888
02:09:07,279 --> 02:09:10,960
driving back then it's more heavily

2889
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:12,960
populated now

2890
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:16,158
barney was driving along at a fairly

2891
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:19,599
rapid clip 50 55 miles an hour according

2892
02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:22,000
to his testimony we had to slow down

2893
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:25,440
as we were passing through

2894
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:27,920
here's the old man of the mountain

2895
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:30,879
that's the second stop

2896
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:34,560
i estimated it was about 11.50 but when

2897
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:37,279
betty passed by cannon mountain she told

2898
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:39,840
dr simon that she looked at her watch

2899
02:09:37,279 --> 02:09:43,118
and she thought it was about 11 20 at

2900
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:45,840
that time so i again may be off

2901
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:48,960
this is the third stop

2902
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:51,199
at the close encounter field

2903
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:53,359
they thought it was about midnight then

2904
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:54,799
i arrived it would have been about 12

2905
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:56,000
15.

2906
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:58,239
and then

2907
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,800
later on they found out that there was a

2908
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:03,839
capture site that they didn't recall

2909
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:07,279
initially until hypnosis and this is

2910
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:07,279
where that was located

2911
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:14,800
now a point that needs to be made when

2912
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:17,198
we were there to do a movie and i won't

2913
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:18,320
talk about the movie

2914
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:19,279
but

2915
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:20,960
uh

2916
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:22,238
when you're standing at that location

2917
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:23,599
where barney was looking with his

2918
02:10:22,238 --> 02:10:25,598
glasses

2919
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:27,760
and you realize that very shortly after

2920
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:31,599
that he gets off the main road onto a

2921
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:33,840
secondary road and then onto a dirt road

2922
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:36,159
there is no possible way he would have

2923
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:38,639
done that on his own

2924
02:10:36,158 --> 02:10:41,598
makes absolutely no sense

2925
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:43,840
he was being directed

2926
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:45,920
to a rather unique spot in the whole

2927
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:48,078
area it's a heavy heavily wooded part of

2928
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:50,639
the country as you can see the trees are

2929
02:10:48,078 --> 02:10:53,198
tall this is not new mexico desert

2930
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:57,440
this is wooded new hampshire

2931
02:10:53,198 --> 02:10:58,479
and yet they wind up on this very narrow

2932
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:01,359
road

2933
02:10:58,479 --> 02:11:02,718
no lights no traffic no people no

2934
02:11:01,359 --> 02:11:06,158
buildings

2935
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:09,279
why would anybody go there you know

2936
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:12,238
and they see a roadblock and beings

2937
02:11:09,279 --> 02:11:12,238
meant in the road

2938
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:15,920
they couldn't make any sense out of this

2939
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:18,000
what was going on here is there an

2940
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:20,960
accident there's no traffic there's not

2941
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:23,198
no reason for there to be anybody there

2942
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:25,198
so let's look at the next slide i just

2943
02:11:23,198 --> 02:11:27,678
wanted to mention that in their

2944
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:30,238
conscious recollection

2945
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:32,880
there was a roadblock

2946
02:11:30,238 --> 02:11:37,158
they just didn't know when or where it

2947
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:37,159
occurred that was a mystery

2948
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:41,039
and

2949
02:11:39,439 --> 02:11:43,279
they saw this

2950
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:45,599
you can call it a fiery orb a bright

2951
02:11:43,279 --> 02:11:46,880
light some source of light ahead of them

2952
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:49,760
in the road

2953
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,118
it was moving but they weren't moving

2954
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,800
i thought it might be the moon but

2955
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:54,158
obviously the moon isn't down on road

2956
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,520
level

2957
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:57,439
uh

2958
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,440
it couldn't have been the moon

2959
02:11:57,439 --> 02:12:02,000
so they're totally puzzled about this

2960
02:11:59,439 --> 02:12:03,678
situation what's going on what's

2961
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,118
happening let's look at that and i'd

2962
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:10,639
like to play for you barney's statement

2963
02:12:07,118 --> 02:12:10,639
about that experience

2964
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:16,800
this was part

2965
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:18,639
the moon be on the highway

2966
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:21,360
in that kind of position

2967
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:23,599
and i could never seem to find any

2968
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:26,319
uh terrain up there that would fit what

2969
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:28,159
i sort of dimly remembered

2970
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:30,319
uh this thing was sitting there like and

2971
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:31,118
i kept remembering these men flagging me

2972
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:33,759
down

2973
02:12:31,118 --> 02:12:35,279
and then i sort of don't remember

2974
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,679
and now i

2975
02:12:35,279 --> 02:12:37,679
remember

2976
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,520
okay

2977
02:12:43,198 --> 02:12:47,359
next thing they remember is this gap

2978
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:49,360
they see this orb whatever it is in the

2979
02:12:47,359 --> 02:12:51,279
road they see men

2980
02:12:49,359 --> 02:12:53,519
beings around it

2981
02:12:51,279 --> 02:12:55,359
and then it's like everything fades out

2982
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,199
the next thing they remember is a number

2983
02:12:55,359 --> 02:12:59,759
another set of these

2984
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:00,799
buzzing beeping sounds the car shaking

2985
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:03,920
maybe

2986
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:05,199
and they're 35 miles down the road

2987
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:07,279
and now they're back in full

2988
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:10,559
consciousness

2989
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:12,719
except that it's it's seamless

2990
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:14,880
they've been alert and awake now they're

2991
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:16,560
alert and awake and in between

2992
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:18,239
nothing

2993
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:20,159
how do you drive a car without knowing

2994
02:13:18,238 --> 02:13:23,598
what you're doing you know

2995
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:23,598
so let's look at the next one

2996
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:30,719
and so they kept on about their business

2997
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:33,359
uh coming down this way heading

2998
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:35,039
portsmouth is on the coast

2999
02:13:33,359 --> 02:13:36,960
on the atlantic coast

3000
02:13:35,039 --> 02:13:39,118
concord's the capital and so many of the

3001
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:41,279
signs said how far it was to concord

3002
02:13:39,118 --> 02:13:42,559
that's your measuring label

3003
02:13:41,279 --> 02:13:43,439
here

3004
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:45,360
and

3005
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:47,519
they expected to get home about three in

3006
02:13:45,359 --> 02:13:51,118
the morning

3007
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,119
uh but that's not what happened

3008
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:58,719
they arrived home

3009
02:13:55,920 --> 02:14:00,480
at 5 15 a.m

3010
02:13:58,719 --> 02:14:03,039
they checked their watches when they

3011
02:14:00,479 --> 02:14:04,000
arrived home but they were no longer

3012
02:14:03,039 --> 02:14:05,920
working

3013
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,238
they wound them

3014
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:09,920
those watches never worked again they

3015
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:12,078
went into the house

3016
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:15,679
barney went into the house first he

3017
02:14:12,078 --> 02:14:17,599
looked at the clock it was about 5 15 am

3018
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:19,199
he said

3019
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:20,719
arrived a little bit later than i

3020
02:14:19,198 --> 02:14:23,039
anticipated

3021
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:25,840
betty stayed outside walking the dog

3022
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:28,319
delsie and she talked about how she

3023
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:30,960
could hear the birds chirping

3024
02:14:28,319 --> 02:14:32,960
it was already daylight

3025
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:34,239
this is september mind you september

3026
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,639
20th

3027
02:14:34,238 --> 02:14:38,479
the birds shouldn't be chirping at three

3028
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:41,840
in the morning

3029
02:14:38,479 --> 02:14:45,118
barney sensed a strange sensation in his

3030
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:48,239
groin a little itchiness and he went

3031
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:49,839
into the bathroom and checked himself to

3032
02:14:48,238 --> 02:14:51,519
see what was wrong he didn't see

3033
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:55,520
anything then

3034
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:58,239
but not long after that 21

3035
02:14:55,520 --> 02:15:02,079
three-quarter inch growths

3036
02:14:58,238 --> 02:15:04,238
appeared in a perfect concentric circle

3037
02:15:02,078 --> 02:15:05,359
on his groin

3038
02:15:04,238 --> 02:15:08,638
later

3039
02:15:05,359 --> 02:15:11,598
under hypnosis he would tell dr simon

3040
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:14,078
that he could feel a cup-like device

3041
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:16,319
being placed over his groin in that

3042
02:15:14,078 --> 02:15:18,960
exact location

3043
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:20,840
those growths

3044
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:23,439
became infected

3045
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:26,239
inflamed when barney was undergoing

3046
02:15:23,439 --> 02:15:28,719
hypnosis with dr simon and he had to

3047
02:15:26,238 --> 02:15:30,799
have them surgically removed at that

3048
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:32,000
time this is two years after the event

3049
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,079
mind you

3050
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,399
but the growth appeared shortly there

3051
02:15:34,078 --> 02:15:40,319
after the event yeah okay but the

3052
02:15:36,399 --> 02:15:41,359
inflammation was later yes it was later

3053
02:15:40,319 --> 02:15:44,399
so

3054
02:15:41,359 --> 02:15:46,078
i do want to uh stress the point that

3055
02:15:44,399 --> 02:15:50,399
the lab report

3056
02:15:46,078 --> 02:15:52,238
stated that they were not venereal warts

3057
02:15:50,399 --> 02:15:55,359
the debunkers tend to say that that's

3058
02:15:52,238 --> 02:15:58,238
what they were they were not

3059
02:15:55,359 --> 02:16:01,359
uh he and betty felt clammy as if they

3060
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:04,399
had been contaminated by something more

3061
02:16:01,359 --> 02:16:07,198
than anyone would feel just from driving

3062
02:16:04,399 --> 02:16:08,399
to monitor from not montreal to new

3063
02:16:07,198 --> 02:16:11,279
hampshire

3064
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:13,359
and there uh as i said the what the

3065
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:15,439
binocular strap was broken and their

3066
02:16:13,359 --> 02:16:17,679
watches had stopped and never worked

3067
02:16:15,439 --> 02:16:20,000
again

3068
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:23,118
the tops of barney's shoes were scraped

3069
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:26,078
he was a meticulous dresser

3070
02:16:23,118 --> 02:16:29,679
he had to wear those shoes for yard work

3071
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:32,478
after that he had no explanation

3072
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:34,558
logical explanation for how this had

3073
02:16:32,478 --> 02:16:37,438
happened they weren't just slightly

3074
02:16:34,558 --> 02:16:40,318
scuffed they were scraped his words were

3075
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:40,318
they were scraped

3076
02:16:41,439 --> 02:16:46,398
they went into separate rooms

3077
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:49,439
and they drew sketches of what they had

3078
02:16:46,398 --> 02:16:51,358
observed standard practice

3079
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:53,120
you do it with your kids they both say

3080
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:54,800
they saw something well you sit down

3081
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:57,200
here and draw what you saw and you sit

3082
02:16:54,799 --> 02:16:58,478
down here and draw what you saw so they

3083
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,800
each

3084
02:16:58,478 --> 02:17:02,718
drew what they could recall

3085
02:17:00,799 --> 02:17:05,119
this is without hypnosis at this point

3086
02:17:02,718 --> 02:17:05,119
in time

3087
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:10,159
and

3088
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:11,439
two drawings pretty darn similar

3089
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:13,439
and

3090
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:15,359
it should be noted that these kind of

3091
02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:17,519
wings or whatever you want to call them

3092
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:18,318
slid out from the side

3093
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:20,478
so

3094
02:17:18,318 --> 02:17:21,840
red light then gradually as it came

3095
02:17:20,478 --> 02:17:24,000
closer to the ground and there were

3096
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:25,439
windows with beings being seen on the

3097
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,959
other side

3098
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:28,479
neither one of these two was a great

3099
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:29,678
artist you understand

3100
02:17:28,478 --> 02:17:32,239
but

3101
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:33,920
uh close enough

3102
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:36,799
to say that they were drawing the same

3103
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:38,318
thing this was a temporary apparently

3104
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:40,558
appendage

3105
02:17:38,318 --> 02:17:42,398
i call it a wing but that's probably not

3106
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:43,358
a good name for it

3107
02:17:42,398 --> 02:17:45,279
okay

3108
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:48,239
and i just did want to mention that

3109
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:50,319
barney drew figures behind the windows

3110
02:17:48,239 --> 02:17:52,638
whereas betty did not

3111
02:17:50,318 --> 02:17:55,279
that's because barney observed those

3112
02:17:52,638 --> 02:17:58,318
figures when he was in the field and had

3113
02:17:55,280 --> 02:18:00,639
the binoculars and betty was in the car

3114
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:04,398
so she was drawing what she saw

3115
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:06,718
initially in the car before

3116
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:10,840
the craft shifted over the field and

3117
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:10,839
barney walked toward it

3118
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:17,519
now betty had put on a fairly new dress

3119
02:18:14,718 --> 02:18:19,839
the morning of the trip from montreal to

3120
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:21,920
portsmouth

3121
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,799
and when she arrived home

3122
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:26,879
the zipper was torn at the top of the

3123
02:18:24,799 --> 02:18:28,879
zipper there was a two inch tear on one

3124
02:18:26,879 --> 02:18:31,279
side and a one inch tear on the other

3125
02:18:28,879 --> 02:18:31,279
side

3126
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:35,599
no mundane explanation for that all she

3127
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:38,879
did is

3128
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:41,599
ride in the car she got out a few times

3129
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:44,000
she ate a couple of restaurants

3130
02:18:41,599 --> 02:18:44,880
no explanation for this

3131
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,920
the

3132
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:50,558
lining was torn from waste to hemline

3133
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:53,040
and the ham was torn down on one side

3134
02:18:50,558 --> 02:18:54,799
she knew it had to be repaired so she

3135
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:55,840
folded it up and she placed it in her

3136
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:58,718
closet

3137
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:00,639
the next time she went to her closet

3138
02:18:58,718 --> 02:19:02,799
to retrieve the dress it was covered

3139
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:05,598
with a pink powdery substance that

3140
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:07,518
degraded the fabric and destroyed the

3141
02:19:05,599 --> 02:19:09,840
dress

3142
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:12,559
she hung the dress up on the clothesline

3143
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:16,318
the pink powder blew away but it had

3144
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:18,959
discolored the dress permanently

3145
02:19:16,318 --> 02:19:21,439
and this is the dress here

3146
02:19:18,959 --> 02:19:23,438
you can see that part of it

3147
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:25,840
this area right here

3148
02:19:23,439 --> 02:19:27,599
is still blue that was the original blue

3149
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:30,079
color of the dress

3150
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:32,719
but there are areas

3151
02:19:30,079 --> 02:19:35,280
where it was completely saturated with

3152
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:37,839
this pink powdery substance

3153
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:40,239
and these were the areas where betty

3154
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:43,599
later told dr simon

3155
02:19:40,239 --> 02:19:47,119
that these alien beings who had abducted

3156
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:49,840
her had wrapped their hands around her

3157
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:49,840
shoulders

3158
02:19:50,879 --> 02:19:55,438
there's another view of the dress you

3159
02:19:52,639 --> 02:19:57,358
can see that some swaths have been cut

3160
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:59,439
out of the dress those were for the

3161
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:00,720
chemical analyses that the dress

3162
02:19:59,439 --> 02:20:03,200
underwent

3163
02:20:00,719 --> 02:20:05,438
they underwent four chemical analyses

3164
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:08,800
and uh i have written about that and

3165
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:14,159
captured and they also uh

3166
02:20:08,799 --> 02:20:14,159
were used in a seed growth experiment

3167
02:20:14,879 --> 02:20:20,000
this is phyllis buttinger

3168
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:22,319
she has a master's degree in chemistry

3169
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:24,799
she did the most extensive chemical

3170
02:20:22,318 --> 02:20:27,519
analysis on the dress she was a research

3171
02:20:24,799 --> 02:20:30,478
scientist for bp amico previously

3172
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:32,479
standard oil for 35 years she

3173
02:20:30,478 --> 02:20:35,760
specialized in

3174
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:38,639
petroleum chemical and polymer analyses

3175
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:41,040
using spectroscopic techniques

3176
02:20:38,639 --> 02:20:44,559
and currently she is the technical

3177
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:48,800
director of frontier analysis limited

3178
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:51,840
laboratory in chagrin falls ohio

3179
02:20:48,799 --> 02:20:55,199
a quite respectable chemist

3180
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:58,318
you can read more about it in captured

3181
02:20:55,200 --> 02:21:02,240
but her conclusion at the end of this

3182
02:20:58,318 --> 02:21:05,279
analysis was and i quote i am convinced

3183
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:08,159
that the event did happen as determined

3184
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:11,560
by the chemical analysis i did on betty

3185
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:11,559
hill's dress

3186
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:16,720
well

3187
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:21,039
my mother was the first person that

3188
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:23,358
betty called when she arrived home

3189
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:26,720
barney had advised her that they should

3190
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:29,280
forget about the entire event that no

3191
02:21:26,719 --> 02:21:31,840
good could possibly come of it

3192
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:34,880
but betty and my mother were very close

3193
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:35,680
and lived 20 miles apart

3194
02:21:34,879 --> 02:21:39,358
and

3195
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:39,359
so when she called my mother

3196
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:45,760
my mother suggested that she would call

3197
02:21:42,478 --> 02:21:47,760
a neighbor of ours who was a physicist

3198
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:50,159
and see what the physicist

3199
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:52,559
had to say about this whole thing betty

3200
02:21:50,159 --> 02:21:55,200
was worried about contamination

3201
02:21:52,559 --> 02:21:57,680
uh what might have happened to them and

3202
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:59,760
the physicist told my mother to advise

3203
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:01,680
betty that if she had a compass she

3204
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:04,559
should take it out to the car to see how

3205
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:06,800
the needle of the compass would react

3206
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:09,039
she did find a compass and she took it

3207
02:22:06,799 --> 02:22:11,119
out and

3208
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:14,399
when she went out there she noticed

3209
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:16,720
there were some new very shiny spots on

3210
02:22:14,398 --> 02:22:19,840
the trunk of the vehicle that hadn't

3211
02:22:16,719 --> 02:22:23,438
been there the day before there were 12

3212
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:25,120
to 18 of them and they were very shiny

3213
02:22:23,439 --> 02:22:27,600
and i'm going to play for you both

3214
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:30,800
betty's and barney's descriptions of

3215
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:33,520
what those spots looked like i also saw

3216
02:22:30,799 --> 02:22:36,239
these spots this is a facsimile because

3217
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:37,680
none of us thought to take a photograph

3218
02:22:36,239 --> 02:22:39,439
of those spots

3219
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:43,040
but this is based upon betty's and

3220
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:44,960
barney's descriptions and upon my memory

3221
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:46,800
of what i observed

3222
02:22:44,959 --> 02:22:50,239
there was nothing about an abduction up

3223
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:52,398
to this point in their minds

3224
02:22:50,239 --> 02:22:54,239
so the significance wasn't yet known of

3225
02:22:52,398 --> 02:22:55,358
this whole experience it was like a

3226
02:22:54,239 --> 02:22:57,520
whacker

3227
02:22:55,359 --> 02:22:59,120
put on over the color and even when i

3228
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:02,960
waxed the car

3229
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:05,520
the shot and the spot still was shiny

3230
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:07,279
and

3231
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:09,439
it had been raining

3232
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:13,439
that day

3233
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:14,800
and uh the car was all wet still left

3234
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:16,239
and

3235
02:23:14,799 --> 02:23:18,239
i thought well

3236
02:23:16,239 --> 02:23:21,680
i started

3237
02:23:18,239 --> 02:23:23,600
on the side of the calf

3238
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:25,120
to see what would happen and i kept

3239
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:28,159
going

3240
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:30,479
closer and closer to the trunk

3241
02:23:28,159 --> 02:23:32,239
and then it was when i started to go to

3242
02:23:30,478 --> 02:23:33,358
the trunk of the compass that i noticed

3243
02:23:32,239 --> 02:23:36,799
the

3244
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:38,800
shiny spots on the trunk

3245
02:23:36,799 --> 02:23:42,559
that they were

3246
02:23:38,799 --> 02:23:44,239
these very very shiny spots

3247
02:23:42,559 --> 02:23:47,199
about

3248
02:23:44,239 --> 02:23:48,799
the whole cluster album

3249
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:51,520
about the size of

3250
02:23:48,799 --> 02:23:54,159
i don't know half dollars or

3251
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:57,120
clover dollar something like that

3252
02:23:54,159 --> 02:23:57,119
and there must have been

3253
02:23:57,520 --> 02:24:02,319
oh twelve or eight billion several

3254
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:06,000
twelve a dozen i would say

3255
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:08,000
all around the spot and very shiny

3256
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,398
and

3257
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,040
when i've just got the compass anywhere

3258
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:13,039
it's near them

3259
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:18,399
the compass kept spinning around and

3260
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:18,399
around and around

3261
02:24:18,639 --> 02:24:23,840
and

3262
02:24:20,478 --> 02:24:23,840
i at this i panicked

3263
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,439
i got more upset at this one spot than i

3264
02:24:26,239 --> 02:24:28,639
did

3265
02:24:27,439 --> 02:24:30,960
at any

3266
02:24:28,639 --> 02:24:33,680
thing she said now let's listen to what

3267
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:33,679
barney said

3268
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:39,359
and i said how can you not know

3269
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:41,680
if it isn't anything and then i put the

3270
02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:44,318
compass close to it

3271
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:46,239
and the compass

3272
02:24:44,318 --> 02:24:47,760
would spin

3273
02:24:46,239 --> 02:24:49,760
and spin

3274
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:51,040
and i could move the compass a few

3275
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:52,719
inches

3276
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:54,960
to a spot

3277
02:24:52,719 --> 02:24:57,840
that did not connect to a

3278
02:24:54,959 --> 02:24:59,199
caught in on the trunk that did not have

3279
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:00,719
a spot

3280
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:03,200
and the compass

3281
02:25:00,719 --> 02:25:04,719
would drop down

3282
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:06,880
and i

3283
02:25:04,719 --> 02:25:09,039
so you can see that betty and barney's

3284
02:25:06,879 --> 02:25:13,839
description of those spots and how the

3285
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:15,760
compass needle reacted were consistent

3286
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:17,920
nobody understands why that would happen

3287
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:21,280
you understand

3288
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:23,680
the spots were located in the exact uh

3289
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:25,760
location where the hills said they heard

3290
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:28,079
beeping or buzzing sounds that caused

3291
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:30,239
the vehicle to vibrate and that

3292
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:32,639
vibration to cause their bodies to

3293
02:25:30,239 --> 02:25:32,639
tingle

3294
02:25:32,799 --> 02:25:37,279
betty washed and waxed the vehicle but

3295
02:25:34,959 --> 02:25:41,799
the spots wouldn't rub out but they

3296
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:41,800
faded away over the winter of 1961-1962

3297
02:25:42,639 --> 02:25:48,719
we i do have a letter in the book uh

3298
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:51,039
quotes from a letter of a meeting that

3299
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:52,959
betty and barney had with air force

3300
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:55,280
officers

3301
02:25:52,959 --> 02:25:57,039
at their church

3302
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:59,280
rectory

3303
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:01,439
where they discussed the spots on the

3304
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:03,920
trunk of the car and speculated about

3305
02:26:01,439 --> 02:26:06,960
what might have caused this this wasn't

3306
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:08,478
part of the official blue book record

3307
02:26:06,959 --> 02:26:10,318
it was a meeting

3308
02:26:08,478 --> 02:26:12,559
brought together by betty and barney

3309
02:26:10,318 --> 02:26:15,199
could never understand why these

3310
02:26:12,559 --> 02:26:18,478
officers came to this meeting it was

3311
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:21,040
supposed to be to listen to poetry

3312
02:26:18,478 --> 02:26:24,000
written by one of the officers but after

3313
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:26,800
he read his poems the officers asked

3314
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:28,879
betty and barney to stay and they had a

3315
02:26:26,799 --> 02:26:31,199
conversation about the spots on the

3316
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:32,879
trunk of the vehicle barney knew people

3317
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:35,920
at the base

3318
02:26:32,879 --> 02:26:37,759
because of his work with civil rights

3319
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:40,478
you see so there was a connection with

3320
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:44,000
the base peace air force base

3321
02:26:40,478 --> 02:26:46,478
just outside port portsmouth

3322
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:49,600
now there has been some speculation that

3323
02:26:46,478 --> 02:26:52,719
they might have just been weather spots

3324
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:54,159
weather spots uh develop when

3325
02:26:52,719 --> 02:26:56,799
it rains

3326
02:26:54,159 --> 02:26:57,920
uh atmospheric pollutants drop down in

3327
02:26:56,799 --> 02:27:00,318
the rain

3328
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:02,639
they deposit on the vehicle

3329
02:27:00,318 --> 02:27:04,478
then the sun comes out and bakes those

3330
02:27:02,639 --> 02:27:06,639
spots on the car

3331
02:27:04,478 --> 02:27:08,799
and you have to use a chemical solution

3332
02:27:06,639 --> 02:27:09,920
to get them off they don't rub off very

3333
02:27:08,799 --> 02:27:13,358
easily

3334
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:16,639
this is what weather marks look like and

3335
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:19,120
you can see here that this is not what

3336
02:27:16,639 --> 02:27:22,959
betty's and barney's marks looked like

3337
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:22,960
does not fit the description

3338
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:30,280
and then here is the facsimile again

3339
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:30,280
just so that you can see the difference

3340
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,280
they

3341
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,520
called the local police

3342
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:39,120
they advised them to call nearby peace

3343
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:41,120
air force base

3344
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:42,160
they did they made a report they were

3345
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:45,280
treated

3346
02:27:42,159 --> 02:27:47,280
fairly decently a record was kept

3347
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:50,960
here's the official project blue book

3348
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:52,239
air intelligence information report

3349
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:54,559
it would

3350
02:27:52,239 --> 02:27:57,520
was taken seriously

3351
02:27:54,559 --> 02:27:58,959
uh the report also included the

3352
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:01,359
interesting

3353
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:03,599
where's the comment about the

3354
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:05,200
radar there what is that

3355
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:08,079
oh on this one

3356
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:09,359
i can't read it though

3357
02:28:08,079 --> 02:28:12,359
can you read it

3358
02:28:09,359 --> 02:28:12,359
um

3359
02:28:12,879 --> 02:28:18,879
there was a radar report it was a radar

3360
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:22,399
report uh it says it was revealed that a

3361
02:28:18,879 --> 02:28:25,279
strange incident occurred at 211 local

3362
02:28:22,398 --> 02:28:27,920
on the 20th of september no importance

3363
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:30,560
was attached to the incidence incident

3364
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:30,559
at the time

3365
02:28:32,159 --> 02:28:37,920
subsequent interrogation failed to bring

3366
02:28:34,639 --> 02:28:42,318
out any information in addition to the

3367
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:44,079
that of the extract of the daily uh

3368
02:28:42,318 --> 02:28:46,079
controller

3369
02:28:44,079 --> 02:28:48,879
and there was also a report on another

3370
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:52,079
radar installation up in uh where are we

3371
02:28:48,879 --> 02:28:54,239
in normal concord vermont yep yes

3372
02:28:52,079 --> 02:28:55,760
blue book tried to push this aside and

3373
02:28:54,239 --> 02:28:57,359
there have been a number of instances

3374
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:59,520
noted where they've changed files and

3375
02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:01,120
records and so forth

3376
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:02,800
but what i'm saying is there's a

3377
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:05,840
definite record of something happening

3378
02:29:02,799 --> 02:29:08,398
at the right time and place and so forth

3379
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:10,159
they were taken seriously

3380
02:29:08,398 --> 02:29:12,398
uh

3381
02:29:10,159 --> 02:29:14,559
let's look at the next but

3382
02:29:12,398 --> 02:29:16,799
i want to mention that this is the

3383
02:29:14,559 --> 02:29:19,600
original handwritten report

3384
02:29:16,799 --> 02:29:21,519
and in the original report

3385
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:24,399
the air force said that there was a

3386
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:26,960
strong inversion in that in the lincoln

3387
02:29:24,398 --> 02:29:29,920
new hampshire area that night

3388
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:33,279
and an uh temperature inversion will

3389
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:36,318
cause a distant object to appear much

3390
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:38,880
closer than it is and one of their

3391
02:29:36,318 --> 02:29:42,639
favorite theories was that this might

3392
02:29:38,879 --> 02:29:44,478
explain ufo sightings that people had

3393
02:29:42,639 --> 02:29:46,639
it was a favorite for the washington

3394
02:29:44,478 --> 02:29:47,920
national airport sightings

3395
02:29:46,639 --> 02:29:50,639
the only trouble is when you check the

3396
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:53,120
weather records uh there wasn't any

3397
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:54,879
temperature conversion

3398
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:56,399
and this is from the mount mount

3399
02:29:54,879 --> 02:29:57,759
washington is the tallest point in new

3400
02:29:56,398 --> 02:29:59,358
hampshire tallest point on the east

3401
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:01,600
coast

3402
02:29:59,359 --> 02:30:03,600
the official weather station archival

3403
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:05,760
records looking back on our records for

3404
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:08,239
the dates in question it appears that

3405
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:11,280
the 19th and 20th were both beautiful

3406
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:13,680
late summer days atop the rock pile

3407
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:15,200
mount washington was the rock pile they

3408
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:17,040
had some of the strongest winds in the

3409
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:18,560
country on average

3410
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:21,280
terrible winters

3411
02:30:18,559 --> 02:30:23,199
rugged kind of place

3412
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:25,040
the evening and nighttime

3413
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:27,200
conditions for the 19th were quite

3414
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:29,600
tranquil winds were from the west at

3415
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:33,680
around 25 miles per hour

3416
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:34,640
visibility was 130 miles throughout the

3417
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:36,880
night

3418
02:30:34,639 --> 02:30:39,119
but dropped to 75 miles during the

3419
02:30:36,879 --> 02:30:41,279
morning hours of the 20th

3420
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:43,439
uh there was a movie well we'll talk

3421
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:47,840
about that but in which the windshield

3422
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:47,840
wipers are shown going like mad

3423
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:51,920
it wasn't raining when you got 130 miles

3424
02:30:50,398 --> 02:30:55,119
of visibility

3425
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:55,120
it's not bad weather

3426
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:59,920
some critics have also stated that the

3427
02:30:58,318 --> 02:31:02,398
weather people at the top of mount

3428
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:04,478
washington would have observed the craft

3429
02:31:02,398 --> 02:31:05,519
if it had really been there on that

3430
02:31:04,478 --> 02:31:07,920
night

3431
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:11,439
uh there was a letter written to the

3432
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:15,200
weathermen up there and they said that

3433
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:17,760
due to uh their job the type of job they

3434
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:20,240
had they only went outside of the

3435
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:22,478
building at night in order to check the

3436
02:31:20,239 --> 02:31:25,039
temperature gauges outside and then they

3437
02:31:22,478 --> 02:31:27,438
returned to the building they would not

3438
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:28,399
have observed anything in the sky that

3439
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:29,920
night

3440
02:31:28,398 --> 02:31:33,920
they're not looking around are there any

3441
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:36,079
flying saucers folks no

3442
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:38,398
the chief meteorologist said it is

3443
02:31:36,079 --> 02:31:39,920
possible a weak inversion set up in the

3444
02:31:38,398 --> 02:31:42,000
valleys overnight

3445
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:44,239
as the valley locations are more prone

3446
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,398
to the diurnal day night effects of the

3447
02:31:44,239 --> 02:31:48,239
sun but i think that the cloud cover

3448
02:31:46,398 --> 02:31:50,079
would have prevented any radiational

3449
02:31:48,239 --> 02:31:51,760
cooling in the valley so there wasn't

3450
02:31:50,079 --> 02:31:54,239
any inversion

3451
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:56,318
that's what the chief meteorologist said

3452
02:31:54,239 --> 02:31:58,559
and

3453
02:31:56,318 --> 02:31:58,559
uh

3454
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:01,840
as

3455
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:04,000
things went on and we haven't mentioned

3456
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:07,120
that but we did mention you'd gone down

3457
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:10,079
there yes seen the car witnessed it so

3458
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:13,840
personal experience etc

3459
02:32:10,079 --> 02:32:17,840
ten days later about betty began to have

3460
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:20,159
nightmares had five of them

3461
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:23,120
they included a conscious memory of a

3462
02:32:20,159 --> 02:32:25,520
close encounter with a ufo

3463
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:27,680
she also dreamed of an abduction by the

3464
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:29,200
crafts occupants

3465
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:31,600
i think you're all aware that sometimes

3466
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:33,439
the events of our daytime life show up

3467
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:35,600
in our dreams

3468
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:38,880
so something was going on here but betty

3469
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:41,200
being betty she recorded the dreams

3470
02:32:38,879 --> 02:32:43,839
she kept a record of them now remember

3471
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:46,479
barney work nights

3472
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:49,359
betty work days

3473
02:32:46,478 --> 02:32:49,358
let's look at the next

3474
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:55,680
okay now

3475
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:56,479
the event took place in 1961 september

3476
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:59,200
okay

3477
02:32:56,478 --> 02:33:00,799
barney developed some ulcers some

3478
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:04,240
problems

3479
02:33:00,799 --> 02:33:06,478
health problems went to a doctor

3480
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:08,159
uh you know got to take care of the the

3481
02:33:06,478 --> 02:33:10,559
ulcer problem

3482
02:33:08,159 --> 02:33:13,439
got blood pressure problems

3483
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:14,879
and the doctor told barney that uh look

3484
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:16,720
i've done all i can for you with

3485
02:33:14,879 --> 02:33:19,358
conventional medicine something else is

3486
02:33:16,719 --> 02:33:20,959
going on here

3487
02:33:19,359 --> 02:33:23,840
he recommended that they see a

3488
02:33:20,959 --> 02:33:23,839
psychiatrist

3489
02:33:24,478 --> 02:33:29,039
because remember back then ulcers were

3490
02:33:26,799 --> 02:33:30,879
thought to be caused by mental stress

3491
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:32,319
and if you could control the stresses

3492
02:33:30,879 --> 02:33:35,279
you could take care of the ulcers to

3493
02:33:32,318 --> 02:33:37,840
some extent to make a long story short

3494
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:40,880
he wound up in the office of doctor they

3495
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:42,880
wound up dr benjamin simon

3496
02:33:40,879 --> 02:33:46,478
now benjamin simon didn't know a darn

3497
02:33:42,879 --> 02:33:49,839
thing about ufos but

3498
02:33:46,478 --> 02:33:51,840
he was a world-class expert

3499
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:54,079
on helping people

3500
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:56,960
uncover

3501
02:33:54,079 --> 02:33:57,920
hidden memories if you will

3502
02:33:56,959 --> 02:34:00,398
uh

3503
02:33:57,920 --> 02:34:02,398
is specifically dealing with world war

3504
02:34:00,398 --> 02:34:04,000
ii shall shock war veterans that's what

3505
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:07,039
they used to call it today it's

3506
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:08,559
post-traumatic stress disorder

3507
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:10,479
well you know

3508
02:34:08,559 --> 02:34:12,000
your body's head gets blown off next to

3509
02:34:10,478 --> 02:34:14,318
you

3510
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,680
it's a little hard to integrate that

3511
02:34:14,318 --> 02:34:19,359
into your

3512
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:21,920
life you know why me not or him not me

3513
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:24,000
and how do i live with that and

3514
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:26,478
you know these are dif people are coming

3515
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,318
back from iraq and afghanistan with

3516
02:34:26,478 --> 02:34:29,519
these things

3517
02:34:28,318 --> 02:34:31,039
uh

3518
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:33,840
and so

3519
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:36,000
dr simon actually ran a hospital with 3

3520
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:38,079
000 beds

3521
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,840
for shell shock war veterans

3522
02:34:38,079 --> 02:34:42,000
yeah the greatest success of any of the

3523
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:44,159
psychiatrists it's never 100 percent i'd

3524
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:46,478
better add not everybody is able to get

3525
02:34:44,159 --> 02:34:48,478
back to a normal life

3526
02:34:46,478 --> 02:34:50,559
but he even stars

3527
02:34:48,478 --> 02:34:53,039
in a movie let there be light that the

3528
02:34:50,559 --> 02:34:54,719
army made

3529
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:57,359
showing his techniques that he had

3530
02:34:54,719 --> 02:34:59,519
developed using regressive hypnosis

3531
02:34:57,359 --> 02:35:00,800
somebody who was blind was able to see

3532
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:03,920
again

3533
02:35:00,799 --> 02:35:06,239
we're not talking mythical stories here

3534
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:08,239
the army wanted these people to get back

3535
02:35:06,239 --> 02:35:10,398
to living again

3536
02:35:08,239 --> 02:35:12,879
and dr simon was the best equipped

3537
02:35:10,398 --> 02:35:14,719
probably of anybody around

3538
02:35:12,879 --> 02:35:17,039
who could have had the chore of trying

3539
02:35:14,719 --> 02:35:18,478
to uncover what happened he was not in

3540
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,720
boston

3541
02:35:18,478 --> 02:35:22,959
and he conducted his sessions each

3542
02:35:20,719 --> 02:35:24,840
separately

3543
02:35:22,959 --> 02:35:28,639
not together

3544
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:31,600
and in induced

3545
02:35:28,639 --> 02:35:32,799
amnesia at the end of each session

3546
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:34,880
two purposes

3547
02:35:32,799 --> 02:35:36,239
they couldn't remember it themselves and

3548
02:35:34,879 --> 02:35:37,519
they couldn't talk to the other one

3549
02:35:36,239 --> 02:35:41,039
about it

3550
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:42,960
he was taping all these sessions

3551
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:46,319
and eventually

3552
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:49,119
played back the tapes to them together

3553
02:35:46,318 --> 02:35:51,279
and his whole purpose was to get

3554
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:53,200
the feelings out to have them relive

3555
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:56,960
these experiences

3556
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:59,520
so we could show them they're okay now

3557
02:35:56,959 --> 02:36:01,438
they can live with it

3558
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:02,720
the truth shall set you free something i

3559
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:05,120
don't know who said that i don't know

3560
02:36:02,719 --> 02:36:07,599
who said that but it doesn't matter

3561
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:09,439
so ben simon was

3562
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:11,040
not an expert on flying saucers and

3563
02:36:09,439 --> 02:36:13,120
listening to the tapes sometimes you get

3564
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:14,479
the feeling why didn't he ask of this

3565
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:15,920
that or the other thing well he wasn't

3566
02:36:14,478 --> 02:36:17,039
interested in the saucer part of the

3567
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:18,559
story

3568
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:20,720
he was interested in helping two

3569
02:36:18,559 --> 02:36:22,478
obviously sensible sensitive intelligent

3570
02:36:20,719 --> 02:36:24,398
people

3571
02:36:22,478 --> 02:36:26,478
get their lives back

3572
02:36:24,398 --> 02:36:30,318
after what was clearly a strange

3573
02:36:26,478 --> 02:36:32,398
experience that was disturbing to them

3574
02:36:30,318 --> 02:36:34,159
so it wasn't the next week the next

3575
02:36:32,398 --> 02:36:35,680
month it wasn't carl sagan did an

3576
02:36:34,159 --> 02:36:37,600
article which made it sound like there

3577
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:39,680
was one hypnosis session where they came

3578
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:41,359
up with this and bull story

3579
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:43,600
nonsense

3580
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:45,280
and as a matter of fact

3581
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:48,318
we have it in writing that the emotional

3582
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:50,720
intensity in one session each

3583
02:36:48,318 --> 02:36:53,519
was greater than that in the voices of

3584
02:36:50,719 --> 02:36:56,318
any of the military guys that dr simon

3585
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,319
had worked with

3586
02:36:56,639 --> 02:37:02,079
he had to stop those sessions

3587
02:36:59,439 --> 02:37:05,120
he was afraid they couldn't handle it

3588
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:06,639
the terror is quite clear

3589
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:08,079
and i mentioned this because you'll hear

3590
02:37:06,639 --> 02:37:09,760
people saying

3591
02:37:08,079 --> 02:37:11,039
what was it class said

3592
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:12,478
that he

3593
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:15,040
didn't get excited it was like she was

3594
02:37:12,478 --> 02:37:16,639
taking a stroll in the supermarket

3595
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:18,720
it sure doesn't come across that way

3596
02:37:16,639 --> 02:37:19,920
when you listen to the tape

3597
02:37:18,719 --> 02:37:21,760
barney

3598
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:23,040
is terror stricken

3599
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:24,639
and remember

3600
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:27,680
there had been no

3601
02:37:24,639 --> 02:37:29,680
abduction cases that had been publicized

3602
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:31,520
there's nothing to draw upon about what

3603
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:34,398
happened here if you're being abducted

3604
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:36,800
by somebody are you going to get back

3605
02:37:34,398 --> 02:37:38,478
what's going to happen to you

3606
02:37:36,799 --> 02:37:40,000
is your life going down the drain while

3607
02:37:38,478 --> 02:37:41,920
these guys get when they get finished

3608
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,959
with you they throw you away but you

3609
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:46,478
know

3610
02:37:42,959 --> 02:37:49,599
so there's an inate terror aside from

3611
02:37:46,478 --> 02:37:51,760
their having you under their control

3612
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:54,000
and doing physical examinations and

3613
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:56,559
other stuff which none of us are

3614
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:58,799
nobody wants to be a specimen

3615
02:37:56,559 --> 02:38:01,119
which is how they were treated

3616
02:37:58,799 --> 02:38:04,879
for fair enough statement yes

3617
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:05,840
so he was quite a remarkable guy

3618
02:38:04,879 --> 02:38:07,679
and

3619
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:09,840
it's important to recognize that this

3620
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:12,398
was a real expert

3621
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:14,398
not in flying saucers

3622
02:38:12,398 --> 02:38:18,000
but in helping people get through

3623
02:38:14,398 --> 02:38:18,000
difficult experiences

3624
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:22,640
and as they're reliving this experience

3625
02:38:20,879 --> 02:38:25,358
they realize that

3626
02:38:22,639 --> 02:38:26,799
remember that business about the orb

3627
02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:28,399
they saw this light in the road and some

3628
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:30,478
men around it and stuff that they

3629
02:38:28,398 --> 02:38:32,000
remembered that consciously not very

3630
02:38:30,478 --> 02:38:34,478
clearly

3631
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,398
now they're going over it

3632
02:38:34,478 --> 02:38:37,199
and when you're up in that country the

3633
02:38:36,398 --> 02:38:39,760
uh

3634
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:43,840
the trees are tall the

3635
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:43,840
road is narrow no lights

3636
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:49,520
oops

3637
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:55,040
i kept driving and driving and i made a

3638
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:57,280
turn and i never knew this i don't know

3639
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:58,880
why i had to make that turn

3640
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:01,439
as i say when you stand at the spot

3641
02:38:58,879 --> 02:39:03,199
where he first sees the leader through

3642
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:05,600
the binoculars

3643
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,479
you get the very strong feeling that he

3644
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:09,359
was

3645
02:39:06,478 --> 02:39:11,039
being directed

3646
02:39:09,359 --> 02:39:13,600
where to go

3647
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:15,359
and the place they wound up

3648
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:18,159
was the only place in the area where you

3649
02:39:15,359 --> 02:39:19,520
could sit down a large saucer

3650
02:39:18,159 --> 02:39:22,398
empty

3651
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:24,880
lot i'll call it sandy area this is very

3652
02:39:22,398 --> 02:39:27,760
heavily forested land and at night it's

3653
02:39:24,879 --> 02:39:30,398
dark out there i'll tell you that

3654
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:31,439
the sand is kind of whitish

3655
02:39:30,398 --> 02:39:33,439
so

3656
02:39:31,439 --> 02:39:35,280
he was there because they wanted him

3657
02:39:33,439 --> 02:39:36,880
there

3658
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:38,640
and from the air of course you could see

3659
02:39:36,879 --> 02:39:40,879
where could you set down a saucer where

3660
02:39:38,639 --> 02:39:43,358
could you bring a car in and so forth

3661
02:39:40,879 --> 02:39:43,358
and so on

3662
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:50,719
there's the comment

3663
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:52,559
when betty was talking about her dreams

3664
02:39:50,719 --> 02:39:53,760
i saw eight to eleven men standing in

3665
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:56,239
the middle of the road the men

3666
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:59,359
surrounded the car we sat motionless

3667
02:39:56,239 --> 02:39:59,359
that's what she said

3668
02:40:00,318 --> 02:40:05,000
let's listen to

3669
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:05,000
the description

3670
02:40:08,799 --> 02:40:13,358
then i thought well you know are they in

3671
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:15,600
a car and the car broken down or

3672
02:40:13,359 --> 02:40:16,720
so what are they doing there

3673
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:19,520
and

3674
02:40:16,719 --> 02:40:21,519
bonnie first had to stop

3675
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:23,760
and then

3676
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:23,760
he

3677
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:29,680
he stopped the car

3678
02:40:28,239 --> 02:40:31,279
and we

3679
02:40:29,680 --> 02:40:33,840
decided to

3680
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:36,000
come up to the car

3681
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:36,000
they

3682
02:40:37,439 --> 02:40:41,600
they separated

3683
02:40:38,959 --> 02:40:45,039
they came up in two groups

3684
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:45,040
and when they started to do that

3685
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,840
i i get real scared

3686
02:40:50,639 --> 02:40:54,959
yeah

3687
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:57,120
the the cowboy died the cast off

3688
02:40:54,959 --> 02:40:57,119
and

3689
02:40:57,920 --> 02:41:02,879
when they started coming up the body

3690
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:04,800
tried to stop the car

3691
02:41:02,879 --> 02:41:07,119
he tried to start it

3692
02:41:04,799 --> 02:41:10,438
you know how a road of a cow just turned

3693
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:10,439
over 125.

3694
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:18,318
i just had to count it like that and

3695
02:41:16,079 --> 02:41:20,239
we're gonna collect it

3696
02:41:18,318 --> 02:41:22,079
and i think well

3697
02:41:20,239 --> 02:41:23,520
i can't get away from the vegas if i get

3698
02:41:22,079 --> 02:41:25,520
the car down look like you're running

3699
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:26,800
the woods inside

3700
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:29,120
and

3701
02:41:26,799 --> 02:41:31,119
i'm thinking that i just put my hair out

3702
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:34,800
candle and open it

3703
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:37,920
and just add the make them up and they

3704
02:41:34,799 --> 02:41:37,920
open it for me

3705
02:41:38,719 --> 02:41:44,760
and they open the card door

3706
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:44,760
and then

3707
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:56,200
why did i put his hand out

3708
02:41:58,719 --> 02:42:03,119
i don't know what happened

3709
02:42:01,279 --> 02:42:04,960
did that sound like a trip to the

3710
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:06,880
grocery store to you

3711
02:42:04,959 --> 02:42:08,799
the emotional level of a trip to the

3712
02:42:06,879 --> 02:42:10,719
grocery store

3713
02:42:08,799 --> 02:42:12,478
for a woman who's normally

3714
02:42:10,719 --> 02:42:16,719
very even

3715
02:42:12,478 --> 02:42:20,000
toned this is not an excitable woman

3716
02:42:16,719 --> 02:42:22,398
now in betty's dreams remember she

3717
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:25,279
dreamed that there were eight to 11 men

3718
02:42:22,398 --> 02:42:28,559
they surrounded the car and she and

3719
02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:31,439
barney sat motionless you just saw that

3720
02:42:28,559 --> 02:42:35,278
under hypnosis that's not what happened

3721
02:42:31,439 --> 02:42:37,040
there were three who came to her door

3722
02:42:35,279 --> 02:42:40,040
let's see what barney

3723
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:40,040
described

3724
02:42:44,398 --> 02:42:48,639
i

3725
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:49,439
thought i saw a cluster

3726
02:42:48,639 --> 02:42:52,079
of

3727
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:52,079
six men

3728
02:42:52,159 --> 02:42:55,840
because

3729
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:57,040
they came to me

3730
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:59,600
and three

3731
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:59,600
did not

3732
02:43:00,559 --> 02:43:02,799
i

3733
02:43:03,359 --> 02:43:07,800
didn't think of the man

3734
02:43:10,959 --> 02:43:13,599
said he didn't think of the man in the

3735
02:43:12,559 --> 02:43:15,600
sky

3736
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:16,880
at that time

3737
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:18,479
well

3738
02:43:16,879 --> 02:43:21,679
as you can see

3739
02:43:18,478 --> 02:43:23,840
barney said that three approached him as

3740
02:43:21,680 --> 02:43:23,840
well

3741
02:43:24,079 --> 02:43:29,279
that's not what betty had in her dreams

3742
02:43:26,719 --> 02:43:31,438
there's evidence there that

3743
02:43:29,279 --> 02:43:32,399
what happened might have been a real

3744
02:43:31,439 --> 02:43:35,200
event

3745
02:43:32,398 --> 02:43:38,879
they both made the state same statements

3746
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:42,079
correlating data under hypnosis

3747
02:43:38,879 --> 02:43:43,839
that was not in betty's dream material

3748
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:46,079
the point is some people said there was

3749
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:47,920
no event it was just betty's dream that

3750
02:43:46,079 --> 02:43:49,520
was the whole story

3751
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:51,600
that what came out under hypnosis was

3752
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:53,680
just betty's dreams and barney picked it

3753
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:56,318
up from betty and we got no problem here

3754
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:58,318
it's just you know wishful thinking

3755
02:43:56,318 --> 02:44:00,000
the reality comes out quite different

3756
02:43:58,318 --> 02:44:03,119
from that

3757
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:06,318
and barney could as they each one was

3758
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:08,399
grabbed by three people three beings

3759
02:44:06,318 --> 02:44:11,119
and barney could feel the top of his

3760
02:44:08,398 --> 02:44:13,519
feet bumping against the stones

3761
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:14,399
that's where that scuffed shoes came

3762
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:17,279
from

3763
02:44:14,398 --> 02:44:19,760
this is the sandy area they're being

3764
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:22,079
transported in quotes separately

3765
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:24,719
three with barney three with betty

3766
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:27,359
his eyes were pretty much closed

3767
02:44:24,719 --> 02:44:29,278
they were under control

3768
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:31,200
you want to keep your specimens from

3769
02:44:29,279 --> 02:44:33,359
fighting back in other words nobody

3770
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:35,120
stuck a needle in them they wanted them

3771
02:44:33,359 --> 02:44:36,399
conscious presumably so they could do

3772
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:38,240
what they were told to do when they were

3773
02:44:36,398 --> 02:44:41,039
being tested

3774
02:44:38,239 --> 02:44:41,920
uh but that's where the

3775
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:44,000
shoe

3776
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:45,600
problem seems to have come from

3777
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:47,920
you know think of them sort of hanging a

3778
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:51,359
little bit and being dragged

3779
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:54,079
with his feet behind them on the ground

3780
02:44:51,359 --> 02:44:56,960
barney stated that he felt as if he were

3781
02:44:54,079 --> 02:44:58,879
floating somehow that his arms were

3782
02:44:56,959 --> 02:45:01,919
extended outward

3783
02:44:58,879 --> 02:45:04,478
and that he could just feel the toes of

3784
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:08,159
his shoes bumping along those rocks and

3785
02:45:04,478 --> 02:45:11,199
then sliding along a smooth surface and

3786
02:45:08,159 --> 02:45:12,639
bumping over a surface at the top

3787
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:15,840
smooth surface

3788
02:45:12,639 --> 02:45:15,840
we'll call it a ramp anyway

3789
02:45:16,879 --> 02:45:21,119
betty was feisty

3790
02:45:18,959 --> 02:45:23,358
she was trying to kick these people she

3791
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:25,600
wasn't going to be taking willingness

3792
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:28,399
willingly into whatever it was they

3793
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:30,239
wanted to do with her but so three guys

3794
02:45:28,398 --> 02:45:31,439
on each of them managed to get them up

3795
02:45:30,239 --> 02:45:33,039
this ramp

3796
02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:35,680
over a kind of

3797
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:36,720
lintel i'll call it a doorway kind of

3798
02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:39,760
base

3799
02:45:36,719 --> 02:45:41,840
and they were taken into separate rooms

3800
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:44,398
uh

3801
02:45:41,840 --> 02:45:46,960
this is a clear area here the only space

3802
02:45:44,398 --> 02:45:48,239
in the area we could put down this darn

3803
02:45:46,959 --> 02:45:49,919
saucer

3804
02:45:48,239 --> 02:45:52,959
right next to this

3805
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:54,559
narrow road where they were grabbed

3806
02:45:52,959 --> 02:45:56,239
somebody was paying attention and

3807
02:45:54,559 --> 02:45:58,159
planning

3808
02:45:56,239 --> 02:46:00,959
and when betty struggled at the bottom

3809
02:45:58,159 --> 02:46:03,119
of this ramp it's probably the point at

3810
02:46:00,959 --> 02:46:05,679
which she tore out the

3811
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:07,359
lining of her dress and tore down her

3812
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:08,960
hem

3813
02:46:07,359 --> 02:46:12,239
much more sensible and she's sitting in

3814
02:46:08,959 --> 02:46:15,119
the car and suddenly these things happen

3815
02:46:12,239 --> 02:46:17,520
barney later

3816
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:20,399
uh drew this picture of what things look

3817
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:21,840
like on board he had a compass

3818
02:46:20,398 --> 02:46:23,278
uh

3819
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:24,960
you know he was

3820
02:46:23,279 --> 02:46:28,319
up this way

3821
02:46:24,959 --> 02:46:30,719
into a room it was a table and cabinet

3822
02:46:28,318 --> 02:46:33,600
this was a circular craft with pie

3823
02:46:30,719 --> 02:46:35,679
shaped room wedges you know going around

3824
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:37,840
it they were not in the same rooms for

3825
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:39,279
their

3826
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:42,639
neither one was witness to what was

3827
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:42,640
going on with the other one

3828
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:51,279
some people have said that betty

3829
02:46:48,799 --> 02:46:54,159
recalled aliens who look very different

3830
02:46:51,279 --> 02:46:56,720
from the ones that barney recalled

3831
02:46:54,159 --> 02:46:59,600
they're getting betty's dreams confused

3832
02:46:56,719 --> 02:47:02,079
with betty's hypnotic recall this is

3833
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:03,760
what the beings looked like in betty's

3834
02:47:02,079 --> 02:47:06,079
dreams

3835
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:08,478
they looked a lot like jimmy durante

3836
02:47:06,079 --> 02:47:11,840
southern european looking dark thick

3837
02:47:08,478 --> 02:47:15,278
hair dark eyebrows human ears

3838
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:17,840
human eyes large noses

3839
02:47:15,279 --> 02:47:20,640
lips that had a bluish tint

3840
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:23,760
and a kind of a grayish skin

3841
02:47:20,639 --> 02:47:27,039
and they were dressed in blue cadet type

3842
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:29,200
uniforms in her dreams

3843
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:32,000
but this is what betty and barney

3844
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:34,319
described and remembered

3845
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,799
during the hypnosis sessions that they

3846
02:47:34,318 --> 02:47:39,519
had with dr simon

3847
02:47:36,799 --> 02:47:41,358
and this is a drawing done by new

3848
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:43,840
hampshire artist uh

3849
02:47:41,359 --> 02:47:47,359
david baker he actually painted this in

3850
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:51,120
watercolors and this was the rendition

3851
02:47:47,359 --> 02:47:53,120
of the leader now david baker

3852
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:56,079
did his drawings based upon his

3853
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:58,079
knowledge of human anatomy so they might

3854
02:47:56,079 --> 02:48:00,799
be slightly different from what betty

3855
02:47:58,079 --> 02:48:03,200
and barney observed betty and barney

3856
02:48:00,799 --> 02:48:05,679
said though that they had large chest

3857
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:09,359
cavities they it was almost as if they

3858
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:12,159
had barrel chest completely round rather

3859
02:48:09,359 --> 02:48:13,840
than being wider this way and thinner

3860
02:48:12,159 --> 02:48:16,398
this way

3861
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:20,239
there was a membrane that covered their

3862
02:48:16,398 --> 02:48:23,278
mouths and this membrane fluttered when

3863
02:48:20,239 --> 02:48:26,079
they spoke to each other in this kind of

3864
02:48:23,279 --> 02:48:28,159
humming or buzzing sound

3865
02:48:26,079 --> 02:48:31,520
but betty and barney

3866
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:34,559
understood them in english although they

3867
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:37,120
never saw their mouths move when they

3868
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:39,920
were communicating with betty and barney

3869
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:42,960
telepathy to me anyway

3870
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:45,520
they had large slanted eyes which betty

3871
02:48:42,959 --> 02:48:46,559
and barney said we had uh sort of square

3872
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:47,520
sides

3873
02:48:46,559 --> 02:48:49,278
and

3874
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:50,479
betty thought they had a vertical

3875
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:54,399
cat-like

3876
02:48:50,478 --> 02:48:57,199
uh slit for a pupil and they both said

3877
02:48:54,398 --> 02:48:58,879
that the iris almost completely filled

3878
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:00,720
up the eye

3879
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:03,839
and there was a little bit of yellow

3880
02:49:00,719 --> 02:49:06,478
around the edges so uh what you see in

3881
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:08,478
and david baker's painting is a little

3882
02:49:06,478 --> 02:49:10,318
bit different from what betty and barney

3883
02:49:08,478 --> 02:49:12,318
actually described in their written

3884
02:49:10,318 --> 02:49:14,639
accounts

3885
02:49:12,318 --> 02:49:16,239
the the leader was approximately five

3886
02:49:14,639 --> 02:49:18,079
feet tall

3887
02:49:16,239 --> 02:49:22,000
and

3888
02:49:18,079 --> 02:49:24,719
let's take a look now at the examiner

3889
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:27,200
this is more what betty and barney

3890
02:49:24,719 --> 02:49:28,318
actually described this painting was

3891
02:49:27,200 --> 02:49:31,760
done by

3892
02:49:28,318 --> 02:49:33,680
new mexico artist patrick richard and he

3893
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:36,719
was actually a friend of betty when he

3894
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:39,120
lived in new hampshire the examiner

3895
02:49:36,719 --> 02:49:43,199
looked about the same as the leader only

3896
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:45,359
they said he or she had a weaker chin

3897
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:47,760
they weren't sure if it would this was a

3898
02:49:45,359 --> 02:49:49,600
male or female

3899
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:51,040
it was approximately four and a half

3900
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:54,399
feet tall

3901
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:56,319
communicated in english again

3902
02:49:54,398 --> 02:49:59,199
they were all dressed in black

3903
02:49:56,318 --> 02:50:02,639
tight-fitting shiny clothing and in

3904
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:03,439
barney's original reports

3905
02:50:02,639 --> 02:50:04,719
to

3906
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:07,439
walter webb

3907
02:50:04,719 --> 02:50:11,599
back in october of 1961

3908
02:50:07,439 --> 02:50:15,040
he described shiny black uniforms

3909
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:19,359
they betty later described long narrow

3910
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:23,840
palms and very long fingers maybe four

3911
02:50:19,359 --> 02:50:23,840
or five she wasn't sure which

3912
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:26,559
this is

3913
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:30,160
a side view

3914
02:50:26,559 --> 02:50:30,159
a sketch by david baker

3915
02:50:30,478 --> 02:50:34,159
and there was a being on board that

3916
02:50:32,639 --> 02:50:36,719
betty and barney

3917
02:50:34,159 --> 02:50:39,520
didn't reveal to the public

3918
02:50:36,719 --> 02:50:42,478
they were asked not to talk about this

3919
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:45,680
particular one by the scientists who

3920
02:50:42,478 --> 02:50:48,799
were studying their case

3921
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:52,000
this is the one i call the supervisor

3922
02:50:48,799 --> 02:50:54,959
because this little being stood out in

3923
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:57,760
the dark hallway looking in at betty as

3924
02:50:54,959 --> 02:51:00,318
she was being examined and frightened

3925
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:02,000
her terribly he was about three and a

3926
02:51:00,318 --> 02:51:05,840
half feet tall

3927
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:07,520
he resembled the others in a in a sense

3928
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:10,559
but he was different

3929
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:13,040
at the same time his head was larger in

3930
02:51:10,559 --> 02:51:15,680
proportion to the size of his body than

3931
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:19,279
the leader and the examiner and he had

3932
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:19,279
this very dark

3933
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:22,719
irises

3934
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:26,319
in his eyes

3935
02:51:22,719 --> 02:51:29,039
he had a broad flat nose and a wide thin

3936
02:51:26,318 --> 02:51:30,318
mouth and he was very hostile and

3937
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:34,720
threatening

3938
02:51:30,318 --> 02:51:36,639
at the end this was the one that took

3939
02:51:34,719 --> 02:51:38,478
the book away from betty if you're

3940
02:51:36,639 --> 02:51:40,398
familiar with the story there was a book

3941
02:51:38,478 --> 02:51:42,719
that she wanted to keep

3942
02:51:40,398 --> 02:51:44,719
uh that she found on the craft it wasn't

3943
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:47,358
didn't look like our books but it was

3944
02:51:44,719 --> 02:51:50,719
like a book and he was the one who saw

3945
02:51:47,359 --> 02:51:54,318
it and she told me that he was almost

3946
02:51:50,719 --> 02:51:55,199
screaming when he saw that she had that

3947
02:51:54,318 --> 02:51:56,879
book

3948
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:59,040
and then

3949
02:51:56,879 --> 02:52:01,199
it was taken away from her she had asked

3950
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:03,439
for something to take with early on to

3951
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:05,680
prove that this event had happened

3952
02:52:03,439 --> 02:52:07,600
and she saw the book grabbed it and

3953
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:09,680
she's getting ready to leave

3954
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:12,399
and this blankety blank is telling me no

3955
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:15,200
you can't take it with you

3956
02:52:12,398 --> 02:52:18,719
i'll remember you won't remember

3957
02:52:15,200 --> 02:52:18,720
it was a nasty scene there

3958
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:24,319
well betty and barney said that their

3959
02:52:21,439 --> 02:52:26,880
physical examinations involved

3960
02:52:24,318 --> 02:52:29,920
an examination of their skeletal

3961
02:52:26,879 --> 02:52:32,318
structures these beings seem to be very

3962
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:35,840
interested in the difference between

3963
02:52:32,318 --> 02:52:38,239
humans skeletons and their own whatever

3964
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:41,359
that might be betty and barney noted

3965
02:52:38,239 --> 02:52:44,398
that they seemed oddly jointed and when

3966
02:52:41,359 --> 02:52:46,720
they walked they walked very differently

3967
02:52:44,398 --> 02:52:49,599
from us it was almost as if they were

3968
02:52:46,719 --> 02:52:52,478
gliding or stumbling along

3969
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:55,680
or almost skating

3970
02:52:52,478 --> 02:52:58,719
it's really hard to describe

3971
02:52:55,680 --> 02:53:02,479
they examined betty's and barney's hands

3972
02:52:58,719 --> 02:53:05,119
their feet they took their shoes off

3973
02:53:02,478 --> 02:53:07,760
they examined their joints to see how

3974
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:09,200
human joints moved they looked into

3975
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:11,680
their eyes

3976
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:14,560
they scraped their skin

3977
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:16,800
they looked into their mouths

3978
02:53:14,559 --> 02:53:18,799
there were reproductive

3979
02:53:16,799 --> 02:53:21,920
experiments done

3980
02:53:18,799 --> 02:53:22,879
probably a needle was placed in betty's

3981
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:26,239
navel

3982
02:53:22,879 --> 02:53:27,278
and the cup was placed over barney's

3983
02:53:26,239 --> 02:53:29,840
groin

3984
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:31,920
many specimens were taken

3985
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:35,520
from all of the

3986
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:35,520
orifices in their bodies

3987
02:53:36,239 --> 02:53:43,119
and this is betty on the examining table

3988
02:53:40,079 --> 02:53:44,000
uh painting done by patrick richard

3989
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:47,439
again

3990
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:49,920
and the needle in the navel experiment

3991
02:53:47,439 --> 02:53:53,840
and i want to play for you now

3992
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:53,840
betty's description under hypnosis

3993
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:08,240
they rolled me over

3994
02:54:08,799 --> 02:54:11,840
on my back

3995
02:54:14,840 --> 02:54:18,880
[Applause]

3996
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:21,600
and the examiner

3997
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:24,239
had a long needle

3998
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:26,559
in his hand

3999
02:54:24,239 --> 02:54:28,318
and i see the needle

4000
02:54:26,559 --> 02:54:30,159
and it's

4001
02:54:28,318 --> 02:54:31,760
this bigger than any needle i've ever

4002
02:54:30,159 --> 02:54:33,520
seen

4003
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:35,680
and

4004
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:37,760
i asked him what he's going to do with

4005
02:54:35,680 --> 02:54:37,760
it

4006
02:54:38,159 --> 02:54:41,680
and he said just as simple

4007
02:54:42,639 --> 02:54:46,719
and i asked him what

4008
02:54:44,879 --> 02:54:48,879
and he said he just wanted to put it in

4009
02:54:46,719 --> 02:54:48,879
my

4010
02:54:52,850 --> 02:54:59,030
[Applause]

4011
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:17,079
you know

4012
02:55:20,398 --> 02:55:24,159
he goes over and he

4013
02:55:22,318 --> 02:55:28,478
puts his hand

4014
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:28,478
right his hand in front of my eyes

4015
02:55:28,879 --> 02:55:32,509
and he says i'll be all right

4016
02:55:30,879 --> 02:55:35,588
i won't feel it

4017
02:55:32,510 --> 02:55:35,588
[Applause]

4018
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:42,720
and all the pain goes away

4019
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:48,079
just a simple walk in the supermarket

4020
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:51,600
you can tell that

4021
02:55:48,079 --> 02:55:54,000
this is a session in which dr simon had

4022
02:55:51,600 --> 02:55:57,840
to end the session early due to the

4023
02:55:54,000 --> 02:56:01,520
emotional intensity he didn't want to

4024
02:55:57,840 --> 02:56:04,478
cause betty to relive any further trauma

4025
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:06,560
during that session

4026
02:56:04,478 --> 02:56:10,519
and by the way that was before the

4027
02:56:06,559 --> 02:56:10,519
development of amniocentesis

4028
02:56:10,959 --> 02:56:17,199
they did say it was a pregnancy test

4029
02:56:14,398 --> 02:56:19,920
which didn't make any sense at the time

4030
02:56:17,200 --> 02:56:22,880
my wife has had amniocentesis the needle

4031
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:26,799
in the navel routine

4032
02:56:22,879 --> 02:56:27,599
nobody was doing it at this time

4033
02:56:26,799 --> 02:56:30,239
now

4034
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:33,120
uh i have another tape that i want to

4035
02:56:30,239 --> 02:56:34,959
play before stan

4036
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:35,840
talks to you again

4037
02:56:34,959 --> 02:56:39,398
so

4038
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:39,398
let's play this

4039
02:56:39,729 --> 02:56:42,959
[Applause]

4040
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:45,520
he went

4041
02:56:42,959 --> 02:56:45,519
over

4042
02:56:46,159 --> 02:56:49,359
across the room

4043
02:56:49,600 --> 02:56:54,040
to the head of the table

4044
02:56:54,478 --> 02:56:58,478
and

4045
02:56:55,600 --> 02:57:01,040
though he he did something

4046
02:56:58,478 --> 02:57:03,119
he opened up up

4047
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:06,479
and wasn't like a draw

4048
02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:08,640
he said i did something in the metal or

4049
02:57:06,478 --> 02:57:11,599
the wall

4050
02:57:08,639 --> 02:57:12,559
there was an opening

4051
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:15,840
and

4052
02:57:12,559 --> 02:57:15,840
he pulled out a map

4053
02:57:18,719 --> 02:57:22,559
and

4054
02:57:20,159 --> 02:57:27,200
he asked me

4055
02:57:22,559 --> 02:57:27,199
had i ever seen a map like this before

4056
02:57:27,279 --> 02:57:32,720
and i walked

4057
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:32,720
across the room

4058
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:37,840
and i leaned against the table and i

4059
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:37,840
looked at it

4060
02:57:38,318 --> 02:57:45,039
and it was a map of

4061
02:57:40,639 --> 02:57:45,039
it was an oblong map

4062
02:57:47,439 --> 02:57:53,680
the rhythm square

4063
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:54,880
it was a lot wider than it was long

4064
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:56,559
and

4065
02:57:54,879 --> 02:57:59,679
there were always

4066
02:57:56,559 --> 02:57:59,680
dots so much

4067
02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:07,059
and they were together all over at some

4068
02:58:06,559 --> 02:58:09,039
level

4069
02:58:07,059 --> 02:58:12,639
[Applause]

4070
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:17,000
just pin points and others were

4071
02:58:12,639 --> 02:58:17,000
as big as a nickel

4072
02:58:18,559 --> 02:58:22,478
and there were lines

4073
02:58:22,750 --> 02:58:25,359
[Applause]

4074
02:58:24,239 --> 02:58:27,439
there were

4075
02:58:25,359 --> 02:58:28,860
on some of the

4076
02:58:27,439 --> 02:58:29,920
dots that there were

4077
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:33,840
[Applause]

4078
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:37,600
curved lines going from

4079
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:37,600
one dot to another

4080
02:58:38,639 --> 02:58:41,039
and

4081
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:44,000
there was

4082
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:45,040
one big circle

4083
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,760
and

4084
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:53,120
it had

4085
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:55,600
a lot of lines coming out from it

4086
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:58,720
a lot of lines going to

4087
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:58,720
another circle

4088
02:58:58,799 --> 02:59:04,879
quite close

4089
02:59:01,279 --> 02:59:04,880
but not as big

4090
02:59:05,279 --> 02:59:07,520
and

4091
02:59:06,079 --> 02:59:10,398
these were

4092
02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:10,399
heavy lines

4093
02:59:10,559 --> 02:59:15,119
and i asked him

4094
02:59:12,559 --> 02:59:18,079
what they meant

4095
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:18,079
and he said that

4096
02:59:18,478 --> 02:59:24,398
the heavy lines were trade routes

4097
02:59:23,239 --> 02:59:25,600
[Applause]

4098
02:59:24,398 --> 02:59:29,239
and then

4099
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:29,239
the other ones

4100
02:59:30,079 --> 02:59:34,879
the other one is that the solid lines

4101
02:59:33,250 --> 02:59:35,760
[Applause]

4102
02:59:34,879 --> 02:59:40,278
were

4103
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:40,279
places they went occasionally

4104
02:59:41,359 --> 02:59:45,600
he said that

4105
02:59:43,360 --> 02:59:48,399
[Applause]

4106
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:51,800
the birthing lines

4107
02:59:48,398 --> 02:59:51,799
were expeditions

4108
02:59:52,129 --> 02:59:57,839
[Applause]

4109
02:59:54,478 --> 02:59:57,840
so i asked him

4110
02:59:58,879 --> 03:00:02,719
where he

4111
03:00:00,478 --> 03:00:02,719
what

4112
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:06,720
where was his home port

4113
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:11,840
and

4114
03:00:08,879 --> 03:00:16,000
he said

4115
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:16,000
where are you on this map

4116
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:21,439
and

4117
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:24,880
[Applause]

4118
03:00:21,439 --> 03:00:27,040
i reluctant i laughed and i said i don't

4119
03:00:24,879 --> 03:00:27,039
know

4120
03:00:28,799 --> 03:00:33,519
so he said well then

4121
03:00:32,079 --> 03:00:36,559
if you don't know

4122
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:39,279
where you were

4123
03:00:36,559 --> 03:00:43,680
there wouldn't be any point

4124
03:00:39,279 --> 03:00:43,680
of my telling you where i am

4125
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:49,680
wise guy alien is all i can say this was

4126
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:51,439
preceded by betty asking him where they

4127
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:53,200
were from

4128
03:00:51,439 --> 03:00:56,398
and saying i know you're not from around

4129
03:00:53,200 --> 03:00:58,560
here the understatement of the month

4130
03:00:56,398 --> 03:01:00,159
and that's when he showed her this this

4131
03:00:58,559 --> 03:01:03,680
map

4132
03:01:00,159 --> 03:01:06,559
and so this was followed by

4133
03:01:03,680 --> 03:01:09,040
dr simon is listening to this under

4134
03:01:06,559 --> 03:01:10,879
hypnosis this is reliving it's not

4135
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:13,520
retelling

4136
03:01:10,879 --> 03:01:15,759
and he asked betty i mean you can

4137
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:17,760
imagine how dr simon felt there he's got

4138
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:19,600
a sensible person telling him a story

4139
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:21,359
about trade routes and occasional

4140
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:23,760
expeditions and

4141
03:01:21,359 --> 03:01:25,600
you know where is this all coming from

4142
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:28,318
and so he asked but if she can remember

4143
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:30,720
what the map looks like she says yes and

4144
03:01:28,318 --> 03:01:32,639
he gives her a post-hypnotic suggestion

4145
03:01:30,719 --> 03:01:35,760
if and only if she can remember it

4146
03:01:32,639 --> 03:01:37,840
accurately please draw it later on

4147
03:01:35,760 --> 03:01:38,960
and she does she goes home and she draws

4148
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:40,478
it

4149
03:01:38,959 --> 03:01:42,318
and

4150
03:01:40,478 --> 03:01:43,039
there it is

4151
03:01:42,318 --> 03:01:46,318
and

4152
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:48,640
base stars and you know trade routes and

4153
03:01:46,318 --> 03:01:49,920
occasional expeditions

4154
03:01:48,639 --> 03:01:51,519
how the heck are you going to make any

4155
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:54,559
sense out of that

4156
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:56,880
i mean a galaxy has a 100 200 billion

4157
03:01:54,559 --> 03:01:58,719
stars in it we have no points of

4158
03:01:56,879 --> 03:02:00,959
reference it might suggest that the

4159
03:01:58,719 --> 03:02:03,278
earth was on there or the sun was on

4160
03:02:00,959 --> 03:02:05,519
here somewhere because they're here

4161
03:02:03,279 --> 03:02:06,720
but beyond that we'll never know so it

4162
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:08,880
seemed

4163
03:02:06,719 --> 03:02:10,799
until a brilliant woman named marjorie

4164
03:02:08,879 --> 03:02:11,839
fish did something nobody else had ever

4165
03:02:10,799 --> 03:02:14,398
done

4166
03:02:11,840 --> 03:02:16,079
she built 26 different three-dimensional

4167
03:02:14,398 --> 03:02:18,079
models of our local galactic

4168
03:02:16,079 --> 03:02:20,398
neighborhood that's marjorie that's

4169
03:02:18,079 --> 03:02:23,359
really me i did have black hair a long

4170
03:02:20,398 --> 03:02:25,519
time ago this is in the early 70s

4171
03:02:23,359 --> 03:02:28,159
she was a school teacher

4172
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:30,479
she built these models

4173
03:02:28,159 --> 03:02:32,159
her whole point was to see if she could

4174
03:02:30,478 --> 03:02:33,519
she had visited betty and gotten more

4175
03:02:32,159 --> 03:02:34,559
information

4176
03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:36,560
to see if she could find a

4177
03:02:34,559 --> 03:02:38,318
three-dimensional pattern

4178
03:02:36,559 --> 03:02:40,000
that matched the two-dimensional drawing

4179
03:02:38,318 --> 03:02:42,559
that betty had drawn

4180
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:44,398
she thought she'd find many matches

4181
03:02:42,559 --> 03:02:46,159
at first she didn't find any

4182
03:02:44,398 --> 03:02:48,079
now her models were limited by

4183
03:02:46,159 --> 03:02:51,119
information on how the distance to the

4184
03:02:48,079 --> 03:02:52,559
stars and how many you can put in a

4185
03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:54,960
model

4186
03:02:52,559 --> 03:02:58,079
out about 50 light years was the most

4187
03:02:54,959 --> 03:02:59,839
you could get in a cube kind of thing

4188
03:02:58,079 --> 03:03:01,439
she expected to find many matches she

4189
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:03,680
didn't find any

4190
03:03:01,439 --> 03:03:05,359
using all the stars

4191
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:07,760
then she started cutting back on which

4192
03:03:05,359 --> 03:03:09,680
stars she showed getting to the kind

4193
03:03:07,760 --> 03:03:13,120
that scientists then said were the ones

4194
03:03:09,680 --> 03:03:14,639
that ought to have planets in life maybe

4195
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:16,640
not all stars would be expected they

4196
03:03:14,639 --> 03:03:19,680
might be too old too new to have another

4197
03:03:16,639 --> 03:03:20,799
star too close all kinds of restrictions

4198
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:23,040
finally

4199
03:03:20,799 --> 03:03:24,478
when she got some good distance data the

4200
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:26,000
astronomers aren't going anywhere so

4201
03:03:24,478 --> 03:03:26,799
they don't care how far away the stars

4202
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,159
are

4203
03:03:26,799 --> 03:03:31,438
you need two

4204
03:03:28,159 --> 03:03:32,879
two angles to find a star

4205
03:03:31,439 --> 03:03:36,159
and whether it's 20 light years away or

4206
03:03:32,879 --> 03:03:37,199
40 light years away doesn't matter

4207
03:03:36,159 --> 03:03:39,119
but if you're trying to get a

4208
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:40,720
three-dimensional pattern of where

4209
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:43,760
things come from

4210
03:03:40,719 --> 03:03:45,840
it the distances matter entirely

4211
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:48,318
and when a new catalog came out that

4212
03:03:45,840 --> 03:03:50,960
finally wilhelm gleese new catalog of

4213
03:03:48,318 --> 03:03:52,478
nearby star distances you heard the word

4214
03:03:50,959 --> 03:03:54,318
gliese

4215
03:03:52,478 --> 03:03:58,879
three weeks ago there was talk about a

4216
03:03:54,318 --> 03:04:00,719
planet 581 g gliese 581g

4217
03:03:58,879 --> 03:04:03,039
that's the same gliese

4218
03:04:00,719 --> 03:04:05,599
the star is 581

4219
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:07,840
the g refers to the fifth plan i guess

4220
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:09,120
it's fifth or sixth planet around that

4221
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:10,799
star

4222
03:04:09,120 --> 03:04:12,240
and this may be in the goldilocks zone

4223
03:04:10,799 --> 03:04:14,879
and may have planets in life and all

4224
03:04:12,239 --> 03:04:17,359
this may have life

4225
03:04:14,879 --> 03:04:20,719
uh anyway

4226
03:04:17,359 --> 03:04:22,479
she finally found one and only one

4227
03:04:20,719 --> 03:04:24,799
pattern that matched

4228
03:04:22,478 --> 03:04:27,519
angle for line angle line length for

4229
03:04:24,799 --> 03:04:29,840
line length what betty had drawn it was

4230
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:31,279
a big moment this is one of her models

4231
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:32,719
each of those beads stands for a

4232
03:04:31,279 --> 03:04:36,000
particular star in its proper

4233
03:04:32,719 --> 03:04:38,559
three-dimensional location

4234
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:40,719
and she had help from the staff at ohio

4235
03:04:38,559 --> 03:04:43,278
state university astronomy department dr

4236
03:04:40,719 --> 03:04:45,039
mitchell he's in my movie ufos are real

4237
03:04:43,279 --> 03:04:46,479
saying how accurate her work was she was

4238
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:47,760
a school teacher she was a member of

4239
03:04:46,478 --> 03:04:51,599
mensah

4240
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:53,279
brilliant objective person marjorie was

4241
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:55,200
and

4242
03:04:53,279 --> 03:04:58,239
this is the identity of those stars the

4243
03:04:55,200 --> 03:05:00,479
distances then aren't quite accurate

4244
03:04:58,239 --> 03:05:01,760
the hipparcos satellite has made

4245
03:05:00,478 --> 03:05:02,840
millions of measurements of better

4246
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:05,520
distances

4247
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:07,600
finally uh the sun is up here that's the

4248
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:09,920
important thing our star

4249
03:05:07,600 --> 03:05:13,439
the base stars

4250
03:05:09,920 --> 03:05:15,040
zeta 1 and zeta 2 reticuli

4251
03:05:13,439 --> 03:05:16,880
that's the constellation of reticulum

4252
03:05:15,040 --> 03:05:18,080
which means the net

4253
03:05:16,879 --> 03:05:20,398
you can't see it from here you've got to

4254
03:05:18,079 --> 03:05:21,680
go down to the southern hemisphere to

4255
03:05:20,398 --> 03:05:24,079
see it

4256
03:05:21,680 --> 03:05:26,239
these two stars are very special they're

4257
03:05:24,079 --> 03:05:28,159
the closest to each other pair of

4258
03:05:26,239 --> 03:05:29,279
sun-like stars in our entire local

4259
03:05:28,159 --> 03:05:30,959
neighborhood

4260
03:05:29,279 --> 03:05:34,239
our star the sun

4261
03:05:30,959 --> 03:05:36,879
is out in the boondocks next star over

4262
03:05:34,239 --> 03:05:39,520
4.3 light years away these two stars

4263
03:05:36,879 --> 03:05:41,358
from each other are only an eighth of a

4264
03:05:39,520 --> 03:05:44,079
light year apart

4265
03:05:41,359 --> 03:05:45,520
that's 30 times closer to each other

4266
03:05:44,079 --> 03:05:46,799
than we are to the next star over we're

4267
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:48,800
out in the boonies these guys got

4268
03:05:46,799 --> 03:05:51,358
next-door neighbors

4269
03:05:48,799 --> 03:05:54,719
and those two stars are at least a

4270
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:56,079
billion years older than the sun

4271
03:05:54,719 --> 03:05:57,760
a billion years now the fact that

4272
03:05:56,079 --> 03:05:59,039
they're so close means from a planet

4273
03:05:57,760 --> 03:06:01,279
around one looking at the other it's

4274
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:02,960
visible all day long

4275
03:06:01,279 --> 03:06:05,040
and with that billion years and that

4276
03:06:02,959 --> 03:06:07,358
short distances is plenty of time and

4277
03:06:05,040 --> 03:06:09,439
more incentive to develop interstellar

4278
03:06:07,359 --> 03:06:11,920
travel a long time ago you got a

4279
03:06:09,439 --> 03:06:13,520
next-door neighbor and you can tell

4280
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:15,040
because you're so close

4281
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:16,319
that there's life of some kind around

4282
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:17,840
the other star

4283
03:06:16,318 --> 03:06:19,119
around the planets around the other

4284
03:06:17,840 --> 03:06:21,760
stars

4285
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:23,439
so it's a very exciting discovery

4286
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:25,040
now the city people will tell you we

4287
03:06:23,439 --> 03:06:27,439
listened to those stars and we didn't

4288
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:29,600
get a signal

4289
03:06:27,439 --> 03:06:31,439
seti really stands for silly effort to

4290
03:06:29,600 --> 03:06:33,439
investigate

4291
03:06:31,439 --> 03:06:35,279
uh to suggest that aliens are stuck at

4292
03:06:33,439 --> 03:06:37,359
our level of radio communication

4293
03:06:35,279 --> 03:06:38,319
technology we've had for about a hundred

4294
03:06:37,359 --> 03:06:40,079
years

4295
03:06:38,318 --> 03:06:43,119
is pretty silly

4296
03:06:40,079 --> 03:06:45,840
i don't use a slide rule anymore

4297
03:06:43,120 --> 03:06:48,960
uh i doubt if aliens are using our

4298
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:50,639
communication technology now

4299
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:52,879
but this is your target if you want to

4300
03:06:50,639 --> 03:06:55,358
go someplace they're only 39.3 light

4301
03:06:52,879 --> 03:06:57,438
years away from here

4302
03:06:55,359 --> 03:06:59,680
so that's in the local neighborhood now

4303
03:06:57,439 --> 03:07:02,000
several special things

4304
03:06:59,680 --> 03:07:04,239
all the stars connected by lines are

4305
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:06,959
sun-like stars it's only true of five

4306
03:07:04,239 --> 03:07:08,719
percent of the stars in our neighborhood

4307
03:07:06,959 --> 03:07:11,119
is between a thousand and two thousand

4308
03:07:08,719 --> 03:07:13,599
stars within 55 light years we keep

4309
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:16,240
finding new small stars

4310
03:07:13,600 --> 03:07:18,239
that's the first thing all the pattern

4311
03:07:16,239 --> 03:07:19,359
stars are sun-like even though five only

4312
03:07:18,239 --> 03:07:21,920
five percent of the stars in the

4313
03:07:19,359 --> 03:07:24,880
neighborhood are sunlight

4314
03:07:21,920 --> 03:07:27,200
and all the sun-like stars

4315
03:07:24,879 --> 03:07:29,759
in that very well

4316
03:07:27,200 --> 03:07:31,040
described hunk of space are part of the

4317
03:07:29,760 --> 03:07:32,880
pattern

4318
03:07:31,040 --> 03:07:34,479
the chance of that being a coincidence

4319
03:07:32,879 --> 03:07:35,759
are one in ten thousand to one in a

4320
03:07:34,478 --> 03:07:38,159
million

4321
03:07:35,760 --> 03:07:41,279
they're all in a plane the stars

4322
03:07:38,159 --> 03:07:44,239
connected by lines like slices of

4323
03:07:41,279 --> 03:07:46,159
pepperoni on a pizza big flat pizza

4324
03:07:44,239 --> 03:07:48,398
as opposed to raisins in a big fat loaf

4325
03:07:46,159 --> 03:07:50,000
of raisin bread that makes transport a

4326
03:07:48,398 --> 03:07:51,840
lot easier when you're in a plane the

4327
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:54,000
planets in the solar system are in a

4328
03:07:51,840 --> 03:07:56,000
plane

4329
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,719
amazingly

4330
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:59,120
so

4331
03:07:56,719 --> 03:08:00,799
there you go it's a very exciting

4332
03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:03,200
challenging work i'm very proud to have

4333
03:08:00,799 --> 03:08:05,438
been the first to publish about it

4334
03:08:03,200 --> 03:08:06,880
i was asked to help marjorie by the head

4335
03:08:05,439 --> 03:08:08,318
of the aerial phenomena research

4336
03:08:06,879 --> 03:08:10,000
organization that's how i got involved i

4337
03:08:08,318 --> 03:08:11,680
met with her a couple of times three

4338
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:13,040
times anyway

4339
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:14,639
uh

4340
03:08:13,040 --> 03:08:16,160
very exciting piece of work and she's

4341
03:08:14,639 --> 03:08:19,398
one of the most objective people i've

4342
03:08:16,159 --> 03:08:19,398
ever met

4343
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:25,760
now here's that question about the book

4344
03:08:24,079 --> 03:08:28,159
that we mentioned earlier

4345
03:08:25,760 --> 03:08:30,960
about the nasty supervisor

4346
03:08:28,159 --> 03:08:32,398
taking it away from her

4347
03:08:30,959 --> 03:08:34,478
here's what betty said the book seemed

4348
03:08:32,398 --> 03:08:36,478
to be constructed of thin stiff shiny

4349
03:08:34,478 --> 03:08:38,799
plastic maybe an inch thick tuck seemed

4350
03:08:36,478 --> 03:08:41,679
to be embedded in the plastic it was in

4351
03:08:38,799 --> 03:08:44,239
about six columns going down

4352
03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:48,159
with symbols what those symbols mean i

4353
03:08:44,239 --> 03:08:49,359
don't know can we decode them i doubt it

4354
03:08:48,159 --> 03:08:51,439
we don't have this is one of those

4355
03:08:49,359 --> 03:08:54,479
places where you wish dr simon had asked

4356
03:08:51,439 --> 03:08:55,840
for more information please you know

4357
03:08:54,478 --> 03:08:59,760
but he didn't

4358
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:59,760
but it was something different anyway

4359
03:09:00,398 --> 03:09:06,079
let's get back to the comparative

4360
03:09:02,639 --> 03:09:08,559
analysis i did on the hypnosis tapes

4361
03:09:06,079 --> 03:09:11,920
where i transcribed betty's and barney's

4362
03:09:08,559 --> 03:09:14,239
statements and lined them up

4363
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:18,159
and compared them to betty's statements

4364
03:09:14,239 --> 03:09:20,639
in her dream and although i have several

4365
03:09:18,159 --> 03:09:23,680
examples in the book

4366
03:09:20,639 --> 03:09:25,840
this i'm using only two examples here

4367
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:28,318
due to our time constraint

4368
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:31,439
but uh in betty's dream she said that

4369
03:09:28,318 --> 03:09:33,760
she and barney returned to the car at

4370
03:09:31,439 --> 03:09:37,920
the same time they stood by the side of

4371
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:39,840
the car and they watched the ufo leave

4372
03:09:37,920 --> 03:09:42,159
then they entered the vehicle

4373
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:43,359
and they

4374
03:09:42,159 --> 03:09:44,478
took off

4375
03:09:43,359 --> 03:09:45,760
well

4376
03:09:44,478 --> 03:09:46,639
let's go back

4377
03:09:45,760 --> 03:09:48,800
uh

4378
03:09:46,639 --> 03:09:50,318
that's not what happened on the hypnosis

4379
03:09:48,799 --> 03:09:52,879
tapes

4380
03:09:50,318 --> 03:09:55,600
in on the hypnosis tapes barney was

4381
03:09:52,879 --> 03:09:58,238
escorted to the car first

4382
03:09:55,600 --> 03:10:00,720
he was placed in the driver's seat when

4383
03:09:58,238 --> 03:10:02,478
he and he sat on his gun

4384
03:10:00,719 --> 03:10:05,358
he was sitting there wondering where

4385
03:10:02,478 --> 03:10:06,478
betty was and he saw her coming down the

4386
03:10:05,359 --> 03:10:08,640
path

4387
03:10:06,478 --> 03:10:11,519
betty had actually been back on the

4388
03:10:08,639 --> 03:10:12,639
craft arguing because she wanted to keep

4389
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:14,560
that book

4390
03:10:12,639 --> 03:10:17,358
and she was furious

4391
03:10:14,559 --> 03:10:19,600
that she it had been taken away from her

4392
03:10:17,359 --> 03:10:21,520
she was feisty

4393
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:24,880
and then the leader took her down the

4394
03:10:21,520 --> 03:10:27,600
path and she entered the car she picked

4395
03:10:24,879 --> 03:10:30,238
up her dog the leader had told her that

4396
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:32,559
she could stop she could stand by the

4397
03:10:30,238 --> 03:10:35,119
side of the car and watch the craft

4398
03:10:32,559 --> 03:10:38,000
leave uh he thought it would be safe for

4399
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:40,479
them to do that so then

4400
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:42,719
she asked bonnie to get out of the car

4401
03:10:40,478 --> 03:10:45,438
and watch the craft leave which they did

4402
03:10:42,719 --> 03:10:47,599
so this was completely different from

4403
03:10:45,439 --> 03:10:50,318
the information that betty had recorded

4404
03:10:47,600 --> 03:10:52,720
in her dreams uh indicating that it

4405
03:10:50,318 --> 03:10:54,799
might have been a real experience and

4406
03:10:52,719 --> 03:10:57,519
not that betty had simply repeated her

4407
03:10:54,799 --> 03:11:00,559
dreams under hypnosis and that barney

4408
03:10:57,520 --> 03:11:03,040
had somehow absorbed the information in

4409
03:11:00,559 --> 03:11:05,920
betty's dream osmosis

4410
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:05,920
and repeated it

4411
03:11:06,478 --> 03:11:12,398
and so after many attempts to find the

4412
03:11:10,159 --> 03:11:14,959
location dr simon had given a suggestion

4413
03:11:12,398 --> 03:11:16,959
that they would find the location

4414
03:11:14,959 --> 03:11:20,238
they did find it

4415
03:11:16,959 --> 03:11:23,519
in this area this is an aerial view

4416
03:11:20,238 --> 03:11:26,079
this is a dark at night

4417
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:28,960
lonely road no lights

4418
03:11:26,079 --> 03:11:31,279
and there's now a house here

4419
03:11:28,959 --> 03:11:32,959
uh there wasn't then

4420
03:11:31,279 --> 03:11:34,960
and it's sandy and they recalled the

4421
03:11:32,959 --> 03:11:38,000
soil being sandy and it's the only place

4422
03:11:34,959 --> 03:11:39,358
around that's like this

4423
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,719
so they're satisfied the people who live

4424
03:11:39,359 --> 03:11:42,318
in the house didn't know about this

4425
03:11:40,719 --> 03:11:44,318
being the place where this experience

4426
03:11:42,318 --> 03:11:45,039
had taken place incidentally

4427
03:11:44,318 --> 03:11:48,719
but

4428
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:50,640
when you're out here as we were at night

4429
03:11:48,719 --> 03:11:51,599
in the dark

4430
03:11:50,639 --> 03:11:54,559
uh

4431
03:11:51,600 --> 03:11:56,880
it's a closed-in sort of place

4432
03:11:54,559 --> 03:12:00,000
i mean the trees are tall

4433
03:11:56,879 --> 03:12:01,039
they're not little scrubby things

4434
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,879
and so

4435
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:04,399
it's a unique location you can see

4436
03:12:02,879 --> 03:12:06,398
looking around there there aren't any

4437
03:12:04,398 --> 03:12:08,799
other places in the woods

4438
03:12:06,398 --> 03:12:10,799
uh this is not a place for spectators in

4439
03:12:08,799 --> 03:12:13,759
other words the guys who ran the show

4440
03:12:10,799 --> 03:12:13,759
knew what they were doing

4441
03:12:15,840 --> 03:12:22,719
this is betty standing on the site

4442
03:12:18,799 --> 03:12:22,719
before the house was built obviously

4443
03:12:24,159 --> 03:12:27,600
they went on home

4444
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:30,000
you can see the distances on the map

4445
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:33,840
here 37 miles to concord

4446
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:36,238
from here at 17 47 miles to portsmouth

4447
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:38,559
and people have said oh they got lost on

4448
03:12:36,238 --> 03:12:40,799
mountain roads

4449
03:12:38,559 --> 03:12:43,680
there aren't many roads

4450
03:12:40,799 --> 03:12:46,559
uh around the area there's no way

4451
03:12:43,680 --> 03:12:49,040
kathy tried to get lost she didn't

4452
03:12:46,559 --> 03:12:49,039
succeed

4453
03:12:49,439 --> 03:12:54,479
if they had traveled along route 3 it

4454
03:12:51,760 --> 03:12:57,520
would have been only 16 miles

4455
03:12:54,478 --> 03:12:59,679
from the field the close encounter field

4456
03:12:57,520 --> 03:13:02,238
to plymouth new hampshire if they had

4457
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:05,359
traveled on route 175

4458
03:13:02,238 --> 03:13:07,920
it would have been 21 miles

4459
03:13:05,359 --> 03:13:11,520
there's no way to account for that two

4460
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:11,520
hours of missing time

4461
03:13:12,398 --> 03:13:16,719
they were uh give you an idea of their

4462
03:13:14,639 --> 03:13:17,840
involvement in the community barney was

4463
03:13:16,719 --> 03:13:19,119
on the governor's civil rights

4464
03:13:17,840 --> 03:13:21,840
commission

4465
03:13:19,120 --> 03:13:24,960
uh very active in politics betty was

4466
03:13:21,840 --> 03:13:27,600
active in politics

4467
03:13:24,959 --> 03:13:29,119
they got invited to the inauguration of

4468
03:13:27,600 --> 03:13:32,318
lyndon johnson

4469
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:35,040
january 20th 1965.

4470
03:13:32,318 --> 03:13:37,119
and kathy here went with them she got an

4471
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:39,520
invitation too

4472
03:13:37,120 --> 03:13:41,439
so what the point of this is is not to

4473
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:45,279
brag about that we're talking about

4474
03:13:41,439 --> 03:13:47,279
upstanding citizens of the community

4475
03:13:45,279 --> 03:13:49,359
these are not people who were looking

4476
03:13:47,279 --> 03:13:51,600
how can we make up a story and have a

4477
03:13:49,359 --> 03:13:53,680
crummy book put out and make a lot of

4478
03:13:51,600 --> 03:13:55,040
money this is not what we're talking

4479
03:13:53,680 --> 03:13:56,398
about here

4480
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:59,200
these were people who had everything to

4481
03:13:56,398 --> 03:14:02,000
lose and nothing to gain by going public

4482
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:02,000
against their will

4483
03:14:02,238 --> 03:14:06,478
there's barney with senator mcintyre of

4484
03:14:04,879 --> 03:14:09,438
new hampshire

4485
03:14:06,478 --> 03:14:10,799
at the inauguration

4486
03:14:09,439 --> 03:14:12,720
there's he's appointed to the new

4487
03:14:10,799 --> 03:14:15,119
hampshire state advisory committee on

4488
03:14:12,719 --> 03:14:17,438
civil rights commission

4489
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:19,040
this is respectability

4490
03:14:17,439 --> 03:14:20,559
and remember those were difficult days

4491
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:22,479
in the civil rights movement you may

4492
03:14:20,559 --> 03:14:23,278
remember the early 60s there was a lot

4493
03:14:22,478 --> 03:14:26,398
of

4494
03:14:23,279 --> 03:14:28,880
foment a lot of stuff going on

4495
03:14:26,398 --> 03:14:32,000
this is them in 1965 with that first

4496
03:14:28,879 --> 03:14:34,318
newspaper article

4497
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:36,238
which started the whole ball rolling

4498
03:14:34,318 --> 03:14:38,639
unfortunately or not whatever you want

4499
03:14:36,238 --> 03:14:38,639
to say

4500
03:14:38,879 --> 03:14:43,599
through a violation of confidentiality

4501
03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:45,200
and against their will

4502
03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:47,040
the story is told in the book in great

4503
03:14:45,200 --> 03:14:50,239
detail but

4504
03:14:47,040 --> 03:14:52,319
there they are with delsi in 1966

4505
03:14:50,238 --> 03:14:53,920
they had at that point agreed to tell

4506
03:14:52,318 --> 03:14:56,159
the full story

4507
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:58,879

03:15:04,639 --> 03:15:07,920
that dr simon would have final say on

4513
03:15:06,559 --> 03:15:10,318
everything

4514
03:15:07,920 --> 03:15:13,520

03:15:13,520 --> 03:15:18,000
in the original manuscript and

4517
03:15:15,520 --> 03:15:21,840
simon's comments on the manuscript

4518
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:21,840

4520
03:15:24,478 --> 03:15:28,398
chapters on the psycho physics

4521
03:15:26,478 --> 03:15:31,358
experiments that betty agreed to

4522
03:15:28,398 --> 03:15:34,799
participate in with robert homan and c.d

4523
03:15:31,359 --> 03:15:36,880
jackson who were two employees

4524
03:15:34,799 --> 03:15:40,639
at ibm

4525
03:15:36,879 --> 03:15:42,959
robert homan was a writer and c.d

4526
03:15:40,639 --> 03:15:45,840
jackson was a senior engineer

4527
03:15:42,959 --> 03:15:49,199
and betty had agreed to do psycho psycho

4528
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:51,359
physics experiments call them in

4529
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:54,720
try to call them in with with some

4530
03:15:51,359 --> 03:15:56,800
limited success you will see

4531
03:15:54,719 --> 03:16:00,000
betty also went out she was trying to

4532
03:15:56,799 --> 03:16:01,278
vector in craft

4533
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:03,600
this was

4534
03:16:01,279 --> 03:16:06,560
photograph taken years later after

4535
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:09,359
barney's death in 1969

4536
03:16:06,559 --> 03:16:12,079
and we don't really know what this is

4537
03:16:09,359 --> 03:16:14,840
but betty found it interesting you can

4538
03:16:12,079 --> 03:16:19,359
see the shape here it hovered above her

4539
03:16:14,840 --> 03:16:22,238
vehicle this photograph is enlarged

4540
03:16:19,359 --> 03:16:25,120
on the original slide there appears to

4541
03:16:22,238 --> 03:16:27,520
be someone standing in this window

4542
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:30,239
that doesn't show up well here

4543
03:16:27,520 --> 03:16:31,600
she also took this photograph of a fiery

4544
03:16:30,238 --> 03:16:33,760
orb we

4545
03:16:31,600 --> 03:16:36,399
don't know what that is either

4546
03:16:33,760 --> 03:16:38,478
and now we've come to the end and this

4547
03:16:36,398 --> 03:16:41,278
is our book captured the betty and

4548
