1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,040
and do some you know find the recessive

2
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:11,099
trades you know markers on what every

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,439
leaf is and you select data points you

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,179
collect as much as you can on terp

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,378
profiles and noses and stuff like that

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,539
but you can be a pollen Checker and

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,100
still do that stuff too yeah but uh you

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,960
know it's like you're actually so

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,220
breeders actually are Fina Hunters I

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,000
think that's the biggest part too your

11
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:28,739
Fino and genotype uh you know hunting

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,079
goes on and you basically have to go

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,699
through and get your nose on stuff you

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,500
have to get dirty and then you use those

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,600
things for future products and when you

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,100
say you know you mean like and you know

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,539
right here you're growing it in Arizona

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,399
you're growing it everywhere no that's

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,399
more like geoclimatized variety

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,980
basically genotype would be like the

21
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,960
structure or the way the leaf sets are

22
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,359
things that aren't going to change so

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,679
with phenotypical expression

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,899
phenotypical expression can be uh

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,719
affected by nutrition and environment

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,058
okay so I can take the same cut as you

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,140
right yeah and we could grow it at my

28
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:05,938
house and we could grow it at your house

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,599
it's going to express two different ways

30
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:08,279
you're going to get different

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,559
phenotypical expressions for sure

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,560
whereas the genotype could be exactly

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,200
the same so the the basically the way it

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,359
was like a freak Show uh Freakshow

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,478
that's the specific genotype of that

36
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,400
plant yeah

37
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,780
it's easy to spot that genome yeah but

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,580
it could smell different and that would

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,159
be the phenotype for sure for sure

40
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,219
that's that I was kind of behind it you

41
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,219
know
