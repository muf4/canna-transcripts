welcome to reader Syndicate 3.0 the next

2
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,718
evolution of the look into

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,080
counterculture that is Canon my name is

Matthew owner of Riot seeds and this

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,400
started as a one-man mission for strain

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,240
history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,640
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,038
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,679
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,960
Illuminati and other friends throughout

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,118
the seasons to hear their takes on grow

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,400
techniques breeding science strain

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,278

[Music]

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,000
Syndicate so yeah I was TR I was

20
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,640
thinking of like where to go with this

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,359
because you've done other shows before

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,239
but I think like briefly not even

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,799
briefly like as as much as you want to

24
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,839
go into on your start obviously where

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:00,399
your interest started how you got

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,640
specifically into like a very Niche area

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,478
of like the land race heirloom older

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,159
lines you know um yeah yeah and we have

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,319
questions from people in our Discord and

30
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,680
I want to talk some of the lines

31
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,199
obviously that you carry so it can shine

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,640
some light on some of those too plus I'm

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,320
interested in a lot of them and I have a

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,400
bunch so yeah yeah yeah nice um yeah uh

35
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,719
that's cool that people have sent in

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
questions because it's always good to

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,759
sort of yeah answer that for people

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,438
because often often I sort of don't

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,319
realize the extent I mean I do I do

40
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:32,519
people mention it but you know when

41
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,398
people come to the site and they're a

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,959
bit overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of

43
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:42,560
stuff on there and things like that yeah

44
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:44,519
um but yeah I mean um for me it was uh

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,960
something

46
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,599
the getting into this sort of niche as

47
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:55,639
it were was more um

48
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:58,839
the growing up in the UK in the

49
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,239
90s yeah

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:07,239
um some of my well in fact all of my

51
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:10,359
first encounters with cannabis were

52
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,640
through uh stuff that friends of mine's

53
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,480
parents had you know so sort of boomer

54
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:19,199
generation people who would still in

55
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,639
that era go and you know to napol and

56
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,359
places and bring back stuff to smoke and

57
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,000
that kind of thing and then the people

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,040
who I was talking to it about talking to

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,439
about it were also of that generation

60
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,519
and would sort of regil me with

61
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,239
anecdotes about smuggling hashack from

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,519
Afghanistan and this type of thing you

63
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,200
know so kind of triggered your interest

64
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,080
um yeah I mean that was my perspective

65
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:46,759
on it was that that was the real cache

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,480
the real kind of um you know um

67
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,799
mythologized stuff was that old old type

68
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,639
of old school cannabis you know that was

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,400
anyway what I was kind of raised the

70
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,279
context in which I grew up into cannabis

71
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,719
was one in which that was always had the

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,680
biggest sort sort of prestige attached

73
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,878
to it you know these were these old kind

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,719
of like um hippie type characters you

75
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,679
know like um is probably a

76
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,560
slightly I mean they definitely were

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,159
back in the 60s

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,360
but um those you know they were doing

79
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,519
the hippie trail and stuff and yeah

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,599
doing kind of scams like that and then

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,039
as teenagers we would occasionally like

82
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,798
you know I'm talking kind

83
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:32,560
of very early 90s and things would

84
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,760
obviously being so close to Amsterdam in

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,438
England anyway you um do we were seeing

86
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:44,239
that um people were starting to to grow

87
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,840
but it wasn't the indoor indoor kind of

88
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,438
domestic production in the UK didn't

89
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,158
really take off in a big way until the

90
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:54,639
late 90s early 2000s and suddenly in the

91
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,840
space of a couple of years imported

92
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,399
cannabis just disappeared from the UK

93
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,640
completely so most Imports anyway if

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,158
you're in UK unless you knew someone

95
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,279
were pretty [ __ ] [ __ ] Moroccan hash

96
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,598
to be honest throughout that era but if

97
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,438
you did know someone you could get you

98
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:13,359
know nice swy red sort of West

99
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,279
African

100
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,120
Nigerian and you could still get good

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,599
good Moroccan and you'd see Lebanese

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,280
you'd see very seldom see like really

103
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,720
good Afghan to get that you'd need to go

104
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,918
to Holland or someone somewhere to

105
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,520
actually find someone who could get the

106
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,439
real stuff because most of what most of

107
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,399
the Afghan Pakistani type hash by that

108
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,680
point that you'd see in the UK was bunk

109
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,319
even though people didn't seem to

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,280
realize you know yeah but um but uh

111
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,918
anyway

112
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,319
so but if we did if we did see like what

113
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,799
we would call skunk and that kind of

114
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,519
stuff in the early

115
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,639
90s we'd sit you know I'd sit with my

116
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,000
friends around their house and stuff and

117
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,639
their parents would just be like oh this

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,918
stuff's terrible why are you [ __ ]

119
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,680
touching all crap you know and they just

120
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,519
give us this kind of lecture about how

121
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,959
awful it is and stuff and um so that was

122
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:09,198
kind of my perception anyway and then

123
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,000
also you know friends of mine who are

124
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,240
Australians would basically had the same

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,839
attitude it's like if they came around

126
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,000
and they saw and this again older

127
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,279
generation you know if they saw us

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,319
growing things it'd be like oh these

129
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,799
aren't pure sativas you need like proper

130
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,319
sativas and they'd Rave about Thai and

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,120
Indonesian and paping yugin and sativas

132
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,080
and stuff you know so always my

133
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,478
perspective anywhere that so for it was

134
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,399
just that was the natural thing to be

135
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:36,240
interested in and when I did start

136
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,959
trying to grow for myself I sort of had

137
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,240
this realization [ __ ] hell I know

138
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,918
where all these places are I want these

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,120
seeds and I can see online that all

140
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,799
these other people are wanting these

141
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,160
seeds I know where to go to go and get

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,720
them and um so it's just a kind of

143
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,479
natural progression really it just um

144
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,080
you

145
00:05:52,478 --> 00:06:00,680
know uh it all kind of fell into

146
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:03,038
place that that takes connection like to

147
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,439
to track down like legitimate stuff and

148
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,759
and you seem to be quite a well read

149
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,279
historian of cannabis and um yeah I

150
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,038
can't imagine the links that you've had

151
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:16,799
to go to to to even to bring out a lot

152
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,680
of this old stuff and a lot of the the

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,639
land race stuff as

154
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,598
well um I would say it's sort of partly

155
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,800
become possible because of spending

156
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:32,159
enough time in these places that

157
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,360
um you get to know people and they trust

158
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,000
you enough you know yeah abely

159
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,639
of

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,439
uh it really varies though because some

161
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,960
some bits of some bits of the

162
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,680
um of Asia

163
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,079
anyway it's not really that you need

164
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,800
particularly to have connections you

165
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,560
just need to know where the places are

166
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,240
you know yeah so

167
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,959
um you know you can

168
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,639
you can go to this as long as you know

169
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,560
where the places are in a lot of in a

170
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,360
lot of the more Central Asian Parts it's

171
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,439
actually quite a lot easier because it's

172
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,240
it's really the tropics where it's more

173
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,279
tricky because there's no reason to have

174
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,639
seeds in the tropics other than to grow

175
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,799
C you know it's not like their food or

176
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,519
something like in napole some of the

177
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,478
landr types

178
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,639
anyway as much as anything are

179
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,399
cultivated for the seeds you know yeah

180
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,360
so there are some areas where and and

181
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,959
the same actually is kind of true in in

182
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,840
even in um the Hindu Kush you know is

183
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,038
the seeds are a winter food source as

184
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,239
well so you

185
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,279
could yeah yeah yeah people this is a

186
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,319
really overlooked thing actually like

187
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,519
even amongst the experts people seem to

188
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,560
realize

189
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:54,158
that cannabis is a multi-purpose crop in

190
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,918
all of the Northern areas like including

191
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,719
Afghanistan and the Hindu Kush the only

192
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,359
bit where it's not a multi-purpose crop

193
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,680
is in the tropical areas where where

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,360
it's ganja which is s the semi sensy

195
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,560
whatever you want to call it that's the

196
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,038
only where it's a single purpose crop it

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,199
is only grown for producing the buds you

198
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,000
know guess that makes sense too with the

199
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,000
hash with the hash production and stuff

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,038
because they could still collect the

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,158
hash and harvest the seeds yeah yeah so

202
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:23,519
you know um sometimes like um I've read

203
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:26,800
people like David Watson Sam skunkman

204
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:30,079
saying you know we tried really hard to

205
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,360
um persuade the Afghans to like grow the

206
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,478
crop as s am and like they just actually

207
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,440
just wer interested and there's a pretty

208
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,879
good reason for that which is that

209
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,800
actually the seeds are a very important

210
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,000
winter food source they're very high in

211
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,519
you know important fats and proteins as

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,480
well and particularly in the mountains

213
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
that's really necessary because

214
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,879
obviously you can't keep like huge herds

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
of animals very easily in in the

216
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,879
mountains you can have a few cows and

217
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,278
goats and stuff but it's not like um

218
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,078
there's a

219
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,439
there's a there's a huge demand for land

220
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:07,799
and water and everything in in any

221
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,560
mountain area and so you know if you

222
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,159
can have that extra source of protein

223
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,879
and fats it's it's pretty essential

224
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,240
actually you know I

225
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,519
would some of the Mid Eastern places

226
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,159
would be super hard to uh make those

227
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,799
connection especially nowadays um I

228
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,120
remember hearing even Neville's story

229
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,958
back with

230
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,159
um I think Clive I think that's what he

231
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,679
goes by

232
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:37,078
um when they went to I think it was

233
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,120
Afghanistan and one of them ODed in a

234
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,078
hut and they were you know trying to

235
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,759
kick in their door and whatnot that

236
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:44,799
that's how the story went anyways so I

237
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,559
can only imagine how crazy it is to try

238
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,519
to get inroads in their nowadays with

239
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,559
the political

240
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,360
climate um I mean one thing one thing

241
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:56,359
I'd pick up on first is just in terms of

242
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,039
thinking about the geography of cannabis

243
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,480
um Afghanistan I think if you if you

244
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,319
want to have a kind of

245
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,560
clear just because I think it's really

246
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,600
helpful you know with with everything is

247
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:11,039
like context is everything and and for

248
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,240
cannabis it's really good to get the

249
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,199
geographical and cultural context kind

250
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,320
of on a basic kind of map in your mind

251
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,399
as it were and I would say Afghanistan

252
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,680
is best sort of it's like Southern

253
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,278
Central Asia so Central Asia rather than

254
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:29,120
the Middle East is how I would talk

255
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:31,639
about it in terms because it's um that's

256
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,440
the really Central you know in what we

257
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:36,399
call indicas in the sort of loose sense

258
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,079
colloquial sense are a Central Asian

259
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,360
domesticate basically and uh so

260
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:43,838
Afghanistan is really sort of the

261
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,159
Southern edge of Central Asia and um

262
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,560
rather than the Middle East I think if

263
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:53,319
you is Middle East isly more sort of

264
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:55,719
confusing confusing term yeah yeah um

265
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,040
because you know it connects Afghanistan

266
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,200
really sort of connects in a cannabis

267
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,039
sense with shinjang and places like that

268
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,600
which is eastern central Asia yeah

269
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,599
bukara is sort of really you know

270
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
Central Central Asia as it were and

271
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,639
those are all

272
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:14,519
historically very connected

273
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:18,039
important cannabis centers in terms of

274
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:21,799
the sort of indicia type yeah land races

275
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:24,439
um but yeah going to those places

276
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,519
um yeah I mean it's been it's been

277
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,480
increasingly difficult

278
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:33,039
um especially with the uh

279
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,600
Taliban being allowed to kind of yeah

280
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:39,559
retake the entire place and stuff but um

281
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,079
yeah and you know there is also yeah the

282
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:44,199
fact the

283
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:46,439
other definitely one thing I found going

284
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,079
to those bits of the world is that the

285
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,000
the culture of kind of OPM and stuff

286
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,679
does um mix with the Cannabis culture

287
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,399
quite a lot and I definitely met

288
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,958
characters who were having problems with

289
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,600
things like you know harder

290
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:05,879
substances like heroin yeah but

291
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,200
um

292
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,600
the yeah I mean it's there's there's

293
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,800
various ways to do these things I mean

294
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,199
some of the people who were helping us

295
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:18,958
for a while were were were stringers for

296
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:21,240
for media um and journalism in fact all

297
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:25,039
of the people I know

298
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,919
who from these places who were were were

299
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,879
were working as stringers and uh which

300
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:32,599
means sort of helping um

301
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,120
um you know journalists and media

302
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,079
companies who who want to make

303
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,078
Productions in those areas to to meet

304
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,479
the people find the right places doing

305
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,799
that kind of job and then they would um

306
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,720
just have a sideline in like helping

307
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,519
collect seeds for us basically you know

308
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,000
and then obviously once

309
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:55,440
the once the

310
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,759
um the the um Biden sort of pulled the

311
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,760
plug on air support for and tech support

312
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,159
and everything for the Afghan Army and

313
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:09,559
it just got overrun and most of them had

314
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:11,919
to then um spend the next sort of you

315
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:15,159
know half a year in like safe houses

316
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,159
trying not to get

317
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,600
executed yeah it's not great it gives

318
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:19,838
you a different perspective on these

319
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,399
things because everyone's sort of like I

320
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,360
mean you

321
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,600
know detour too far into politics but I

322
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,720
I thought the whole that whole

323
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,360
um post 11 Adventure was just completely

324
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,560
misguided but it's like once they've

325
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,079
actually committed to it to then just

326
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,319
suddenly [ __ ] turn around and say

327
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:39,679
actually you know what [ __ ] that we're

328
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,839
just going to leave and not even tell

329
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:46,120
you yeah was just a just an astonishing

330
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,800
[ __ ] betrayal but everyone was

331
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,679
expecting it so it's American that's

332
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:54,278
what they do

333
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,519
it's is between extremes there's no sort

334
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,159
of just seems to be capable of finding a

335
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,879
kind of sensible middle ground on

336
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,958
foreign policy to

337
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,439
yeah always going one way or the other

338
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,399
too far it's like oh we don't want

339
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,759
nothing to do with it oh we're all in oh

340
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,720
we want nothing to do with it oh we're

341
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:13,000
all in it's like Jesus man just [ __ ]

342
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,720
you know this insane ISM that seems to

343
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,639
[ __ ] infect all the thinking about it

344
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,600
leaving all the caches of weapons and

345
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,879
whatnot too just to find their their

346
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,320
homes to

347
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:27,559
wherever do something Ukraine the way

348
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:32,639
it's going so just gift them the entire

349
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:35,078
[ __ ] um anyway but yeah um it's it's

350
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,039
it's um but yeah so yeah I mean that's

351
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:40,799
that's mostly what I've seen of it is

352
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:43,719
the the post 911 kind of version of the

353
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,198
hippie Trail so it is quite hard to

354
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,199
avoid the political aspects of it

355
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,319
because it absolutely the landscape so

356
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,439
transformed by the time I got to see

357
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,920
most of it like it you know the context

358
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
in which I saw people smoking a lot were

359
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,759
like um security guards and sort of yeah

360
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,079
you know sort of those kind of

361
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,919
characters like sitting around like with

362
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,159
like you

363
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:12,838
know guns and stuff outside places like

364
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,240
embassies and hotels and whatever you

365
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,360
know very publicly smoking hash and

366
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,000
things it's like there sort of there's a

367
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,959
whole um Marshal kind of militant not

368
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,159
militant you know

369
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:28,838
um Warfare type context of cannabis use

370
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,958
there and things that I started to as

371
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:35,000
young it's not just a sort of um the the

372
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,439
hippie Trail stereotypes of sort of

373
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,799
spiritual use and things are actually

374
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,160
just one side of the the culture of

375
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,719
cannabis there's whole ranges of of ways

376
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:46,519
it's used traditionally that aren't

377
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,399
necessarily part of the main Western

378
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,039
discourse of like Oriental cannabis

379
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
culture you know yeah that's that's part

380
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,480
of the story that fascinates me because

381
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,319
it's it's a lot of the stuff that even

382
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,680
as deep into cannabis history and stuff

383
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,519
as I am that's like not something I'm

384
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,359
really super familiar with so I don't

385
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,839
speak on it you know I don't know it but

386
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,680
you're the type of person that I can

387
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,759
speak to that has a lot more insight

388
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,439
into that and I think uh the more people

389
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,560
are able to see all these different

390
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,000
perspectives um different ways of

391
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,919
thinking about how it's been used maybe

392
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,679
ways they've never even considered you

393
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,879
know I think that's really important to

394
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:23,000
talk

395
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,799
about yeah I think it's like I think

396
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,519
everyone you know we all kind of want

397
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,120
to uh kind of know what the roots of the

398
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,360
plant are and where it's come from and

399
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,039
things um but there's definitely been a

400
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,360
tendency in in sort of the WR on in in a

401
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:41,039
lot of the writing about it to to favor

402
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,159
this idea that it's

403
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,919
um to to favor aspects of it that fitted

404
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:50,159
with the sort of historical moment of

405
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,719
the 60s when it really became a mass

406
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,278
phenomenon in the west you know which

407
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,560
was yeah most sort of the anti-war

408
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,799
anti-racist um an sort of

409
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,039
countercultural

410
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,838
uh aspects that were emphasized although

411
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,480
things like you know the assassins and

412
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,000
stuff did kind of creep in there because

413
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,400
that was already talked about quite a

414
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,199
lot in sort of

415
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,679
Orient myths of or Legends or whatever

416
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,959
so you know that and that

417
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,280
does go into the martial context of use

418
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,400
and stuff as

419
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,279
well one one thing I thought we should

420
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,519
go over early on too because uh I mean

421
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,798
the nomenclature is important and and

422
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:33,720
even even this far in like I don't feel

423
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,918
confident anymore like trying to say

424
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,038
what I think a land race is versus an

425
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,880
heirloom versus you know anything else

426
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,558
um I'd love to have your your actual

427
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,240
working definitions of some of these

428
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:46,119
things as we talk about it so people

429
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,599
understand what we're talking about when

430
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,759
we say land race and heirloom varieties

431
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,678
yeah yeah sure always a good idea yeah

432
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:57,640
it's just [ __ ] mindfield of like

433
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,559
different terms so so I mean land race

434
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,159
is just a really unfort forunate word

435
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:04,639
from my perspective that was a

436
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:08,720
translation that was made in the sort of

437
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,600
late 19th early late 19th century from

438
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,440
various European languages into English

439
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:17,240
from German terms Danish terms whatever

440
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,600
like l in German it would be land rasa

441
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,200
that was translated into English as land

442
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,199
race um whereas actually if you were to

443
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,000
do that translation these days land race

444
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,480
would be best translated as country

445
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,119
breed or something like that

446
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,558
oh yeah so it's a

447
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,558
defunct form of the word race that we

448
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:43,918
just don't use anymore it's completely

449
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,960
archaic now in English but it was race

450
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,080
did once in English have the meaning of

451
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,840
breed as in a created something that

452
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:55,558
someone has breed has created like a

453
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:59,678
crop or a breed of animal you know so so

454
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:01,798
so land races a uh

455
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,880
artificially selected they're Creations

456
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,918
by humans for products that we want

457
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,520
they're created in certain areas by

458
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,200
Farmers so they they have an element of

459
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,558
region being region specific and culture

460
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,960
but they're culture specific and they're

461
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,158
absolutely creatures of human desire and

462
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,519
whatever so they they're things that

463
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,720
farmers have created for certain

464
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:28,119
products so all land races are product

465
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,960
specific so the um tropical land races

466
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:32,759
are spefic specific

467
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,319
for and we're talking drug quote you

468
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,640
know air quotes drug cannabis here so

469
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:40,558
tropical land races from places like

470
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,120
India southeast Asia are all

471
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,759
specifically

472
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:49,359
for uh c/ semi Sensi as in ganja is the

473
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,000
traditional term for this like it's the

474
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:55,038
seedless inflorescences or or you know

475
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
very lightly seeded yeah should be like

476
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:01,679
that and then that product goes back to

477
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,519
at least the 15th century perhaps as

478
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,960
early as the 12th century in India you

479
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,960
can find Sanskrit literature that

480
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,840
describes that technique of roguing out

481
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,558
the males cutting down the males how to

482
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,038
maximize resin production by certain

483
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,759
cultivation techniques and so on so

484
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:19,200
Jesus what we call sativas

485
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,319
are you know there those are what we

486
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,480
call sativas so the tropical land races

487
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:26,839
narrowly

488
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:30,880
flitted um high THC because they've got

489
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:32,558
this uh long his history of individual

490
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,919
plant selection

491
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:40,279
that's enabled by keeping the seed

492
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,280
from batch of good ganja you know

493
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,079
because yeah in

494
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:49,639
practice uh Farmers

495
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:50,879
don't you know you can find uh genuinely

496
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,240
100%

497
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,960
C it is still around even these days in

498
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,279
in places like India and la and Thailand

499
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,600
and stuff but for the most part

500
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:05,440
you if you buy a batch

501
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:07,759
of any significant size of ganja you

502
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,080
will find one or two seeds in there if

503
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:15,158
you're in India you know it's can be

504
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:17,319
loads of seeds often you know but

505
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,640
um it shouldn't be like that and

506
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:22,599
historically it wasn't like that for the

507
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,120
most part you know it's amazing goes

508
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:27,199
back that far I didn't know that that it

509
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:30,278
went back to the with h

510
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,558
selections yeah yeah so with with um

511
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:36,240
cutting down um yeah and you know so the

512
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,960
the point the point is that individual

513
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,880
plant selection is a is a strong

514
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,000
selected pressure and that is enabled by

515
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,559
that strong seleced pressure is enabled

516
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,880
by the fact that you do often

517
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,599
find a seed or two in a batch of ganja

518
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
that you would buy you know absolutely

519
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:57,519
so consumers and afficionados and

520
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,559
farmers are all able to do that so

521
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,918
consciously or unconscious ly you've got

522
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:04,599
at least 500 years of individual plant

523
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,520
selection being a factor in the creation

524
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,599
of sativas which is why as any kind of

525
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,679
offici andado knows they are the

526
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,678
strongest forms of land races

527
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,559
Thai Lao

528
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,278
Burmese South Indian like

529
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,440
Kerala uh all these types of plants are

530
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:27,720
what went in to form the real kind of

531
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,919
original Haze yeah type sativas that

532
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,919
people know in the States and you know

533
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,520
back in the late 60s early' 70s this was

534
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,240
literally

535
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:42,720
fetching multiples its weight in gold in

536
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,599
terms of price by the time it got from

537
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,278
from Thailand to the west coast of the

538
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,678
United States and it was the same in in

539
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:54,640
England so if you look at the custom

540
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,080
seizures records from the early 70s for

541
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,159
for for cannabis that was coming from

542
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:01,399
places like Ean and Thailand it was like

543
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,000
they were it was testing you know with

544
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,720
thin layer chromatography but which is

545
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,759
not hugely accurate but it was testing

546
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,798
kind of 17% THC yeah and that's when

547
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:13,839
they're not gaming the tests and it's

548
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:15,679
probably sat in a warehouse in London or

549
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,879
for months never mind how long it took

550
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,480
to get to England in the first place you

551
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,120
know yeah so yeah I me we're talking

552
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,240
high levels of potency so people aren't

553
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,119
making it up when they say that this

554
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,038
stuff could blow your head off you know

555
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,479
even in the 7s and to doesn't you don't

556
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:35,359
need much more than 10% THC anyway a lot

557
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,960
of it's about the other stuff that's in

558
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,399
this in these the other phyto chemicals

559
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,360
that are in these PLS absolutely anyway

560
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,080
to to stay focused so there those are

561
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,319
the sativas and then in the north the

562
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:52,759
main group is what people call

563
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:55,519
colloquially indicas which are the you

564
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:58,038
know I guess everyone knows what I'm

565
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:01,158
talking about broadly speaking but again

566
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:04,278
this is a type of land race that um you

567
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:07,200
know with the more semi- dwarf

568
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:09,079
morphology used for making hash so

569
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,278
product specific there's no culture of

570
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:16,839
CA in north of 30 degrees latitude so

571
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:19,200
once you've got to the north of Pakistan

572
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,959
there just is no fact in fact once

573
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,600
you've even got to the Punjab in India

574
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:29,038
or the Punjab in Pakistan it's bisected

575
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:30,879
by colonialism the um once you've got

576
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,319
there there's no culture of s by the

577
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,960
time you even get to the Punjab once

578
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,798
you've gone north of the Punjab towards

579
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,919
the foothills of the Hindu

580
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:42,158
Kush absolutely no sense culture at all

581
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,880
it's all hash and uh it's always been

582
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,640
that way so when you make hash you pull

583
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,480
the seeds yeah in the process of making

584
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,559
the hash so there just there not ever re

585
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,599
been much in the way of any individual

586
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:59,200
plant selection on hash land races so

587
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:03,319
they bulk selected crop

588
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,960
that probably goes back Millennia

589
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:12,398
perhaps um that bulk selection which is

590
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:17,319
why on balance the the um the the

591
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:19,519
cannabinoid um uh characteristics of of

592
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:21,759
of of Inda land races do of lean

593
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,480
slightly towards THC

594
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,759
dominant um plants like type one plants

595
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,960
as people would call it but you do have

596
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:32,158
in the population a mix of

597
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,240
type one type two type three uh so you

598
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,440
know High ratio of THC to CBD is type

599
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,000
one balanced THC and CBD is type two and

600
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,480
then type three is sort of higher ratio

601
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,640
of CBD to THC so most hash land races

602
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,200
will typically if they're a pure land

603
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,759
race we're talking not a you know not

604
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,000
Afghani number one or something you can

605
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,519
buy off a

606
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,079
Dutch um seed bank um if they're a real

607
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,240
land race they tend to be like that they

608
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,639
do lean slightly W type one because

609
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,919
they've had that history of bulk

610
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,759
selection it's you know more than random

611
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:11,600
more than random lean towards type one

612
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:14,038
but um uh yeah if if you want to grow a

613
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,278
crop of cila from from seed it's not

614
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:20,919
much

615
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:23,079
use uh to to to use a a real land race

616
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,880
you know there need to be worked to to

617
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,240
make them a cin cultiva you know so if

618
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,120
you were talking about the difference

619
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,200
between an heirloom and a land race

620
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,199
heirloom is not a technical term as far

621
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,159
as I know but it I would Define it in

622
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,480
the context of cannabis as uh a land

623
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,720
race that's been worked specifically for

624
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:47,000
in in a in a western modern context for

625
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:50,200
cin so x18 or deep chunk or Afghani

626
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,679
number one they're all in indicia

627
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,399
indicia heirlooms in the sense they're

628
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,559
an indicia land race that's been worked

629
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:59,359
for making sense yeah that's how Define

630
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:02,278
it that makes sense yeah yeah

631
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,079
yeah uh and then you've got one other

632
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:07,119
feral varieties then like how how would

633
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,918
you define those in in terms of like

634
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,639
land race heirloom is it its own

635
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,240
type

636
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,919
um so

637
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,720
um

638
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,720
feral or kind of wild type is another

639
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,519
term you could use that I think is quite

640
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,960
good um there

641
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,480
um you you don't find them much in the

642
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,038
tropics that as as a as a rule cannabis

643
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,360
doesn't

644
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:39,480
naturalize uh very well in the tropics

645
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:43,278
it's not uh a species that is well

646
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:46,960
adapted to that type of climate so if

647
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,519
you do find if you do find feral um

648
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,919
cannabis in the tropics it's because

649
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,519
you're you're you're at altitude

650
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,080
somewhere with a fairly temperate

651
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,720
climate

652
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,839
um so for the most part if you if you're

653
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,200
in for example India

654
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,599
you might find

655
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,319
weedy uh cannabis growing like anywhere

656
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,158
sort of north of the Ganges so we're

657
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,918
talking between in in in the sort of top

658
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,000
half of North India between the Ganges

659
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,640
and the Himalayas you know okay and then

660
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,558
as you go up towards the Himalayas

661
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,880
suddenly you'll find areas where it just

662
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,678
grows [ __ ] everywhere you

663
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,440
know just Seas of feral stuff especially

664
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,640
if you go up into Pakistan like Punjab

665
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,080
[ __ ]

666
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:30,240
everywhere um uh and then up into the

667
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:31,639
mountains around the river and places it

668
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,240
anywhere where there's kind of disturbed

669
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,600
land but it's basically uh as a species

670
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,599
it's

671
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:42,038
uh it's a step species meaning it likes

672
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:45,398
kind of

673
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:48,919
windy um fairly dry places where there's

674
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:50,798
lots of disturbed land and uh to grow

675
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,000
along the sides of rivers where animals

676
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,440
come to drink and [ __ ] and

677
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,319
stuff like high

678
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,320
nitrogen uh

679
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,519
decent amounts of water but not rainy

680
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:07,200
you know

681
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:12,278
um CBD dominant for stuff like

682
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:15,360
that um no um not necessarily so um

683
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:17,119
basically they're kind of um like nobody

684
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,319
knows where there's a pure nobody's ever

685
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:22,518
kind of satisfactorily identified like a

686
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:24,158
pure wild like unaffected by humans pure

687
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,399
wild cannabis plants has never been

688
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,278
found you know that makes sense so what

689
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,959
you actually have is like parallel

690
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:31,798
populations that have just been swapping

691
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,440
genes with whatever the local form of

692
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:36,839
cannabis is you know in the sense of

693
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,080
like humans domesticated at

694
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:43,199
least I don't know kind of say 8,000

695
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,918
years ago probably we started at least

696
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,798
you know unintentionally domesticating

697
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,278
cannabis yeah and um by just bringing it

698
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:54,639
back to Hunter gather is like bringing

699
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:57,159
it back to places where they were eating

700
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,799
and stuff like were unconsciously

701
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,840
selecting for types that we liked you

702
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,558
know yeah and then quite happy to grow

703
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:07,278
around our campfires and stuff because

704
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,798
there was lots of [ __ ] and discarded

705
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:14,440
animal bones and stuff that just are

706
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:18,359
good for cannabis to so

707
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:21,480
um um basically if you're in somewhere

708
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:23,879
like the Punjab where it grows which is

709
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,000
north uh West

710
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,919
India where where where there's a lot of

711
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,480
wildr cannabis you can you can people do

712
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,120
like crop the

713
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,000
feral uh weedy stuff provided it's

714
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,479
somewhere clean that's not Dusty and

715
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,599
things you can just crop that and um use

716
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,599
it for making food and things you know

717
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:48,558
yeah so these are high high THC

718
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,959
um in in the sense of

719
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,398
uh they will get you stoned you know

720
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,038
it's yeah it's it's not like in um

721
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:57,079
places like I don't know Wisconsin or

722
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,398
somewhere in the states where it's

723
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:01,480
basically hemp that's gone feral you

724
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:04,879
know yeah the fiber h

725
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,919
r yeah I mean these are definitely like

726
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,440
if we're talking probably make things

727
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:11,399
confusing but anyway these are like in

728
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,120
in in in in those in all of sort of

729
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:16,558
Central and South South Asia where you

730
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:20,798
get feral populations it's pretty much

731
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:23,398
um drug drug type quotes cannabis yeah

732
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,960
and then in the Himalayas like uh people

733
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:29,959
do sometimes hand rub the the feral

734
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,079
populations for for Charis and it makes

735
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,200
what people sometimes call jungly chis

736
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,638
as in like wild chis but actually

737
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,038
there's a again this is one of those

738
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:41,398
kind of hippie Trail type

739
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:44,038
confusions there's been this assumption

740
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:46,278
that Himalayan cannabis is always feral

741
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,919
cannabis which is it which it isn't like

742
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:50,960
yeah

743
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,840
99% of the Charis that's produced in the

744
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,759
Himalayas every year is

745
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:59,158
From

746
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,599
domesticated intentionally cultivated at

747
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,639
land races grown in fields by a farmer

748
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:08,119
you know yeah this that it's the

749
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:10,638
Himalayan cannabis is uh is all wild and

750
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:12,278
stuff is not not accurate like in terms

751
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:15,000
of the product is is very seldom

752
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:17,440
produced from the wild wedi stands you

753
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,759
can and people do but it's got way less

754
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,519
resin production than the than the

755
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,319
actual land races do you know

756
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,359
I'm yeah and and and it's useless for

757
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:31,158
making Cino it's not it's all going to

758
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:34,638
be seeded anyway yeah you can't use it

759
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:36,399
for to smoke as butd it's just it's I

760
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:38,719
mean you do see sadu doing that I have

761
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,678
seen sadu like her Yogi's wondering kind

762
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,278
of Yogi characters whove yeah gone up to

763
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:47,399
the Himalayas and picked picked a whole

764
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:49,359
load of feral flowers and then they just

765
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,000
sit and they kind of pick out the seeds

766
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,079
and mix it with some tobacco and smoke

767
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,319
it but it's it's not like it's uh you

768
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:59,319
know it's

769
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:01,398
not um designed for that yeah is why

770
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,759
people graub it for Chas because it it's

771
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,959
timec consuming to do but you end up

772
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,599
with a product that is actually going to

773
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,200
get you stoned yeah whereas smoking a

774
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,959
whole load of feral Bud like that mixed

775
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,480
with tobacco it's more just like a kind

776
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,440
of maybe take the edge

777
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,720
off whatever physical discomfort you

778
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,558
experience as a as a wondering Yogi but

779
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,639
it's not going to like get you

780
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:22,759
particularly High I wouldn't have

781
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:28,000
thought unless you really just happen to

782
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:30,720
find an unusually strong plant sure yeah

783
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,240
you know um one of the the interesting

784
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,399
things like from from the American

785
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,278
perspective at least for mine um is

786
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:42,038
trying like in my mind to Divi Define

787
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:44,880
Expressions between uh when people talk

788
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:48,119
about indicia types specifically or the

789
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,960
the broadleaf types um the differences

790
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:56,678
between like an Afghan type plant and a

791
00:33:51,960 --> 00:34:00,480
Pakistani plant where the the overlap is

792
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:04,798
and you know like there's always talk of

793
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,240
Chinese um broadleaf types and I I've

794
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,800
never got my hands on any of those I

795
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,320
remember someone made the unan available

796
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,119
for a while but I never got to grow any

797
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,039
um I'd like to hear some of your Insight

798
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,280
on that and the the major differences

799
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:20,759
and I know it's kind of hard to

800
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,679
generally speak on expressions from

801
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,399
Whole regions you know depending on the

802
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,720
elevation but is there anything that

803
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,398
you've noticed between um say

804
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:32,678
Afghanistan and Pak Pakistan in in how

805
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:34,039
they grow um scent Expressions anything

806
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,200
like

807
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:40,000
that I mean it's it's particularly

808
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,638
difficult with um those Northern type

809
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,760
Central Asian you know Afghan Pakistani

810
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,200
yeah

811
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,159
uh populations because what you get if

812
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,480
you grow like a first generation of

813
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,200
direct from those places like seeds

814
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,838
directly from a farmer in Pakistan or

815
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,719
Afghanistan whatever there's a huge

816
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,199
amount of variation within the

817
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:05,000
population of one batch of seeds from

818
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:07,519
one farmer so the range of Aromas that

819
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,800
you're going to find in one field from

820
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,880
plant to plant just in one of those land

821
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,920
races is extraordinarily diverse you

822
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,800
know one plant might be really kind of

823
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,800
like kind of candy shot sweet Tangy

824
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,960
Aromas the next one might smell like a

825
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:27,839
dog [ __ ] you know yeah whatever and and

826
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,039
and and so it's particularly in those

827
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,719
Northern populations there's because

828
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:35,400
they're bulk selected they're not as

829
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:38,000
genetically narrow as tropical sativa

830
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,320
populations are so because they they

831
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,400
haven't had they haven't you know the

832
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,119
the genome hasn't been Stepped On by

833
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,119
Farmers doing much in the way of very

834
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,519
consciously intentionally directed

835
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,240
breeding there's a huge amount of

836
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:56,159
variation anyway and

837
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:59,559
then on top of that in terms of the

838
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:02,440
difficulty of generalizing you know cuz

839
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:07,559
the the Assumption amongst afficionados

840
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:10,880
is that Precision more Precision in in

841
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:12,960
your description means more accuracy but

842
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,960
actually if you get if you get too

843
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,838
precise on these things you become less

844
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,519
accurate you know yeah for sure there's

845
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,000
vast amounts of diversity so

846
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,440
particularly with cannabis because it's

847
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,119
so

848
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,200
phenotypically plastic so it because

849
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:33,519
like I saying it's a mountain

850
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:37,719
uh species that's evolved um at

851
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:39,838
altitude um to adapt to the huge climate

852
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:42,799
shifts you get at altitude and that kind

853
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:45,039
of thing it can express itself very

854
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,920
differently depending on where it's

855
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,519
planted so if you were to plant the same

856
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,720
land race at sea level and then plant it

857
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,440
at three and a half th000

858
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:58,199
meters exactly the same batch of seeds

859
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,800
from the same fare

860
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,799
uh you will see very different plant

861
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,318
looking plants morphologically because

862
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,119
you plant them up higher altitude

863
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:09,079
they're going to grow much shorter broad

864
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,440
more broadly they're going to pump out

865
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,160
way more resin yeah probably going to

866
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,760
have different phytochemicals really

867
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,239
smell different and everything you know

868
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,520
so yeah and likewise if you you can get

869
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,519
that even with tropical sativas if you

870
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:24,559
grow them on well they're going to be

871
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:26,000
amazing if you grow them incompetently

872
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,078
they're not going to smell so good you

873
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,400
know yeah um

874
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,280
you kind of have to go to point of

875
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:36,800
origin to to experience them as they

876
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,280
are uh yeah I mean it definitely makes a

877
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,720
vast difference even with the more

878
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,040
genetically narrow populations like

879
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,239
tropical steas if they're grown well by

880
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,318
someone who knows how to do it on the

881
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:51,000
right type of land with the right

882
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:55,358
irrigation timing the right feeding

883
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,039
timing the right uh you know everything

884
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,199
if you overwater tropical late and

885
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,039
flower is going to keep growing keep

886
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:05,239
putting out Buds and leaflets and it's

887
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,920
going to be [ __ ] yeah and no one and

888
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:09,199
this is why you get all this Bullocks

889
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,519
talk about 30 weeks ativas indoors and

890
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:15,078
stuff it's just people just keep on

891
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:17,960
[ __ ] watering it you know so stoping

892
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:19,680
experience but anyway you know and if

893
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,199
you look at the Historical records it's

894
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,879
always it will tell you this like in the

895
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:29,039
um 19th century documentation of of the

896
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,240
ganja farms in um Bengal and places it's

897
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,000
like yeah Farmers always say the worst

898
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,838
thing that can happen is we get rains in

899
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,159
like January February and it'll [ __ ] up

900
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:39,199
our whole crop because it will start

901
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:42,719
shooting again yada yada yada yeah

902
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,639
anyway so it's all it's all there if if

903
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,799
you if you want to look and stuff and I

904
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,598
have blogged about this on on the site

905
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,119
as well if people are wanting to go into

906
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,480
more depth and you can find all the

907
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,838
sources and stuff but um it's amazing

908
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,039
blog by the way like it's I've learned a

909
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:01,119
lot reading through it over the years oh

910
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:05,119
that's good to know I I GL glad someone

911
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:08,280
reads it yeah I do I mean it's it's how

912
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,318
I how I um like came to know you without

913
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,000
speaking to you a bunch was through the

914
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:15,800
blog and seeing the passion and how you

915
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,880
write and how in-depth the detail was

916
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,760
and and over time learning how accurate

917
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,920
it was which is the most important you

918
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,200
know yeah yeah man thanks I appreciate

919
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,079
it I I've shifted most of it now to the

920
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,960
actual main website blog rather than the

921
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,640
sort of um independent blog because uh

922
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,119
it just seems to make more sense so

923
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,440
generally I've been kind of moving

924
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,119
everything over to the main blog on the

925
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,000
site now just because uh it seems to

926
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,280
make more sense but I before I lose the

927
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,760
thread of what you were originally

928
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,680
asking um so in terms of Pakistan versus

929
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,119
Afghanistan so the thing to bear in mind

930
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:53,118
is like um seeds move around a lot seeds

931
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,079
move around with people in areas where

932
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,000
people use them as as a food and not

933
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,160
just for growing as well

934
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,679
yeah plus

935
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:06,399
um uh you know these are artificial

936
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:10,279
political boundaries so there's no

937
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,559
cultural real boundary if in in in

938
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,839
meaningful terms cannabis wise

939
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,639
between the Hindu Kush in Pakistan and

940
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:18,880
the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan you know

941
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,400
yeah so I want to try to kind of avoid

942
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,599
being sort of [ __ ] as far as possible

943
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,838
but there's all this stuff I see on

944
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,838
Instagram with people talking about

945
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:30,039
Duren line and stuff and like the dur is

946
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,519
this it's just just [ __ ] that's

947
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:33,759
bizarre to me as well because I think

948
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,800
most of the kids who are doing this are

949
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,839
like Asian as well so it's like the DAR

950
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,680
line was just Dar was just some [ __ ]

951
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:43,759
from the UK who drew a pencil line

952
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,679
across the boundary between Pakistan and

953
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,400
Afghanistan you know the [ __ ] has that

954
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:51,919
got to do with anything you know

955
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:56,240
and and and it's only in the last kind

956
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,280
of 10 years the um uh they've actually

957
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,118
really started policing that border and

958
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,280
putting fences up and things and even

959
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,640
then it doesn't make the blindest

960
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,160
[ __ ] bit of difference anyone who

961
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,318
really wants to get things across it can

962
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:10,318
still do it but in cannabis terms it's

963
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:13,440
just [ __ ] meaningless I mean and and

964
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,440
and seeds have been you know uh seeds

965
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,039
have been moved from Afghanistan down to

966
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,800
places like tra Valley in Pakistan you

967
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,920
know there's there's plenty of local

968
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,680
stories about the various kind of

969
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,280
dervish like kander Sufi type Saint

970
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:29,318
characters who are s of credited with

971
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,319
bringing seeds into T and things and and

972
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:33,800
and um which T is one of the big

973
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:35,920
cultivation valleys in Pakistan and yeah

974
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,920
this this whole area is is seemless

975
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,400
seamless with it's the whole reason the

976
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,880
politics and the history is the way it

977
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,639
is is because it's impossible to police

978
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,400
these mountain borders you know oh I'm

979
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:49,199
sure huge smuggling between these places

980
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,400
and then uh chitral is another one of

981
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,799
the famous areas like yaku Valley and

982
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,599
things up in the Hindu Kush these all

983
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,960
lead into Shin Jang these are the trade

984
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,920
routes that you would take from shinjang

985
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,599
which is the Eastern Central Asian area

986
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:07,119
this turkic area of of politically it's

987
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:10,440
inside what's now China and this was a

988
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,280
the biggest hash producing uh region in

989
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,800
in the world for oh wow for centuries oh

990
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,280
absolutely I mean this was the epicenter

991
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,000
of hash production so it wasn't

992
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,800
Afghanistan or Pakistan it was shinjang

993
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,679
was until the

994
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,760
19 late 1930s was the absolute [ __ ]

995
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:28,719
epicenter of world hash production I

996
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,920
mean thousands and thousands of tons of

997
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:34,838
hash were being moved from these places

998
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,838
across the mountain passes into the into

999
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:39,400
India because all the money was in

1000
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:40,920
Northern India yeah and the demand for

1001
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,160
these products was in Northern India in

1002
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,358
these huge cities which even in the late

1003
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:48,078
19th century places like lore and Delhi

1004
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,920
had millions of well lore certainly had

1005
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,680
is the big kjab city had you know seven

1006
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,599
eight 9 10 million people or whatever

1007
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:57,759
even in the

1008
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,240
1860s so these were

1009
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,640
massively massive senses of demand for

1010
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,318
these products and so they the the

1011
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:08,598
production was all happening in eastern

1012
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:10,239
central Asia so in shinjang and um you

1013
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,318
know the British were trying to make

1014
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,759
sure as much of what came into India was

1015
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,800
being taxed effectively they didn't want

1016
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,359
too much smuggling and um you know seeds

1017
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,720
were moving around between these places

1018
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:25,759
you can read about the people who were

1019
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:28,078
responsible for uh a lot of the uh

1020
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,400
initiation of like commercial production

1021
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:35,559
in in um in shinjang for India were

1022
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,400
often Indians or uh ethnically E from

1023
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,079
ethnic groups of of the mountains of

1024
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,680
Pakistan you know

1025
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:47,440
so there there's just not

1026
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:48,879
um um much basis for assuming that

1027
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,119
there's going to be

1028
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,760
a you know there's there's a very

1029
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,559
nuanced picture if you're talking about

1030
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,559
the diff how how these land races in

1031
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,640
these regions are differentiated from

1032
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,880
each other

1033
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:01,318
yeah once you get into Pakistan in the

1034
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,400
northern mountains there probably is a

1035
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,279
certain degree of mixing between kind of

1036
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,200
the more sativa type

1037
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,800
um the further south you move away from

1038
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,358
the southern edges of Central Asia the

1039
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,280
further south you get away from the

1040
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,960
Hindu

1041
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,720
Kush there probably is

1042
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,400
more prep there is a a higher likelihood

1043
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:25,519
that you're going to have a degree of

1044
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:29,960
intermixing with more Monsoon type

1045
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:32,559
tropical type Punjabi type

1046
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,280
populations uh so you know more

1047
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,760
hybridization between sativa type

1048
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,240
populations and indicia type populations

1049
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,319
the further north you go

1050
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,479
into I don't know into places like

1051
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,639
shinjang there a higher likelihood I

1052
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,838
guess of it being a a sort of quotes

1053
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,679
pure indicia type you know so if you

1054
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,719
look at the plants that were brought

1055
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,960
back from Shin Jang in the early 20th

1056
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:59,358
century by people like Frank Meyer and

1057
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,800
stuff for the US DA they definitely are

1058
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:05,759
very Inda

1059
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,680
looking um plants and um uh yeah I mean

1060
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,480
you know um you had some of those

1061
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,719
pictures on your blog too correct yeah

1062
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,358
yeah so yeah and and

1063
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,358
um uh you know

1064
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:20,838
they're there's no question that there

1065
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:23,400
are these distinct types you know the

1066
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:25,759
confusion the confusion with the

1067
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,880
discussion about are there such things

1068
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,400
as indicas and sativas is

1069
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,640
like yes there definitely are in terms

1070
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,880
of if you're looking at pure land races

1071
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,879
yeah real land

1072
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,680
races um there are these clearly

1073
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,000
distinct types there's also of course

1074
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:45,000
some integrating between them even in

1075
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
pure land races some some Landes are

1076
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,280
likely to have Arisen through mixing of

1077
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,639
these types uh but of course once you

1078
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,480
move into the context of what you're

1079
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:59,480
going to find at most dispensaries or

1080
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,280
seed banks uh like Canabis internet seat

1081
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,559
banks that is yeah most of what you're

1082
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,800
going to find is is a indic sativa

1083
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:09,240
hybrid so this terminology becomes

1084
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:12,920
meaningless in in often most of the time

1085
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:12,919
in those contexts you know

1086
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,559
yeah important Point too like especially

1087
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:21,880
uh from people that in in the US that

1088
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,760
can go to collectives and stuff and

1089
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,680
they're seeing Inda hybrid sativa and

1090
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,680
they feel like they have a pretty good

1091
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:31,440
work working knowledge of what what each

1092
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,759
is and um quite often I mean I don't

1093
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:38,119
really see anything to narrow Lea

1094
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,920
anywhere you know or no not at all it's

1095
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,480
problem because

1096
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,119
um

1097
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,159
um that's how cannabis goes extinct you

1098
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,559
know yeah biodiversity and cannabis

1099
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,480
primarily disappears through

1100
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:53,319
hybridization you know yeah

1101
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,440
so uh this impulse that most people have

1102
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:58,119
to like hybridize everything when they

1103
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,358
CU it is fun you know like see what

1104
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:02,880
happens yeah actually the most exciting

1105
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:05,880
thing you can do really these days

1106
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,838
especially is to actually keep some

1107
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,519
pristine lines going that you haven't

1108
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:14,119
outcrossed because that's the

1109
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:16,440
basis of uh everything really and once

1110
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:18,559
we've got to a point where all we've got

1111
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,679
a hybridized lines then it becomes

1112
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,040
impossible to to do breeding doesn't

1113
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:25,159
become impossible but you can't make
