welcome to reader Syndicate 3.0 the next

00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,638
evolution of the look into

00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,000
counterculture that is Canon my name is

Matthew owner of Riot seeds and this

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,320
started as a one-man mission for strain

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,160
history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,599
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
Illuminati and other friends throughout

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,039
the seasons to hear their takes on grow

[Music]

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,799
Syndicate nice um so I can talk a little

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,439
bit about what I've done the last two

21
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,640
years um a little more in depth but uh

22
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,358
I've generally run and build a soil

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,120
soils they're really easy and here in

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,800
Colorado at least they've been

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,118
relatively cheap

26
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,679
um I do try to remend all my pots after

27
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:08,560
flower I throw I break everything down I

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,960
throw it back into the build a soil bag

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,960
and I literally just layer with

30
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,199
amendments and I would just leave them

31
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,719
on my balcony for months until I needed

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,478
more soil and I'd go right back to them

33
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,118
um but for when I was actually

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,118
transplanting into pots in one gallons

35
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,280
when I was trying to pack enough food

36
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,519
into heavier feeders I would do

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,519
something like fill up the pot maybe a

38
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,599
third of the way just so it's open and

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,239
easy

40
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:38,719
and then I would slowly add a handful of

41
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:40,959
worm castings um usually around a cup is

42
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:45,039
of worm castings and then I'll do a cup

43
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:48,239
of compost a cup a pinch of something

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,320
like Kashi Blend or um a a lighter

45
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,158
quicker release Amendment mix just

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,919
something to kind of give it a little

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,399
bit boost of immediate food within the

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,439
actual media and then I'll go a little

49
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,359
bit more soil and then another cup of

50
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,000
compost another cup of worm castings and

51
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,159
kind of just slowly mix it all together

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,479
within the pot then create my hole and

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,520
Transplant directly from clone um that

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
would usually fill up my I run the

55
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,879
plastic one gallon bags just the cheapy

56
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:19,199
ones um I don't like air pruning pots or

57
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:22,359
fabric pots I found that they um are

58
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,959
really good homes for fungus knats or

59
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,239
root AIDS and both of those really suck

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,080
and I would highly advise against those

61
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,878
but um that's just an off my antidotal

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,840
experience but uh I would allow the pot

63
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:39,039
to or the plant to essentially root up

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,840
within that 3/4 of a full bag and then

65
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,919
the top dress would I would literally

66
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,640
unfold the top of the bag and I would

67
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,719
just dump more worm castings and another

68
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,759
pinch of Kashi blend and then I'd throw

69
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,439
some more soil on top and kind of just

70
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,000
work it in with my fingers give it a

71
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:58,239
light pack and that would more often

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
than not there was I I think I found

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,519
maybe two or three plants in two years

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,519
years that wanted a lot more food than

75
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,959
what was in there everything else pretty

76
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,680
much allowed me to ride it out with uh

77
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,920
that like a more than content amount of

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,959
food for the plant um I it will kind of

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,679
sacrifice yield going on going that way

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,000
but that is the least of my selection

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,640
pressures um I'm entirely focused on the

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,639
high of the plant and the flavor of the

83
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,279
plant I want it to taste good and I want

84
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,399
to enjoy the effect of it if it doesn't

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,759
taste good

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,879
doesn't doesn't give me a good high I I

87
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,959
don't want anything to do with it I

88
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:40,318
don't care how much it produces um so

89
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,280
yield for me is not something that's

90
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,079
built into something that I need within

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,519
that way of growing um but it allowed me

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,959
to get a really good base level of each

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,719
feno that I ran through in that time and

94
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,640
gave me a really good idea of like okay

95
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,840
I know I need for this specific pheno it

96
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,798
needs more food at this time otherwise

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,438
it'll start yellowing on me early or

98
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,959
it'll give me a a weird color fade and I

99
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:11,438
know that that can kind of refer to like

100
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,840
maybe a phosphorus issue or a calcium

101
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,719
any one of those might kind of factors

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,040
but for me personally when I'm growing

103
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,639
in those pots that's kind of the general

104
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,639
system I've roughly developed for

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,680
myself yeah Kyle any thoughts on you

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
know containers different sizes

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,038
different approaches smaller containers

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,400
ERS larger containers

109
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,079
bids uh no because I pretty much went

110
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,719
over that earlier I you know I only do

111
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,959
the one gallons and you know I used to

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,199
do the two gallons but it was just

113
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,000
taking up too much room and uh yeah I

114
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,199
found one gallons I'm able just I'm able

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,360
to do it I'm able to get it through uh

116
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,759
even you know uh man I've G I've gone

117
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,680
pretty pretty long in one gallons

118
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,639
actually well I talk I think I talked

119
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,800
about that last time I had an Isa ha I

120
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,800
mean that thing just kept going and

121
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,720
going and going in a one gallon and it

122
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,120
was it it was P it was past1 20 days I

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,039
mean easily and it just never ran out of

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,478
whatever so I just don't I I never

125
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:12,319
understood it um yeah so there's nothing

126
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:15,560
really too much to add I don't think

127
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,120
so no that's all good uh bum any any

128
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,879
other prompts from this topic of like

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,840
pot sizes and stuff yeah I can kind of

130
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,199
do like a rough little Treatise on like

131
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,959
beds versus bigger pots and smaller pots

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,800
from my understanding

133
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,599
um it it's seems that beds are the most

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,199
convenience are like the most convenient

135
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,160
in my opinion um because it's kind of

136
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,079
like a set it and forget it for the most

137
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,960
part minus the occasional top dressing

138
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:45,439
and amending that it needs to go on in

139
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:47,399
between or in the flower cycle um but my

140
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,279
one issue that I do have with beds is

141
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:53,519
that if you do get any sort of soil bur

142
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,439
pathogen you're essentially screwed um

143
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:59,159
like if you're running a bed and

144
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,719
something like fusarium gets into it

145
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,880
like just horrible luck but I don't

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,560
necessarily know if there's a way that

147
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,399
you can save that from infecting

148
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,639
everything else that's within that same

149
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,198
media um obviously that would have to be

150
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,240
done from like a clone coming in

151
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,639
somewhere else or you Contracting it

152
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,720
from somewhere um

153
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,160
but um larger pots I feel would be like

154
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,360
the most ideal way to grow organically

155
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,639
obviously they take up a lot more space

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,919
and they're a little bit better for

157
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,519
bigger plants um so if you're confined

158
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,560
to space that's the one issue with

159
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:38,719
larger pots but I feel it's the closest

160
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,280
thing to a bed but it still allows you

161
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,639
to have multiple individuals that you're

162
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,799
taking care of rather than one large bed

163
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:50,598
that you has everything in it um smaller

164
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,000
pots are very much doable but it breaks

165
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:57,079
a lot of the traditional organic system

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,839
methodologies um and that largely comes

167
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,959
back to just being conscious of like

168
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,638
plant size going into flower like for

169
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,359
example you wouldn't want to flower a

170
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
plant

171
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,000
that's 30 something inches tall like

172
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,758
close to a meter high it's not going to

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,439
essentially go over very well because at

174
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,439
week three or four that plant's going to

175
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,839
be done with stretch and if it's a big

176
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,639
stretcher you're going to have a five

177
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,239
six foot plant that's going dry every

178
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,800
five to six hours because it has to

179
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,519
drink that much water to keep itself

180
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,120
alive and your media just can't contain

181
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,198
that much water

182
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,079
so it's like um there's different ways

183
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,478
to do it for different people and so you

184
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,038
can do like the small pot with smaller

185
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,519
plants and you can run like a larger

186
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,800
amount of fenos in a smaller space uh if

187
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,799
you have the space and that's not an

188
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,240
issue and you're kind of just looking

189
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,199
for a more ease of growth like water

190
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,120
only type of method I would recommend

191
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,240
like a larger pot or even the 2x4 beds

192
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,879
like scu's doing that's a great way to

193
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,158
do even if you want to do a couple

194
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,520
larger plants you could do three maybe

195
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:05,319
four couple flip plants easily in that

196
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,839
space um so it's kind of the different

197
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,598
ways that you can go about it within the

198
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,359
different pot size you can you can do

199
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,360
pretty big ones in there right what I

200
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,199
usually try and do though is flip them

201
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:22,840
small so that I can pack in more

202
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:25,000
um because I'm I'm looking for stuff you

203
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,158
know yeah and I think to me one

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,240
obviously one high level reflection that

205
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:31,879
I have on all of this is obviously they

206
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,759
try offs with every every approach they

207
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,639
different risks with the different

208
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,599
containers um and okay this is not in

209
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:43,799
the outline at all but I thought I would

210
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,920
ask you guys like what have been some

211
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,399
speaking of risks right what have what

212
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,919
are something that have gone wrong for

213
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,600
you guys just as like a a little break

214
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,240
from the you know the other topics like

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
what are some of the the major like

216
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,000
fuckups that have occurred or not

217
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
fuckups necessarily because it's not

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,958
always your fault but

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,519
yeah what are some of the biggest

220
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:07,958
disasters you guys have

221
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:11,560
encountered uh my first run in a 2x4 I

222
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:15,559
had two 20 gallon pots in there with two

223
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:18,078
plants I put the seeds in the pot and

224
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:22,159
literally started that plants at

225
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:26,559
1212 um I overwatered one of them on

226
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:30,039
like I want to say something like day 20

227
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:34,639
something when the plant was like in

228
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:38,120
tall and it just fell over and like

229
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:41,159
literally went Wet limp wet noodle on me

230
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,519
um and so that run I yielded a total of

231
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:48,439
six grams from my other 10inch

232
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,879
lollipop so yeah no you can definitely

233
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,160
kill things real quick if you're not

234
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,159
paying

235
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:59,079
attention K Kristen any any fun

236
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:59,078
disasters to tell us about

237
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,759
uh no mine I pretty much talked about

238
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,200
last time it was pretty much that Isaac

239
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,000
Haze where I think it was pretty much

240
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,800
the heat which I'm kind of dealing with

241
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,919
now everything's doing a fox tail thing

242
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,879
because uh since I'm a night grower my

243
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,679
plants don't get time to cool down they

244
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,078
are basically growing all the time

245
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,439
because during the day it's obviously

246
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:22,958
hot and uh I can't cool it down because

247
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm in the garage so you know it's um

248
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,439
it's uh something IDE deal around it's

249
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,120
just looks because in TLO anyway my

250
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,640
plants are not going to look like any

251
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,120
in any other organic system or

252
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,480
synthetic um so I have to always

253
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,078
remember that too my stuff definitely is

254
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,120
won't look like other people's when they

255
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:45,799
finish all that too so um but every but

256
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,720
pretty much I've dealt with all the

257
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,439
little problems that have come along you

258
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,560
know overwatering

259
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,560
underwatering uh mostly I deal with a

260
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,879
lot of potassium because of obviously

261
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:59,838
with the heat uh my plants are exerting

262
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,078
a lot of um moisture and stuff during

263
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,519
their nighttime so I am constantly

264
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:07,559
dealing with that uh but I don't ever

265
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,078
try to uh Goose them or you know put

266
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,958
extra stuff in them because then that'll

267
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:13,439
obviously mess stuff up especially uh

268
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,599
during the second half of flour um

269
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,040
because from what I understand

270
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,720
especially phosphorous the plant holds

271
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:22,078
it for about 20 days or so so I never do

272
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,839
anything do the second half of flour or

273
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,319
anything like that

274
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,880
um yeah I think that's but that's pretty

275
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,639
much the only major one that I've had

276
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,600
I've had bugs and stuff like that from

277
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,120
maybe the compost but that was mostly

278
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,959
when I was in my apartment when I was

279
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,200
first starting out and that was only for

280
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:40,479
like six months um I had all the the

281
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,879
fungus Nats and stuff because I was

282
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,159
trying to do the compost inside and yeah

283
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,919
that's fun trying to get rid of all

284
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,480
those in an apartment when you had to

285
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,759
worry about inspections and stuff like

286
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,480
that so that that was a fun learn fun

287
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,559
fun learning experience luckily I could

288
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,879
just took it right inside my uh my front

289
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,078
door and everything eventually went away

290
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,240
so I eventually I eventually figured it

291
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,479
out and uh yeah luckily we got a house

292
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,039
and so but uh yeah I just kind of deal

293
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,600
with stuff as it comes up but I got the

294
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,759
basic problems bugs come up and you know

295
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,839
you just deal with them and know with my

296
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:17,559
IPM or whatever I do so yeah that's

297
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:21,720
basically it for me thanks Kyle

298
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:25,518
screw uh yeah I got a couple of mess ups

299
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,720
uh first first round in the bed because

300
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,159
I I I flower in 2x4s because when I

301
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,639
first started uh growing again I was

302
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,958
also in an apartment and I had to do it

303
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,198
all in the

304
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:42,159
2x4

305
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:44,000
um and I I don't know I guess I realized

306
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,679
that plants don't really drink much

307
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,278
towards the end of

308
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:52,519
flowering uh because

309
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,480
I watered in six gallons of water like

310
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,519
it was because they were just

311
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,180
raging I watered it in and it completely

312
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,198
destroyed that

313
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:08,679
[Laughter]

314
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:11,679
carpet I uh also um you know uh the

315
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:15,519
little isopods those little pill

316
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:18,559
bugs well yeah yeah they're beneficial

317
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,480
to an extent yeah when they get to a

318
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,679
high enough population they start eating

319
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,039
your plants like chewing them down like

320
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:29,679
they're like they're beavers it's crazy

321
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,159
it's and I had that problem uh

322
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,239
for quite a

323
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,360
bit uh if you end up running into that

324
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,399
just use a beer trap it's the fastest

325
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,480
way to just knock them

326
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:46,198
out and then I mean I guess the M the

327
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,720
MIT and Thro issue that I got from that

328
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:50,359
clone that I've

329
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,320
received

330
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,680
uh clone you know that kind of [ __ ] my

331
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,519
[ __ ] for a while uh I wasn't able to

332
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,039
flower for

333
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,560
months yeah just

334
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:06,439
terrible but I don't think that's really

335
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,638
system uh system dependent I definitely

336
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,880
I guess it it is a lot harder though

337
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,639
because you know with thrips I'm pretty

338
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:18,919
sure that those you know

339
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:20,560
um like infect soil and stuff so yeah

340
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,919
they oh I was gonna say yes I know a lot

341
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,719
of people don't know they will hibernate

342
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,958
in soil because actually I get them once

343
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,240
it starts to heat up here uh so I deal

344
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,958
with that every every year so I have to

345
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,680
use the bring up the spinet and um yeah

346
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,599
but they they will hybernate soil that's

347
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,799
not a lot I had to kind of dig in the

348
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,839
research surprisingly for that but yeah

349
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,758
I found that out that they will do that

350
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,480
and that's from people also over the

351
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,720
years finding out that they get the same

352
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,039
thing it's mostly when it's the heat

353
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,959
once it starts to heat up they come out

354
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:52,278
of the soil

355
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:54,838
so I mean yeah and I will point out that

356
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:57,000
I guess being you know having a large

357
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,120
bed kind of goes back to what bomat was

358
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,639
saying I think or at least alluding to

359
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,519
which is that it's harder it's much

360
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,240
harder for you to like separate you know

361
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,919
quarantine individuals from each other

362
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,639
right like they're all in the one thing

363
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,679
and so they're one system essentially

364
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:15,159
one

365
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:18,559
ecosystem yeah that is there that is

366
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:21,078
definitely a big drawback to it

367
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,518
um and you know like when you're when

368
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:24,239
you're leaving it in there a lot of

369
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,839
people just leave their they'll just cut

370
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,480
the base of their plant and like leave

371
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:33,839
the root ball and all that [ __ ] but over

372
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:37,120
years you're asking for um those uh root

373
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:41,199
nematodes and [ __ ] to pop up yeah it's

374
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:47,318
more Victors right of like possible yeah

375
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:50,359
yeah so like I I have to I water in um

376
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:53,719
predatory nean toads every

377
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,839
month about every four or five weeks I

378
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,680
water them in just to try

379
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:03,000
and you know have a chance at it at at

380
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:05,159
keeping that at Bay um but I might

381
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,039
switch over to just replacing my soil

382
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,360
every three years because that seems to

383
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,000
be the point where it's still just

384
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,039
rocking and not not having I'm not

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,519
having to deal with too much you

386
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:22,559
know yeah

387
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
yeah okay I feel like this might be a I

388
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,879
feel like this might be a good time to

389
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,800
slide into maybe a little bit of IPM

390
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,278
tips and tricks

391
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:33,159
for yeah yeah yeah yeah go for it man

392
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:35,919
kick it off all right um so I use a

393
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:38,159
couple different things um I was given a

394
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,039
bottle of pyganic it's a insecticide and

395
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,958
fungicide I know it's not necessarily

396
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:45,559
organic but that [ __ ] really helps it's

397
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:49,758
super expensive um like almost

398
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:52,278
prohibitively expensive um but it really

399
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,480
does help um if you're having like any

400
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:57,000
type of insect like insect soft body

401
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,199
insect problems or like major fungus

402
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,480
issues um I'm not entirely sure about

403
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:06,279
root like drenching it kind of thing um

404
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,000
but for any like powdery mildew or

405
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,720
anything that's actually eating the bi

406
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,318
like biomass of the plant that goes a

407
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,600
really long way um otherwise I honestly

408
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:21,918
got my IPM recipe that I've been using

409
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:26,038
for years now from uh the one of the

410
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:29,600
episodes on the podcast um but uh it's

411
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:32,400
essentially just um Dr br

412
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:36,798
mint soap the

413
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,840
um at 1 o per gallon um if you're really

414
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,918
like dealing with something on your Leaf

415
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,519
surface I would recommend maybe doing 2

416
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,840
ounces per gallon but definitely make

417
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,319
sure those plants are dry before you

418
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,639
throw them back under the

419
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:51,480
lights um the this the mint will

420
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,600
absolutely destroy your leaves if you

421
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,279
put light on it so uh don't do that I've

422
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,240
learned that lesson as well um also

423
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:02,319
doing something like 1 ounce per gallon

424
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,798
of ice ISO 99% isopropyl or um 3%

425
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,439
hydrogen peroxide super great for

426
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,639
killing any sort of powdery mildew

427
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,558
problems um couple days back to back in

428
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,400
a row of the mixture of the two should

429
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:18,839
pretty much cure any issue with that um

430
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,159
the Dr Bronner's bastile Soap is super

431
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,839
great for any type of uh soft body

432
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,400
insect that you want to get rid of in

433
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:27,879
your actual media um they breathe

434
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
through pores on their sides so it

435
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,520
essentially does the same kind of thing

436
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,880
as um like horticultural oil where it

437
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,319
when you get it wet and you foam it up

438
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,840
and you shake it and then you spray it

439
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:43,079
into your uh or pour it into your um

440
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,879
soil it will

441
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,119
cause essentially a oil coating to go

442
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,960
over those pores and the insects

443
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:54,119
immediately suffocate and die so it's

444
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,679
the same um mode of action in that uh

445
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,759
you can also do things like um a

446
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,600
saponite extract from something like

447
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:05,640
soap nuts for like a really good um

448
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:10,918
foler to help aid with just any type of

449
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,240
um uh like mildew or PM type issue uh

450
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,559
there's all sorts of other ones I can

451
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,558
get into but I'll let the other two

452
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,279
start yeah guys

453
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,799
IPM but I mean scon already touched on

454
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:26,158
his I guess so Kyle uh yeah uh basically

455
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:28,319
the only thing I really do is I use

456
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:31,159
double death Nemos from uh Nature's

457
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,759
control uh I use that in my soil uh

458
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,880
every they called what it's called

459
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,038
they're called double death nematodes

460
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,080
they called double death that's dou

461
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,038
death yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what so

462
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,678
yeah it definitely takes out everything

463
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:46,919
you won't see anything uh flying around

464
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,480
or moving around for a little while and

465
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,240
the plants actually enjoy it you can

466
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,038
actually see them they they perk up a

467
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,519
little bit uh I've always used those

468
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,000
because obviously like I I said I found

469
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,319
out that the thrips they will stay in

470
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,919
the soil so I definitely I do use that

471
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,519
every maybe 60 days or so um you you're

472
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,880
supposedly supposed to be able to use

473
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,119
that as a foler I've never used that uh

474
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,200
I don't really do any of that stuff um

475
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,000
except when I do see if I do start to

476
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,080
get see the thrips because something

477
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,319
happened or they came in I just use the

478
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:20,798
spin aad and um I use uh I mulch so I

479
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,079
don't really have to like cover my soil

480
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,000
or anything like that and I just take

481
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,158
take them in the bathtub and spray them

482
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,558
and till they're dry and then put them

483
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:34,400
back in um I really don't have too much

484
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:36,440
of an IPM cuz uh bugs are normal for me

485
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,038
if I don't see bugs then Uh something's

486
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,759
going not not right because it

487
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,839
technically it is leaving because so if

488
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,960
I don't see a bunch of stuff uh as long

489
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,759
as it's not on the plants uh they're

490
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,440
micro microbes is you know how we think

491
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:55,440
of them um uh yeah you know I kind of

492
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,440
want to see living stuff

493
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,798
so I got a couple more tips and tricks

494
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,080
uh I just thought of um diet Tous Earth

495
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,400
super super helpful with like anything

496
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,038
that you want to essentially like

497
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,798
overpopulation of anything in your soil

498
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,879
um I would imagine it's probably really

499
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,400
good for something like a uh root aphids

500
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,960
or even fungus gnats um I've seen it

501
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,559
work wonders personally on fungus knats

502
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,400
um also a mustard seed meal uh I was

503
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:25,119
very skeptical when I first came across

504
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,480
this but I found a white paper a while

505
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,719
back I'll have to dig in and see if I

506
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,679
can find it um the essentially said uh

507
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,159
it it it was the first time I've ever

508
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:35,880
seen this term but

509
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,320
biofumigation uh essentially what

510
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,240
happens is when you put the actual

511
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,240
mustard seed meal onto the soil and you

512
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,640
get it wet what happens is the actual

513
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,200
fumigation process where the top couple

514
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,880
inches which is where the majority of

515
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,080
your issues will reside if there's an

516
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,760
overpopulation of any type will

517
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,359
essentially get fumigated out by

518
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:58,079
poisonous mustard gas that's released

519
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,678
once it gets wet um I've done it a

520
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,798
couple times when I've had a fungus net

521
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,600
issue in flour like just a light

522
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,720
sprinkle of like a teaspoon or so on my

523
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:11,119
soil get it wet and usually within two

524
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,960
or three days it's pretty much 90%

525
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,359
knocked out whatever the problem is um

526
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,519
that one's super super

527
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,519
helpful I had one more but I lost

528
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:25,038
it that's all

529
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,960
right

530
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:31,038
um there was and I don't know if you you

531
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,679
want to move bumat but uh I saw that

532
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,158
there was also mention of pH management

533
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,519
uh was that an was that something you

534
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,919
want to get into yeah we can talk on it

535
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:45,480
a little bit um so we can do like

536
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,600
different perspectives on ph um for me

537
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,919
personally I don't

538
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:54,319
whatsoever at all um I've never owned

539
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,080
one I don't think you need one to grow

540
00:22:54,319 --> 00:23:01,798
good weed in soil um but I do think they

541
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:04,519
can only help uh the reasons I don't pH

542
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,319
anything is because first of all those

543
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,798
meters are damn expensive and they are

544
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,480
not made the last those things break so

545
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:16,400
easy and they are not cheap to replace

546
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,519
at all um so that's the first reason and

547
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,840
then the second the second major reason

548
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,158
is that if you're looking at the theory

549
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,839
theoretically your if you have a healthy

550
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,120
organic system the media should itself

551
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,759
should act as a pH buffer

552
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,278
so you're not NE like when you're

553
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,599
feeding in an organic system you're

554
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:37,599
feeding more so the fun like the fungus

555
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:39,278
and the bacteria than anything else and

556
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,319
that's what's facilitating that exchange

557
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:44,519
of food within the media so you don't

558
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,278
necessarily need to moderate the pH

559
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,440
because the microbes themselves and

560
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,079
their natural

561
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,840
populations and the fungus or the fungal

562
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,399
Network within the that media are

563
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:58,199
actually what

564
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,278
exchange um the pH back and forth so

565
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,278
like I've I've w i I brought home a a pH

566
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:06,119
uh meter from work one day just out of

567
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:07,759
curiosity to test what my watering can

568
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,839
was because I just have one of those

569
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,158
cheapy weed sprayers from the Home Depot

570
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:15,798
it's like a $10 pump sprayer kind of

571
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,200
thing I dipped the pH meter in there and

572
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:20,359
it was reading like 3.7 I watered in

573
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
that night and I came back and

574
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,678
everything was praying just fine I

575
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,159
didn't have any issues whatsoever with

576
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,480
that so it's like off antidotal

577
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,039
experience and myself I've never NE seen

578
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,960
a necessity to have a pH meter if you're

579
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,960
growing in like a organic

580
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:45,480
system thoughts from the other

581
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:49,480
two yeah well just about the whole pH um

582
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,440
in your medium in a in like a proper you

583
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,880
know the type of potting soil that we're

584
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,640
trying to create it's that pH isn't even

585
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:03,480
constant throughout the media

586
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:07,679
um it Alters based on you know what micr

587
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,599
population is there in like you know

588
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:14,320
within the media so even I don't know

589
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:17,240
even just given it um as long as your pH

590
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:20,319
is relatively fine which most people

591
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:24,120
have normal water coming out of their

592
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:27,240
sinks uh you should be all

593
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:29,119
right and if you're curious about that

594
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,359
water tests are actually pretty cheap

595
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,319
you you can pretty much find them

596
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,079
locally wherever you are at least here

597
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,720
in the US can't speak about kiwis sorry

598
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:39,678
thousand um but yeah you can get that

599
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,200
tested super easily you can pretty much

600
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,600
send it off anywhere there's a lot of

601
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,480
places that do it you just pop in Google

602
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,119
and it'll come up um but that'll give

603
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,798
you like a full breakdown of what's

604
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,759
actually in your water coming out of

605
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:54,038
your faucet and if you need to do

606
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,879
anything um in the US a lot of tap a lot

607
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:59,359
of tap systems run a small amount of

608
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,080
chlorine in there to prevent uh any type

609
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:05,519
of uh buildup within pipes so I if I

610
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,558
ever ran something out of the faucet I'd

611
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,079
make sure I'd put it through something

612
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,558
like a brida filter or just a really

613
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,960
simple like one stage water filter to

614
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,798
try and get as much of that out as

615
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,600
possible it's not going to be absolutely

616
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:19,278
perfect but it will definitely help or

617
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:23,398
you can let it sit out if it's regular

618
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,398
chlorine it'll dissipate over

619
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,839
time that's cool I think just randomly

620
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,640
but where I am you can actually get

621
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,038
reports uh I think they're Reports

622
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,919
online from like your local Council

623
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,440
whatever what people um and they tell

624
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,799
you like since they last test in

625
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,759
monitoring like what how much of what is

626
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:47,000
in the water which is pretty

627
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:49,319
cool that's how it is here too I think

628
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
they do it like quarterly or

629
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:55,240
something

630
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,159
yeah um anything else on this topic bum

631
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,440
cat I think that kind of covers that

632
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,120
one um yeah and for for what I use for

633
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,558
pH is this Dolomite lime so I try to get

634
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,359
mine about 77.0 which is neutral because

635
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:14,000
I believe that that's basically what

636
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:16,879
most cannabis likes uh you know what

637
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,398
I've at least found um i i ph I did have

638
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,799
a meter in the very beginning when I

639
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,359
made my very very first batch of soil

640
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,798
and it was exactly what uh was in the

641
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:28,359
book so it was after that I never Ed it

642
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,240
and actually the thing just uh broke I

643
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,278
don't even know what happened to

644
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,120
whatever that this fancy the blue lab

645
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,038
pen was it was fancy after a while I

646
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,038
looked at it and I was like oh the

647
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:38,398
thing's broke anyway so I I and I've

648
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:40,558
never Ed one but uh I use fast acting

649
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,558
Dolomite Lime In My Water I send it

650
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,079
through a filter uh tap through a filter

651
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,918
first and um then I build my water up

652
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,759
with a fast acting build in my lime for

653
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:52,200
to get it to 7.0 basically so and then

654
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,119
obviously I have stuff in my soil that

655
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,240
buffers it to that because I have more

656
00:27:54,119 --> 00:28:00,558
do of my lime and the soil and that type

657
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,319
of stuff so I will say um I've heard Tad

658
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,119
hussy from Kiss Organics who he has like

659
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,599
a whole podcast where he gets like

660
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,678
really deep into soil science and stuff

661
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,719
um I've heard him recommend between like

662
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,360
6.5 and 6.7 in general if you're using

663
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,720
like a living soil type system so if you

664
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,079
are looking to pH something in a solil

665
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,839
system I would recommend aiming for

666
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,079
somewhere in that range yeah that's

667
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,720
funny you said because I believe mine

668
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,000
was in the very beginning AKA was at 6.7

669
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,120
once everything was all cooked and

670
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,119
everything after about 30 days so

671
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:40,678
boom so we have I would say maybe 20 to

672
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:43,440
30 minutes left and uh bumat there are a

673
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,440
couple of what was this so there's like

674
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,840
growing organically and confined spaces

675
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,960
we sort of have touched on that I don't

676
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,599
know if that's something you wanted to

677
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,159
talk more about and then we have General

678
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:57,798
tips and maybe like controversial points

679
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,200
discussion uh I'll let you decide like

680
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:02,038
you know what do you reckon we should

681
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:06,919
talk about um I feel like we can go into

682
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:10,839
the general tips area um I have a couple

683
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:13,320
down um but at least for me come like

684
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,639
learning the system um the biggest

685
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:20,079
pitfalls coming into growing indoors um

686
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,759
organically is watering and not knowing

687
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,960
what or why you're watering at um like

688
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,960
specific

689
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,000
additives um everything that you put in

690
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,079
your water to go into to your media you

691
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,960
should have a general understanding of

692
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,678
what's relatively going to be happening

693
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,079
um and the amount of water that you're

694
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,600
putting into your soil um I Heard screw

695
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,798
mentioned six gallons earlier I've done

696
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,959
very similar things and found that all

697
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:49,359
of a sudden the plant is just it's you

698
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,440
might as well just cut it out because

699
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:55,798
it's not going to grow anymore

700
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,480
um but yeah I believe that

701
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:01,000
essentially watering and understanding

702
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,360
what's in that water and why you're

703
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,880
doing that is a huge one um if you don't

704
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,918
know ask questions you would be

705
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,240
absolutely amazed at who is willing to

706
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,600
answer you um my DMs are always open if

707
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,319
anybody ever has any questions obviously

708
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,319
but I've gone to Growers that I really

709
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,599
respect on Instagram and I've just sent

710
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,000
them a DM out of out of the blue hoping

711
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,000
maybe that they can get back to me with

712
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,519
an answer and more often than not it's

713
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,839
like 90% of the time somebody will come

714
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,880
back and give you some really good

715
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:35,240
advice or maybe something to think about

716
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,240
that can help it's all people are always

717
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,359
there don't be afraid and don't be don't

718
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,720
let your ego not let you ask questions

719
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:43,479
there's always something to learn and

720
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,798
somebody can always teach you something

721
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,679
even if it's wrong you'll learn that

722
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:49,679
it's wrong eventually

723
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:55,599
um organic join our Discord that's the

724
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,278

00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,240
Shilling yeah join join the community

days I'm not

730
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,398
sure or maybe it was just there but I

731
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,960
guess there are a number of threads in

732
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:12,918
it now that's cool I haven't actually

733
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,399
looked into it in a bit yeah go give it

734
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:16,240
a read if you're in the Discord it's

735
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,079
it's super fun everybody's really nice

and always willing to help um

737
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,678
everybody's pretty positive in there and

738
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:25,480
always a good time um but uh biggest

739
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,798
advice for growing in Organics in

740
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,038
general is keep it simple this plant can

741
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:34,599
get really complicated really really

742
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:37,158
really fast don't over complicate things

743
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:40,678
if you're confused just fall back to the

744
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,120
basics water and soil if the food if

745
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,120
there's food in the media the plant will

746
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:47,398
feed itself if you're worried about

747
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,479
overwatering give it a couple hours come

748
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,319
back and check on it there's more than a

749
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,679
million ways to come back and come like

750
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:55,918
look at the plant to make sure it's okay

751
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,559
um a lot of people like to drown their

752
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,360
plants with love that's a very common

753
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,440
mistake as well in Organics um

754
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,240
cleanliness in general everything in

755
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,360
Organics is about staying five steps

756
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,960
ahead of all the pests in every regard

757
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:12,599
it's an absolute pain in the ass but

758
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,759
it's essentially really the only way um

759
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:17,319
if you get a really

760
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:21,319
bad overpopulation of something in your

761
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:23,278
soil if you get like uh like isopods

762
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:25,638
were mentioned earlier or fungus nads or

763
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,119
root aphids if you're in an individual

764
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:29,079
pot you can pull that pot out and get

765
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,398
rid of that plant

766
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:34,359
um but there is also the thought that

767
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,839
don't be afraid to run a crop till

768
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:39,199
Harvest um even if you panic and think

769
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,079
it's going to be run uh like ruined you

770
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,440
can always learn something from taking

771
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,240
something to the end um I've taught

772
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,679
myself a whole bunch of stuff of like

773
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,440
you can rebound a plant pretty well even

774
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:54,519
when you think it's

775
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:57,278
gone sometimes you can just baby it back

776
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,319
um another big one is don't be rying on

777
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,880
specific companies or products uh

778
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,158
meaning if you find something you get a

779
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,559
positive result from keep using it but

780
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,399
also understand what the ingredients are

781
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:09,558
in that product that's creating that

782
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:11,599
positive reaction that you want so that

783
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:14,879
way if the product ever goes out of

784
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,558
stock or is no no longer sold you have a

785
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,799
means of understanding what was

786
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:19,480
happening and you can go find a

787
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:22,599
replacement product that is just as good

788
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,519
or maybe even better

789
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:28,079
um yeah that's kind of my my general

790
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,919
tips for Organics

791
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:34,558
what about yeah Kyle and scren you know

792
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,919
on reflection you know what would you

793
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,158
what would you what advice would you

794
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,038
give people who are maybe starting or

795
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,039
thinking about starting

796
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,959
organic yeah I would definitely uh start

797
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:50,359
out I would have started out more simple

798
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,038
uh you know I I delve right in but I

799
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:53,959
kind of knew what I wanted to do

800
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:57,000
beforehand because I'd already you know

801
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,639
I already started you know reading about

802
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,200
stuff and doing all so I kind of knew

803
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:03,959
beforehand but uh yeah because you can

804
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,360
do basic real basic stuff and um luckily

805
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,200
with the rev's new book I mean he has

806
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,519
real simple recipes that you can do to

807
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,878
even just do trial runs so that way if

808
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,878
it's uh something that uh you just don't

809
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,319
like you you know you didn't waste a lot

810
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:17,319
of time

811
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:23,398
um again as well yeah yeah and like I

812
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,118
yeah I mean bum cat he pretty much a lot

813
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,319
of the stuff he just said was you know

814
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,320
it's pretty good you know um you know I

815
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,919
don't stay ahead of the pest maybe as I

816
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,240
should but you know to like I said you

817
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:34,918
know uh I like to see stuff because my

818
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,358
system is a little bit different than

819
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:40,319
just a basic uh well not basic but just

820
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,838
a the normal living soil of what people

821
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,200
think type of thing because T is its own

822
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:47,199
thing uh in and of itself

823
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:56,440
so cool man thank you scren any yeah

824
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:58,838
tips uh probably the the biggest tips I

825
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:02,039
don't I guess

826
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:05,358
the most problems I see people having

827
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:07,159
are watering either too little or too

828
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,679
much or too

829
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:11,759
frequent

830
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:14,239
um and like light

831
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,599
intensity most most of the time if you

832
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:20,159
just if if you got like problems going

833
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:22,680
on either dim your lights or raise them

834
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,759
and focus in on how you're

835
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:28,559
watering and that until you start to

836
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,000
actually learn this system a little bit

837
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,920
better that is going to be most of your

838
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,199
problems cuz you see people

839
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,200
who you know start out oh is it a is it

840
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,639
a MAG issue is it a you know calcium

841
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:48,399
problem you know when really they just

842
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:50,759
need to be more consistently um watering

843
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,240
correctly yeah yeah I definitely have

844
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,000
seen this a lot where you can get from

845
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,239
watering issues you you do get

846
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,119
Downstream lockout deficiency issues so

847
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:05,399
it's not always a direct diagnosis like

848
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,800
if you see uh you know Leaf closis

849
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,720
necrosis it doesn't immediately mean

850
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,119
that it's a nutrient issue although it

851
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:15,239
it could be a nutrient issue but it

852
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,160
could be caused by an upstream watering

853
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:20,519
problem right and that's where people

854
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:23,000
got especially when they new and um

855
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,759
instantly try to like change

856
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,199
five uh and just get like way more

857
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,200
confused way more lost

858
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,159
in

859
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:34,838
troubleshooting yeah especially with

860
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,598
overw watery because uh I I'm I'm

861
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,239
constant over that's one that's my main

862
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,680
thing even since I was first starting

863
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,399
you know that's mostly what a lot of

864
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,639
people do is overwater over love stuff

865
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,880
and I I still am I still have that

866
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:49,118
problem of slightly overwatering stuff

867
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,760
um and that that what I believe causes a

868
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,920
potassium issue which then causes

869
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,560
magnesium and all kinds of lockouts and

870
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,599
stuff afterward so which is which

871
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,279
actually which usually is what you see a

872
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:03,160
lot of the organic a lot of the

873
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,079
droopiness and that's usually the what i

874
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:07,318
is usually the overwatering you can

875
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:10,280
really see it especially in the organic

876
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:10,279
beds and stuff like

877
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,200
that a really good general rule I've

878
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,200
found uh based off of experience that I

879
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,480
got from um one of the build- of soil

880
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:22,879
videos way back in the day was uh

881
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,240
roughly F you want to water roughly

882
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,519
about 5 to 10% of your total uh volume

883
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,318
of soil if you're watering in Organics

884
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,639
um so for example if you're in like a 10

885
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:35,759
gallon pot you're going to water water

886
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:40,078
somewhere in the range of a half gallon

887
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,040
to a whole gallon total for every time

888
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,200
that you water that's obviously not

889
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:46,159
going to be that exactly every single

890
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,759
time it's going to be very much based on

891
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,639
individuals and their preferences um but

892
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,920
that generally will give you a really

893
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:56,358
good guide of watering but not

894
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,119
overwatering or overloving the plant

895
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:01,480
when you're actually going back in

896
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,480
um doing

897
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:08,799
that

898
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,920
awesome okay um any

899
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,839
other I don't know yeah anything else

900
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,440
here bumat General

901
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:20,880
tips uh don't be relying on any

902
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,559
individual um that's right be diversify

903
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,480
your sources of information somebody can

904
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:28,000
always teach you something no matter

905
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,800
what you've heard from somebody else um

906
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,400
if they're doing something wrong you'll

907
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,800
learn in time that you're doing

908
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,358
something wrong or if you're willing to

909
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,000
do the research you might learn a little

910
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:38,679
bit faster but always diversify where

911
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,358
you're getting your information from

912
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:41,559
because somebody can always teach you

913
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:45,519
something you never know what it's going

914
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:47,519
to be is this a good point um for me to

915
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,880
ask you guys to like maybe shout out

916
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:53,039
some of the most important books

917
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,920
articles whatever that you've you've

918
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,679
found um you have any of those yeah I

919
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,519
can go a couple right off the top my

920
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:04,919
head um the knf manual super helpful um

921
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:06,559
give you gives you like really detailed

922
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,680
breakdowns of different styles of

923
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,880
fermentation and all that stuff Jam is

924
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:15,598
also very similar um you can literally

925
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,119
just pop those literally knf and j a d m

926
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,800
are the two spellings and you literally

927
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,640
just pop them into Amazon and the books

928
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,240
will pop right up they're translated

929
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,480
into pretty much every single language

930
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:27,078
you can think of they're super super

931
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,519
readable um they can get pretty in-

932
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,480
depth at certain points but they provide

933
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,639
all the necessary information in that

934
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,400
book for you to understand those uh

935
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:39,159
systems if you're looking for something

936
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,920
like living soil or um no till I would

937
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,960
really really highly recommend Jeff

938
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,440
lenell's teaming with series he's got

939
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,358
three books I believe there might be a

940
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,400
fourth one published or a fourth one on

941
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:52,318
the way I don't remember exactly um it's

942
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,680
like teaming with microbes teaming with

943
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,838
fungi um and then the I I can't remember

944
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:59,279
the third one really really highly

945
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:01,039
recommend those to anybody who's more on

946
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,519
the beginner side and just looking to

947
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:06,199
get a really good grasp of them you in

948
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,280
all honesty can just get the first book

949
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,559
The teaming with microbes and that book

950
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,240
will teach you everything you need to

951
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,039
know about the basics of soil science

952
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:15,239
it'll break it down into really simple

953
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,559
language for you really simple

954
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,879
definitions and it'll give you all the

955
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:22,759
necessary essentially foundation for you

956
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,440
to understand that system as a whole um

957
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,599
if you're not into reading I would

958
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,838
really really highly recommend Jeremy

959
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:32,160
Silva from build a soil their YouTube

960
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:35,960
channel has literally hundreds of hours

961
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:38,559
of high quality really in-depth um

962
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,079
content growing literally in their

963
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,639
hydroponic shop it's phenomenal um I've

964
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,280
actually met Jeremy in person he's a

965
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,559
really great guy um grows great weed too

966
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,440
I can say that 100% he's he's given me

967
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,400
samples of a couple things and

968
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,079
everything I've smoked him has been

969
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,800
amazing so I those systems do work

970
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,400
really well I would recommend all of

971
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,079
those sources is um if you're more of an

972
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,280
old form kind of guy I would recommend

973
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,039
going looking for Clackamus cot that guy

974
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,800
will always have great information um

975
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:10,440
he's he gets very detailed very quick so

976
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,400
that might be somebody something for on

977
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,519
the little bit more advanced Spectrum

978
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,079
his uh vocabulary will get really large

979

really quick on you but uh those are a

980
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,000
general direction for if you're looking

981
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,719
for any of those types of systems and

982
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,358

983
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,719
them thank you very much Kyle scen uh

00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:32,838
any shout outs

985
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:35,199
for uh sources of

986
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:36,400
information uh yeah well I've already

987
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,118
probably pretty much mention it all the

988
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,358
time obviously the Rev uh you know he

989
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,240
has his own YouTube uh page now so now

990
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:43,759
he's starting to do that so that's kind

991
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,399
of that's a little bit better because it

992
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,520
actually shows he actually goes through

993
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,760
and shows how he does everything uh even

994
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,159
that's great yeah so even the mixing and

995
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,240
stuff he puts it on a large an example

996
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,679
of a small scale and then how you would

997
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,399
do it on a large scale so it's kind of

998
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:01,118
cool how he does it it and you know he's

999
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,800
a funny guy too so it's it's really cool

1000
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,440
um because he's just an old Stoner so

1001
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,160
and then the other ones are rodale's uh

1002
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,400
rodale's ultimate encyclopedia for

1003
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:11,239
organic gardening uh like I said it has

1004
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,160
every everything it's not just cannabis

1005
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:15,719
it has uh everything and it's a older

1006
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:18,519
book it's been around for a long long

1007
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:21,078
time uh another one's the composting for

1008
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:23,559
like recycling uh your soil and stuff

1009
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:25,519
the rodale's book of composting and uh

1010
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,519
for worms uh if you're doing any kind of

1011
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,719
worm bins uh worms eat my garbage that's

1012
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:33,358
a kids book but you know it's a older

1013
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:36,118
one but it's the basic like first worm

1014
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:39,558
book that I know of so um yeah that's

1015
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,440
really basically it that I can think of

1016
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:44,559
uh because bumat mentioned the L and

1017

Fell's books I've I've read those um and

1018
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,000
that's really pretty much all I can

1019
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,799
think of off the top of my head and

1020
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,380
looking through my closet real quick at

1021

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,199
everything on there most of it's on the

1048
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,838
Discord pretty much but uh every once in

1049
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:54,279
a while I like to post historical stuff

1050
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,759
and uh yeah you can see some of my uh

1051
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,200
plants on there too every once in a

1052
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,880
while so okay I again I'll try to

1053
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:07,719
remember to link that too um

1054
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:12,318
Christen uh I got started like down this

1055
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:17,598
path from uh from C just reading his

1056
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:22,199
stuff and uh but from there I mostly

1057
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:25,079
look at you know non Cana stuff like

1058
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:29,118
most of it is just far farming YouTubes

1059
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,599
and [ __ ] like that um um yeah no that's

1060
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,880
great though that is a good point which

1061
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:35,280
is that you can look outside of like

1062
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,160
cannabis discourse for this yeah yeah

1063
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,440
well because I mostly you know I mostly

1064
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:43,920
focus on like making my own compost and

1065
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:48,000
stuff like that uh that's that's what I

1066
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,440
you know mostly do like heavy Research

people from the community to come on the

1133
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,000
show and I think it's been a great

1134
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:52,239
direction for us to move into as uh to

1135
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,119
supplement and or complement like the

1136

other other shows that we do um it's

1137
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,880
really been I think a fun and productive

1138
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,519

his face and you see everything's

1154

written on his face whether he likes
