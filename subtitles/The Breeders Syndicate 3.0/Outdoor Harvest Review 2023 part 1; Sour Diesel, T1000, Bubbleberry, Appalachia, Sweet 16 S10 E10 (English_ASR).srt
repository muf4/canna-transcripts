00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,799
kind of are trying to experiment a

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,878
little bit with other people running it

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,599
uh but when I'm down or I have to get

25
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,799
other stuff done I mean that's always

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,039

helped a bunch with that so this week

28
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,719
it's going to be run by thousand and

35
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,679
interesting episode you guys know me I

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,159
really don't like outdoor stuff but I'm

37

real proud of it so I'm stoked to put it

39

[Music]

80
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:14,318
did um yeah so we we'll start it off

81
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:17,199
with just what what did you grow this

82
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,079
last outdoor season that really worked

83
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,878
well with you what what what were the

84
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,360
ones that stood out to you and um to in

85
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,479
in your in your mind what was your

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,840
favorite um for me personally the

87
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,679
highlight of last year's outdoor grow

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,840
were the sweet 16 hybrids that CSI sent

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,519
my way and and I I played with them and

90
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,080
I I I follow my nose a lot when it comes

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,438
to cannabis um especially for selecting

92
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,719
stuff that I like my nose is usually one

93
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:51,959
of my my main things that I aim after

94
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,680
and all of these sweet 16 hybrids were

95
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,719
just incredibly strong

96
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,719
pungent um I was just at a party a

97
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,598
couple weekends ago and I brought some

98
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,878
of the sweet 16 pineapple and every time

99
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,280
I crack the jar or people across the

100
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,039
room would go geez man what is in that

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,318
and it's just the the floral notes that

102
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,318
come off of it stand out to me out of

103
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,918
out of a lot of the stuff that I grew um

104
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:20,560
from this last year the uh and I got to

105
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,000
see its expression across um multiple

106
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,280
hybrids I tried sweet 16 to Pineapple

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,240
sweet 16 to Humble duer cut and I tried

108
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:34,159
four different sweet 16 to Kim d

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,800
and they all expressed that um wine

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,680
fermenting fruit just really strong odor

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,800
every time you crack a jar it it hits

112
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,360
you like a like like something that

113
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,800
that's almost offensive to the nose it's

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,038
uh it's so strong in its odor um so yeah

115
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,639
I this year for me the the sweet 16

116
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,680
hybrids I wasn't expecting um much out

117
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,360
of them but man they blew my socks off

118
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,680
I'm super happy that I so got to try

119
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,800
those just wanted to needle you a bit

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,879
about this cuz you're talking about uh

121
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,439
how is how are the effects are you

122
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,038
implying that the effects they're not

123
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,800
quite as strong as some of the other

124
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:20,000
plants um so the sweet 16 pineapple was

125
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,680
uh sativa leiner wasn't as strong as the

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,399
other two hybrids but um they were all

127
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,400
when I'm talking about pungent I'm I'm

128
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,799
talking about the smell specifically on

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:33,799
the nose um they were all great smoke

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,600
the sativa leaner not being as um heavy

131
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,560
but they they were all very potent very

132
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,520
resinous strain completely completely

133
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,800
covered in resin I was impressed with uh

134
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,279
I was impressed with what I saw through

135
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,520
through it the uh sweet 16 that he used

136
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,879
has a has a strong gentic backbone

137
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
because you could see the similarities

138
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,918
across the the multiple cultivar as he

139
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,918
crossed it

140
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,599
too so yeah that I mean one of of the

141
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,519
other big ones this year that I really

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,160
enjoyed from CSI was the Triangle cush

143
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,079
Girl Scout cookies um it's another one

144
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,599
of his Girl Scout cookie hybrids that I

145
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:15,680
grew that kind of just grows itself I

146
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,918
don't have to I don't have to baby it

147
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
and it just really flourishes in my

148
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,198
environment comes

149
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,080
out per like it comes out almost perfect

150
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,639
to what I prefer smoking out of cannabis

151
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:33,038
is just a really good pain relief uh has

152
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,000
great uh Citrus great great cushy smells

153
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,839
and and it looks really good in the bag

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,959
so once again continually this is the

155
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,359
fourth year in a row that I've tried a

156
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,560
couple of different Girl Scout cookie

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,199
hybrids from csi's library and they all

158
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,319
continually provide this really great

159
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,680
smoke for me um yeah I got some more

160
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,199
that I want to talk about from last year

161
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,680
but I'm going to go ahead and ask little

162
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,000
Hill you know what were some of the

163
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,918
standouts from your garden last year

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,160
what were some things that that really

165
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:09,959
stood out to you um I grew I grew a lot

166
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,120
of new stuff this year um I had a little

167
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,159
extra space to work with and I wanted to

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,000
figure out what was going to work for me

169
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,120
Outdoors um with I haven't grown

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,839
strictly outdoors in quite some time

171
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,478
it's probably been I don't know six

172
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,959
years or so or seven years and uh so

173
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,399
like you know with new strains and

174
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,000
what's what's popular I I am a

175
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,120
commercial guy

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,120
um I just had to figure out what was

177
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,639
going to work in my environment finish

178
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:43,240
and and do well for my grow style which

179
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:47,240
is pretty hands-off organic

180
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,400
um I the the standouts that I that I

181
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,158
that I that I'm going to run again next

182
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,799
year were Mochi runts and I don't know

183
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:57,639
who that strain came from it was a clone

184
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,478
from a commercial Nursery um it's a runs

185
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,519
plant but but much more vigor ous and

186
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,519
really high testing in THC and the candy

187
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,279
flavor came through and the color came

188
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,719
through and really a really a vigorous

189
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,279
plant so I was I was a little hesitant

190
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,080
to run anything runs because I generally

191
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,799
don't like it but uh that one definitely

192
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:23,120
won me over another one was papaya bomb

193
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,840
which is a papaya to THC bomb cross also

194
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,439
from a commercial Nur

195
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:32,879
Nursery um huge flowers and just a old

196
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,639
like late '90s early 2000s type of smell

197
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,278
of just like strong tropical fruit hence

198
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,479
it's name papaya um you don't see a

199
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,080
whole lot like that anymore um and it

200
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,639
really kind of takes me back to like

201
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,600
sweet tooth number three and and some of

202
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,080
the stuff I grew when I first started

203
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,519
growing so I was really happy with that

204
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,879
one um funny you should mention those

205
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,360
sweet 16 crosses in this little side

206
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,200
Garden I I had where I grew a bunch of

207
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,720
seed and uh some random clones I I

208
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,680
acquired I I did grow the sweet 16

209
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,879
clone and I I liked it a lot not for

210
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,958
commercial production but as far as

211
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,799
flavor and having something

212
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:16,559
unique um I love it I enjoy the smoke

213
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,719
it's really tasty it's not super potent

214
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,799
no but uh it's it's a fun plant and I

215
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,440
still I still held on to the Clone just

216
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,000
to figuring out if I might do something

217
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,000
with it in the future or not I'm not

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,200
sure

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,278
but um I I really did enjoy that clone

220
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,920
and I know the guys that uh Caleb got

221
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,559
those genetics from um one of them's a

222
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,599
very good friend the other one's a good

223
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,838
friend but he's he's since moved away um

224
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,959
so I kind of I knew those those the

225
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,000
precursors to that to those to those

226
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,559
genetics uh you know so which clone are

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,480
we talking about right now I forgot uh

228
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:59,958
sweet 16 um got it it's a mindo perks to

229
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:02,720
a a killer queen cross and uh

230
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,799
uh all all those guys are meno guys that

231
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,079
that I knew pretty well that we were all

232
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:10,559
doing it back in back in the the

233
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:12,879
greenrush Heyday uh so it's kind of cool

234
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,359
to see that those genetics still sort of

235
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,240
mixed up and and and

236
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,200
thriving because they are unique and and

237
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,320
it was really a time when you could you

238
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,360
could grow stuff that just like the

239
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,519
smell jumped out of the bag unlike now

240
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,800
where it really seems like smell and

241
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,720
flavors have all kind of gotten BL land

242
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:36,359
and right you know the same so it's it's

243
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:40,200
that's a fun one to grow

244
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,639
um that was my biggest uh that was my

245
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,079
biggest and like reason for liking that

246
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,399
strain was the uniqueness of it um I

247
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,000
tried the sweet 16 from Caleb and the

248
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,360
first time he cracked the jar and I put

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,679
my nose in there I was like I've never

250
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,399
smell anything like this in cannabis

251
00:10:53,679 --> 00:11:00,000
before the fermenting wine you know the

252
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,919
the blackberry wine 69

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,240
huh yeah this was at the party yeah and

254
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,799
he also had the blackberry wine um the

255
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,680
69 and both of them were like these are

256
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,639
unique turp profiles that I've never

257
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,838
smelled in a plant before and then those

258
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,759
same TPS seeing them in the uh the three

259
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,800
different hybrids that I got to try last

260
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,838
year I was like oh yeah there's shades

261
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,759
of it here but just you know little

262
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,279
influences from the kimd or little

263
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:28,278
influences from The Humble duer cut it

264
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,439
it really Shone through and basically

265
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:33,679
covered everything Frost and gave it a a

266
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,560
good nose I can imagine the the cross to

267
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,719
Pineapple was great for the nose

268
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:40,119
pineapple was another cut sort of from

269
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,480
that same era that all these same people

270
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,320
were growing in some form or fashion

271
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,800
because it's the nose jumped out of the

272
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,959
bag and and and that's really what sold

273
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,519
pot for us back then and and honestly

274
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:54,799
that clone the pineapple clone was

275
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,679
always a farm favorite for everybody so

276
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,759
and that's the stinkiest one that's the

277
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:00,439
sweet 16 pineapple man I cracked that

278
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,759
and it's like rotten pineapples and

279
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:06,240
people are looking at me like what is

280
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:10,278
that I believe it I also grew a clone in

281
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,240
my little side Garden uh from Caleb uh I

282
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:16,519
he he gave his brother a bunch of uh

283
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,600
selections from Girl Scout cookies runs

284
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,240
T1000 okay and so I I kind of I looked

285
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,000
at some of the plants he had flowered

286
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,240
out and I and I and I picked the one I

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,078
like the most um and I grew those out

288
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,399
and uh you know just kind of

289
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,439
like it's kind of like what the market

290
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,919
seems to want or what they think they

291
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:42,760
want just like per purple Frosty weed uh

292
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,599
DSE um not really my I been wanting to

293
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,679
ask you one thing little Hill like on

294
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,879
the T1000 like do you see it as a kind

295
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:56,159
of um cookies alternate or something a

296
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:58,600
way no I see it more as an Urkle

297
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,439
alternate yeah yeah that makes sense

298
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,159
yeah it because it is a URL leaning

299
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,920
phenotype of the

300
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,319
Cross and so it's got some of it's like

301
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,838
heavily

302
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,399
like favors the Urkel flavor and and it

303
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,000
is a little squat um compared to some of

304
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,039
the other phenotypes you get out of that

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,799
c

306
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:22,519
cross um but it's just it just got added

307
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:28,240
potency um added added Vigor from a

308
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:30,959
triangle Kush um yeah and uh so yeah so

309
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,759
what else did I grow the dog Waltz

310
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:37,919
s1s um I had three of those from some

311
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:40,000
really old seed yeah um that that was

312
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,439
fun it was I only got three to pop out

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,240
of 30 it was it was really really old

314
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:50,720
seed 15 years old give or take um but

315
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,600
uh one of them was pretty bland the

316
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,639
other two had that smell one of them was

317
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,600
green the other one was purple it was

318
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,039
funny to see that variation I I kept

319
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,278
cuts of both of the ones I

320
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:06,559
liked um what else did I grow this year

321
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,600
oh I grew s for the first

322
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,679
time I was G to say before you go into

323
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,120
the sour um I just want to add that I

324
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,359
don't know if I'm allowed to leak this

325
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,440
but there may

326
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,720
be uh that that

327
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,680
um the poodle nuts cut um has been found

328
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,759
maybe I can say that I don't know I'm G

329
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,278
to note that and just in case until it

330
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,519
hasn't been I don't think we've gotten

331
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:33,639
it yet from the person who said they had

332
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,519
it no though it's supposed to be on the

333
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,680
way but it's been a minute we'll see

334
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:44,000
what happens uh I know how it goes

335
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,758
everybody gets busy so we will we'll see

336
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,480
if it actually if we can actually get

337
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,720
our hands on it and if it's actually the

338
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,839
real one um I would love I it's my

339
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,440
favorite weed all time so I'm I'm really

340
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,800
looking forward to getting my hands back

341
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,399
on it and and introducing it to sort of

342
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:03,919
this modern Market um it's it's a

343
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:07,958
stinker it has a great high and uh it's

344
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:11,759
it's just my favorite weed um

345
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:15,359
so yeah those s1s uh were fun fun to

346
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,079
smoke again um it's funny how and I

347
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,120
think this is this is a good segue into

348
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:21,278
sour diesels I I grew Sour Diesel for

349
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,198
the first time in a long time and I grew

350
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,078
a lot of it back in the day because

351
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:29,519
there was strong still is strong demand

352
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:32,318
for it but um it's funny how like your

353
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,000
memory things are always better in your

354
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:37,198
memory um than than than what they what

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,159
they really were so I feel like that's

356
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,000
going on right now with sour diesel

357
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:44,120
where whether you have the the real cut

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,600
or not I feel like there's a lot of cuts

359
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,399
that are so similar they're tough to

360
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,079
tell

361
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,679
apart

362
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:53,039
um the sour diesel I grew is exactly

363
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:56,359
what I remember so so there's that but

364
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,360
the the purple Kim dog or or or the the

365
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,079
dog Waltz um sometimes I call it purple

366
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,839
Kim dog um the poodle nuts it's got a

367
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:07,679
lot of names uh I like I was smelling

368
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
these these two fenos I got and I was

369
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,799
like man is this it it's not as gassy as

370
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,680
I remember the grapes there but is the

371
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,519
gas there you know is the flavor there

372
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:18,719
doesn't really burn my nostrils and I

373
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,278
remember it burning my nostrils or is

374
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,040
this just in my head that it'll never be

375
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,720
as good as my memories of it just

376
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,318
because I've I've built up this these

377
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,040
thoughts in my head about how great it

378
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,759
was because it's my favorite of all time

379
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,318
and I think a little bit that of that's

380
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,159
going on with Sour Diesel and

381
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:38,519
everybody's saying like this isn't the

382
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,719
same one it's not as this it's not like

383
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,159
that and I'm

384
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,600
like well you know a lot of people don't

385
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:47,480
want to admit that like maybe you're

386
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,360
holding it on a pedestal in your mind

387
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,360
and it it's never gonna it's you're

388
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,480
never going to be able to find the right

389
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,600
one or grow it to what you thought it

390
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,759
was in your mind right and yeah all they

391
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
know they could have had it and it

392
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,278
thinking it wasn't and then exactly and

393
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,640
then add on like everybody's growing

394
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:09,119
under LEDs now everything's different

395
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,120
about how we grow and and in CO2 and so

396
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,159
it's like they're not being grown in

397
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:18,399
these like I mean Grow rooms in 2005

398
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,360
were were so like Stone aged compared to

399
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,759
where they're at now yeah you know with

400
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:26,159
high press sodium and carbon filters and

401
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,879
most people weren't running CO2 and and

402
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,759
and and who knows what temperature and

403
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,960
humidity fluctuations you were having at

404
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,038
night and right you know nobody was as

405
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,200
dialed in as they are now so I don't I

406
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:40,440
don't know like all those little things

407
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,798
affect the plant so dramatically um on

408
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,640
how it expresses itself especially Sour

409
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:50,319
Diesel you know um so I don't know just

410
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,960
just my thoughts on that um so that's

411
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,839
yeah that's that's that's about that's

412
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,600
about where I'm at with with what I like

413
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,639
from last

414
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,119
year it's funny you mention that with

415
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,520
sour d because cuz um I think it it also

416
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:09,000
kind of lends Credence into volatile TPS

417
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:11,798
um I grew a Kim 991 S1 and uh a snitch

418
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,759
free sour d last year that both

419
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:18,960
exhibited the volatile chem strong

420
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:22,279
traits that you get on the nose but the

421
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,640
resin um after harvest and after sitting

422
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,000
in their jars they they morphed quite a

423
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,759
bit and that that um you know that Sour

424
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,960
Diesel that um used to smelling or that

425
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,440
that chem dog that I'm used to smelling

426
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,079
it it like you said it changes or my

427
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,038
perception of it has changed a little

428
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:42,000
bit um it's it's not it's not exactly

429
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:43,599
what I thought it was every you know now

430
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,599
that I've I've gotten a chance to to

431
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:49,678
throw it in the

432
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:51,279
garden yeah yeah it's uh I don't

433
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,840
everything everything makes a difference

434
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:57,798
you're Cur you're curing process

435
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,480
you're I mean yeah it's it it is a

436
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:02,319
finicky plant and those things are

437
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,120
volatile and and everything makes a

438
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,599
difference and also a lot of us were

439
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:09,479
probably growing at smaller scale 20

440
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:12,319
years ago or 15 years ago than we are

441
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,440
now or or vice versa and like all those

442
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,399
things just make a difference regardless

443
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,798
of whether you think they are or not

444
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,440
it's just every little thing is

445
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,839
different

446
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,960
now peaches you you and buck also have a

447
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:30,158
sour correct maybe not a bad segue for

448
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,079
for you yeah we did uh four of them

449
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,880
outside this year um just in 10 gallon

450
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,879
pots on the back of the Hill cuz all the

451
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,520
big pots were filled but uh she did

452
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,559
really good outside she was a heavy

453
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,960
feeder um definite heavy feeder I could

454
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:48,918
give her as much in her T gallon as the

455
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,279
45s were getting and uh it kept her

456
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,000
happy wow um so but she did good and

457
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,678
honestly it's it was it's one of my

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,839
favorite smokes right now um when it

459
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,280
finally got dried and cured

460
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,158
uh it tasted just like it used to taste

461
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,399
back in the day like I remember getting

462
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:09,200
it from up in the bay in like

463
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,679
2000 and uh it was one of the first weed

464
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,798
I ever tried that actually tasted good

465
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,320
like it it coated your mouth I never

466
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:19,918
forgot that weed and um to smoke it

467
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:23,918
again it it's it's there that's what it

468
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,520
is like the chps are there um and it was

469
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,080
it was a good plant I'm really happy

470
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,720
with it I'm planning on putting it back

471
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,918
out next year um a few more of them a

472
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,360
little

473
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:38,480
bigger um but I was happy with it it did

474
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:41,359
good and then um so it was one of my

475
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,038
favorites uh she went the sour went 11

476
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:47,839
weeks um all the way into

477
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:50,960
November um but luckily she was smaller

478
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:54,759
and no mold no nothing like she was a

479
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,360
champ they got rained on um and

480
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,759
everything and no mold she purpled up

481
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,439
really good was a beautiful fall

482
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,119
colors yeah she uh she was always mold

483
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,960
resistant at my place she could get

484
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:09,639
rained on quite a bit and hold up yep

485
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,960
she got ran on I want to say like three

486
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,080
or four times and then you know towards

487
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,960
the end letting her finish up she was

488
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:20,879
getting the de in the mornings and I was

489
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,400
a little worried but nothing no powdery

490
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:29,200
mildew no btis just a real champ of a

491
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,798
plant yeah big flowers but

492
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,159
flowers definitely allow air

493
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:38,440
flow yeah and then I squashed some of

494
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,360
the flower uh just recently into flower

495
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,960
rosin and um I haven't got to smoke it

496
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,558
yet but man was it it was so turpy it

497
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,240
wouldn't come off the paper it was so

498
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,480
oily it was one of those types that you

499
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,000
know that just so gassy smelling and

500
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,079
stuff that it just that that rosin's not

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,798
going to set

502
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:01,839
up how was the yield on

503
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,839
it um I honestly I haven't waited yet to

504
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,918
see what it yielded I literally pressed

505
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:09,278
it on the last day and threw it in the

506
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:12,159
freezer and came home with it and it's

507
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:14,440
still in the freezer so it was it always

508
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,400
did really well for for yield and

509
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,159
quality on the bubble hash this was this

510
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,000
was before rosin was even a thing but uh

511
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,679
yeah it was always the first stuff we

512
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,440
washed and it was the main stuff we

513
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,400
wanted for bubble hash because it it it

514
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,759
just quantity and quality is always

515
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,440
topnotch on it oh see you should have

516
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:35,798
never told me that cuz now I'm going to

517
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,480
put more out on the hill next year

518
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:40,599
a as as long as you got the climate for

519
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,640
them to finish they they really do like

520
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:46,038
that post Halloween finish yeah as long

521
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,840
as you got that climate I say go for

522
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:52,519
it sometimes we do sometimes we don't

523
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,599
you know it just it all depends um this

524
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:58,240
year was a good year though it it rained

525
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,879
a little bit but nothing major um so it

526
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,640
wasn't too bad cuz we don't have a

527
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,559
greenhouse so everything's just out

528
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,360
there so it's got to stand up to what

529
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,278
Mother Nature brings to

530
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,798
it

531
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:13,159
cool other than the uh sour d what what

532
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:16,319
else in the garden did you grow last

533
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:19,600
year that really stood out to you uh the

534
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:22,079
Barbara Bud by uh House of the great

535
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:25,839
Gardener um I've been searching for

536
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:29,519
peach church now for like five years and

537
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:32,959
uh it's the first one that had Peach

538
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,679
chirps um several different fenos had it

539
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,519
in it but there was one that she had it

540
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:42,880
from start to finish and then um I just

541
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:46,200
made flow rosin with her and it tastes

542
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,320
like peaches huh like artificial or like

543
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,519
candy no like a peach cup you know like

544
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,038
the little Peach cups you used to get as

545
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:58,240
a kid right and it's like sweet peach

546
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:59,119
smelling wow it smells like that huh

547
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,440
that's interesting I've never

548
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,879
encountered that before it's the first

549
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,080
time I've ever smelled peach in a strain

550
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,159
like and then I I only had one feno I

551
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,879
kept because she smelled all the way

552
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,520
through the other ones kind of changed

553
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,640
but uh I saved the two that changed and

554
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:21,079
I did fresh Frozen with them and when I

555
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:24,880
washed them and squashed them that live

556
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:27,240
rosin when you Stir It Up it smells like

557
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
peaches wow and they weren't even the

558
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,159
feno

559
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,159
kept so yeah she's she's got those TPS

560
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:40,840
in there and she was another one she did

561
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:45,240
great in the rain no mold um now I had I

562
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:47,439
only had five feminized seeds that I had

563
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,159
put out and every one was a different

564
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,360
pheno and one of those fenos didn't grow

565
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:57,520
past 2 feet tall was a mad bush like she

566
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:59,759
reminded me of how Bubba used to grow um

567
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,639
or like the banana cush or LA

568
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:07,200
Confidential just not tall totally all

569
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,038
Leaf horrible to prune um that feno I

570
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,240
would never keep and then there was

571
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,480
another one that was a sativa feno that

572
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,640
got you know 9 ft tall had open buds

573
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,159
that one I washed um along with another

574
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,038
one that was similar to that one but my

575
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:25,278
keeper feno had the nice thick dense

576
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:29,038
buds it had good coverage Sandy tric

577
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:31,720
Combs and that peach smell so um I'm

578
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,240
going to do her again next year CU I was

579
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,399
so

580
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:40,000
impressed um and then I have to say my

581
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:42,239
one other standout on the hill that um I

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,159
wasn't too happy with the tur profiles

583
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,440
cuz I got a lot of Mandarin cookie

584
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,799
leaning ones was the peach

585
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:54,080
Crescendo um cuz she's got some Frost

586
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,879
like you go to trim her up and you're

587
00:25:54,079 --> 00:26:01,240
what an eighth in and you've already got

588
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,039
to clean your scissors yeah yeah so and

589
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,120
then a couple times I've smoked her in

590
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:08,679
the last few days and I've caught a

591
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,719
little hint of peach like a fresh peach

592
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,600
but then it kind of changes almost into

593
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,440
like a banana and then it kind of

594
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:17,439
changes from there so and there's some

595
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,759
potential in that one but those were

596
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,038
probably the ones I was the most

597
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:24,038
happiest

598
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,839
with yeah whenever I'm trimming and I'm

599
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:28,038
I like you said your scissors get gunked

600
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,439
up way too fast my mind always who I

601
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:31,119
wonder how this would wash you know I'm

602
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,798
always always thinking about the

603
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,918
concentrates on that strain

604
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,278
yep um

605
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,520
exactly something else I I wanted to

606
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,079
talk about before I uh before I go on a

607
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,798
couple other strains that I grew last

608
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:50,199
year um the papaya little Hill that you

609
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,679
grew did do you see any pink pistols uh

610
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,720
when you grew it

611
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:59,120
Outdoors no I didn't um I don't know if

612
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:02,880
the originala did that or not but uh

613
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:05,558
um this cross none of that know a lot of

614
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,159
the modern people are talking about the

615
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:11,200
pink pistols in it oh wow no I didn't I

616
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:14,120
I didn't see anything remotely close

617
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,080
most of the pink pistol stuff is either

618
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:20,678
camera OG lineage yeah or uh there there

619
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:24,558
is some other stuff my buddy down in

620
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:27,080
Hopland used to have uh some guava Kush

621
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,240
that he made that had some God Bud from

622
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,879
Hawaii in it and there were phenotypes

623
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,558
that would push out those hot pink

624
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,360
pistols but that's interesting yeah

625
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:38,759
that's that's that's about it as far as

626
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:41,918
I've seen from that okay yeah both the

627
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,599
chem 91 and the sweet 16 chem 91s pushed

628
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,080
Pink Pistols this

629
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:51,639
year they they stayed pretty true to

630
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:53,398
that yeah there was a Kim 91 or Kim D

631
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,120
not 91

632
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:59,798
sorry yeah it was sweet 16 to Kim D not

633
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:02,719
Kim 91 that sounds

634
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:05,278
interesting very chemically very salty

635
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,159
but also still like still mostly

636
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,679
overpowered by that fermenting wine

637
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,159
fermenting fruit

638
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:17,720
smell um something else I wanted to talk

639
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:21,080
about was the Appalachia crosses from

640
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:24,319
high and Lonesome um I got to try a

641
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,278
plethora of them between my garden and

642
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:30,200
my two my best friend and my brother's

643
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:32,200
Garden um I popped a bunch of Appalachia

644
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,120
stuff kept a kept three or four for

645
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,000
myself and gave them three or four each

646
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:39,798
to to grow out and what I was really

647
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,640
Blown Away with was the Appalachia old

648
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:47,200
Betsy um I mean it was like a dead

649
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,480
ringer for old piny

650
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,558
Afghanistan just cushy old gen genetics

651
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,759
you know bright green dense buds with

652
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:59,359
with fire red orange hairs it was it was

653
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,759
uh it was like being transported back to

654
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,240
the early 2000s when I was you know

655
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:07,158
first first messing around with buying

656
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,720
weed and and before I started growing in

657
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,360
like 2007 2008 and the before that I was

658
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,480
picking up stuff that reminded me of

659
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,199
that like uh it it was I was really

660
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,399
impressed with what the Appalachia did

661
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,720
Outdoors across all the Hybrids really

662
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:27,918
big really vigorous really healthy

663
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,919
plants and um that funky Orange orang

664
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,720
there's this mango Funk that

665
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,278
accommodates all of them and it was uh

666
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,839
it was most it shown through mostly in

667
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:40,960
the shore in the shoreline Appalachia

668
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,639
the shoreline Appalachia started off

669
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,159
smelling like um just orange and vanilla

670
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,880
or like those candied orange slices and

671
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,399
then after harvest and after it spent

672
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,840
some time in the jar it's just

673
00:29:53,398 --> 00:30:00,158
skunky volatile smells that are dominate

674
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,519
acrid acrid would be a great way to to

675
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,960
describe how uh how funky the skunk

676
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,640
smell is coming out of the shoreline

677
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,240
Appalachia and then um another one that

678
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,240
I was really impressed by in the

679
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:16,120
Appalachia line was the Appalachia to

680
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,440
the loomus headband it was um some of

681
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,839
the best lemon turps that I've had in

682
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,360
recent memories um not the strongest

683
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:26,639
lemon turps like lemon party still holds

684
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,278
the crown for me for lemon turps but it

685
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,679
it was just

686
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:35,359
a a really good blend of cushy Full

687
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,720
Assault um instant onset heavy

688
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,599
medication with a with a nice like lemon

689
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,038
drop flavor in it I was really impressed

690
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:46,000
with the Appalachia loomus headband um

691
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:48,839
my my brother got a chance to grow that

692
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,038
one and I didn't and I liked it so much

693
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,240
that I'm absolutely G to try it um I'm

694
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,480
probably going to try two or three plans

695
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,960
of it next year it was it was it was

696
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:03,679
really impressive to me

697
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,960
and then um what else did I grow last

698
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:10,679
year that I really like um yeah the the

699
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,759
atw hybrids um the Arcada train wreck

700
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:18,519
hybrids from pack some of the most

701
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:22,278
unique takes I've ever smelled on um Tor

702
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:25,278
pentalene like I got to grow a cat five

703
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:26,720
and a Mojo rizon my brother grew a cat

704
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,278
five and a Mojo rizon and then my best

705
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,519
friend grew Mojo 5 in a crosses people

706
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:35,440
know those are dosidos the category five

707
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:39,120
is dosidos slurricane to Artic Arcada

708
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:43,399
train wreck and then the Mojo rizon is

709
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:46,319
blue garlic to Arcada train wreck um and

710
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:49,119
the category fives were like mixed berry

711
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,200
on top of trolene um kind of like a

712
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:55,038
mixed berry Crunch and still dominated

713
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,200
by the by the tealing but hints of berry

714
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:01,558
mixed in there and then the Mojo RIS

715
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,960
were um super unique uh definitely

716
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:06,038
tentene but more of a menthol I called

717
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,360
it blueberry Menthol when I would rub

718
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:11,079
the the stock or the stems I'd get like

719
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:14,119
a blueberry Menthol turpentine but

720
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:17,240
there's also this background layer of

721
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:19,439
mushroom compost um I smelled it in the

722
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,519
blue garlics at the party when I first

723
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,320
smelled it I was like whoa It's like

724
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,759
composting mushroom and then as I grew

725
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:30,839
the Mojo rizons that blue G

726
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:33,319
mushroom Funk came through and it was it

727
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:35,879
was very prevalent across the all three

728
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:38,519
plants in three different Gardens do we

729
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,840
know what's in the blue garlic um I

730
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:45,759
believe the blue garlic

731
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:49,359
is um I'm not sure right off the top of

732
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,359
my head honestly I think

733
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:54,959
it's I feel like there's a

734
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,759
GMO I think it's GMO to the blue cookies

735
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,079
but I could be wrong I I think it's yeah

736
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,079
I think it's blue cookies to

737
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,000
GMO look it up really

738
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:12,638
quick um yeah Circle to yeah yeah look

739
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,600
it up when we get chatting about

740
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:17,839
something else um yeah so so the stuff

741
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,798
from pack from from goat farm I was I

742
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:25,158
really liked those atw hybrids it made

743
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:27,480
me want to do the blue dream atw knowing

744
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:30,440
the knowing what's there

745
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,440
potential oh yeah what are you I'm

746
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,880
already

747
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,798
seeing uh they're not far they're

748
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,960
probably about 20 days in um but okay

749
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:42,200
the balance of to pinolene and blueberry

750
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,079
is quite uh already quite apparent I

751
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,880
mean obviously it's going to change over

752
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,798
over the firing uh period but already I

753
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,200
can kind of see like the different

754
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:55,038
balances that each individual's you know

755
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,519
um showing me which is really cool I've

756
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,759
never I'll be honest this whole time you

757
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,679
know I know that the Syndicate crew

758
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,919
generally are big fans of tending but

759
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,159
this is maybe the first time I've

760
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,399
actually confirmed myself what

761
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,240
terpinolene actually is because it's so

762
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:10,679
obvious you know with these that I'm

763
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:14,118
like okay I know what I know what that

764
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:17,320
is I know what that is now cool right

765
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:21,000
right I bet those have a potential to be

766
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,800
huge yielders um yes train R crosses do

767
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,119
do great

768
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,240
um it just train wreck is good in itself

769
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:31,480
but it needs a boost from something else

770
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,559
usually a squat indicia but a blue dream

771
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,878
is also a commercial yielder um yeah

772
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,679
dude like you have potential for for

773
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,960
having really really good weight on

774
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,838
those the Vigor on these uh was alarming

775
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,000
to me as someone who grows in like these

776
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:49,320
basically micr spaces this has been

777
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,760
probably the most challenging um line

778
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,320
yeah Blue Dream is a is a real narrow

779
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,640
leaf and it's going to stretch and and

780
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:02,079
train wreck is like this weird mix of

781
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:05,000
you know equatorial genetics and indicia

782
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,359
genetics where it also has a stretch but

783
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,838
it has like a very odd Leaf shape so it

784
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,920
might look like an Inda or or pretend to

785
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:16,759
be one for a while and then it hits its

786
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:19,760
stride and and just start stretching and

787
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,119
and uh I can tell you that oh sorry you

788
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,400
go you finished oh I was just going to

789
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,440
say the the stems on train wreck will

790
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,639
stretch a lot and they won't break they

791
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,639
they're very

792
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:32,319
rubbery yeah they'll Bend they will bend

793
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,559
all the way over back onto the ground

794
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,640
and not break I'll say that I can

795
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,320
definitely uh at least you know

796
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:41,480
anecdotally corroborate what you're

797
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,838
saying like the the train wreck leaners

798
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,880
are giving me trouble because they want

799
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,440
to spay out you know they just want to

800
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,720
flop over and take over like all the

801
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,720
horizontal space and then the Blue Dream

802
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,919
leaners just want to go straight up so

803
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,559
having to do like very different

804
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,800
constraints for both of them that's

805
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:58,799
exactly what I would expect

806
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,599
yeah cool yeah those late season train

807
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,440
wreck plants tying them up and they're

808
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,559
just all floppy all over the place no

809
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,880
matter what the weight the weight on

810
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,880
those thin branches is insane for train

811
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,280
wreck all right that's where I think it

812
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,559
gets its name from is because it looks

813
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,960
like a train if you don't support it

814
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,318
properly it's just this this whole Maze

815
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,318
of branches just flopped over laying on

816
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:31,279
the

817
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:34,519
ground um I think that's where it gets

818
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,560
its name honestly and and and I I mean

819
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:39,239
I've seen it in my own garden of of

820
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,078
plants just completely falling over and

821
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,799
pulling bamboo staks out of the ground

822
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,240
falling like towards the South where the

823
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,920
weight is and I just take those bamboo

824
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:49,000
staks pull them back and the whole plant

825
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,000
just pops right back up and not a single

826
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,440
broken Branch it's just it's just what

827
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,519
it what it does right um I

828
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,200
I wanted to ask little Hill about um his

829
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:06,719
Phoenix um stuff and how how he how how

830
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:09,919
he thought it went oh I know that's like

831
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:12,799
T1000 adjacent but you know right uh

832
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,039
Phoenix is a T1000 to to back to

833
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,000
Triangle so it's a triangle back cross I

834
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:22,159
selected this pheno four years ago I

835
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,559
think or five five seasons ago um 2019

836
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,679
and just I've kind of had it on the back

837
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,279
burner just growing it a little bit here

838
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:31,279
in there but I really rolled out with it

839
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,040
this year and I I knew the quality was

840
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,119
there I I I knew I like the smoke I knew

841
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:40,279
it was going to do okay um what actually

842
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:43,200
added bonus it yielded really really

843
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,960
well in the outdoor beds so so that was

844
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,358
cool and I'm

845
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,599
definitely gonna roll out with it again

846
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:53,519
next year and grow more of it

847
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:57,079
um I passed it to a few other people

848
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:59,358
including uh csi's brother in Trinity

849
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:02,200
and uh it's been good enough to stick in

850
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,559
their Gardens and and and and take up

851
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,639
you know some real estate in their

852
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:10,960
Gardens as well um so I've I've been

853
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:12,679
I've been absolutely ha so happy with it

854
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,838
as far as just like the quality of the

855
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:16,000
smoke and the flavor I I wanted to get

856
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:18,679
as well as the

857
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,880
potency and then on the the test results

858
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,559
I've gotten back have both been I think

859
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,920
I've gotten three test results back and

860
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,480
they've all been through the roof uh

861
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,960
high turpine levels over one of them was

862
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,000
over 3%

863
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,559
Tarpin which is really good

864
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,599
um uh and then just the added bonus was

865
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,519
the yield I didn't expect it to do quite

866
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,559
as well as it did but but it did and and

867
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:44,639
so that's you know I'm a commercial

868
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,920
cultivator but like I selected this

869
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,838
based off of vigor not yield it it it

870
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,240
had all the properties I wanted as far

871
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:58,199
as flavor and structure and

872
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:01,239
then if you vigor was a big part of that

873
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:04,719
um if you grow a big enough population I

874
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:07,159
grew 111 females out to pick this one

875
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,559
and it was unique out of all of them

876
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:12,879
sheesh if you you can really see a

877
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:15,078
difference in Vigor Vigor from seed um I

878
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,838
mean all seed has its Vigor for the you

879
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,760
know for the most part but there's these

880
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,239
sports that stand out that just you

881
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,280
can't hold them back from growing and

882
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:27,078
they outgrow their sisters and and this

883
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,599
was in that group of maybe the top 10 %

884
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,880
uh vigorous plants which was just also

885
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,119
again an added bonus to I'm selecting

886
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,519
for quality of flower for the most part

887
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,480
um and just to have it be in that top 10

888
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,639
Perc I think that's really what makes a

889
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,800
commercially viable cut blue dreams in

890
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,559
that same category where it just you

891
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,280
can't hold it back from growing it's G

892
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:54,318
to grow and that's that's that's part of

893
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,760
what makes it such a good commercial cut

894
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:58,358
um so just to have that added bonus like

895
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,800
it's going to be a quarter in my out

896
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:04,400
outdoor Garden next year um and I'll

897
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,760
probably grow it in some green houses as

898
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,000
well Phoenix is an awesome name for a

899
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,960
backat cross train like

900
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,599
that yeah yeah I called it because it it

901
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,199
survived was the only mother I kept

902
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,280
through the fire in 2020 and I kind of

903
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,598
just like all right it needed a name we

904
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,160
were calling it back to the triangle for

905
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,480
a while and I really like that name but

906
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,159
but I I don't know I just I just felt

907
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,760
like Phoenix was was what we should

908
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,358
could the whole the cross should be

909
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,760
called back to the triangle I don't

910
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:38,679
think I don't think Caleb ever named the

911
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,960
back cross but um it's a good it's just

912
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:43,838
a good it's a good name I gotta giggle

913
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,480
out of it yeah like back to the triangle

914
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,599
too that one's got to get used yeah all

915
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,400
right everyone that's the end of the

916
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,920
episode um again I'd like to thank uh CH

917
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,680

918

cross to sour dub as well as the 98

923
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,880
Super Silver Haze cut that people call

924
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,519
the cup winning Shanti cut which we

925
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,358
don't really know but we know it's a

926
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,800
great cut of super silver haze cross to

927
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:14,759
sour dub F that's going to be on the

928
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,039
right site um we're going to be doing

929
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,079
another drop of Blue Dream soon with

930
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,920
goat farm brand new releases we haven't

931
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,519
done yet with it or shown um they've

932
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,480
been done we just haven't shown them and

933
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:29,838
they've been run um also keep your ear

934
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,199
and eyes pilled for the TGA work

935
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:35,239
because as odd as it is to hear me

936
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:38,000
announcing any new TGA stuff it's

937
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,919
happening um space dude met a lot of

938
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,800
other things that he probably should

939
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,519
have met back in the day in in my

940
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,560
opinion and other people's opinions so

941
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:50,440
I'm really stoked about that I'm

942
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:53,679
I'm it's it's conflicting because it's

943
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:57,760
TGA you know but I uh we love Miss Jill

944
00:41:53,679 --> 00:42:00,480
always love Miss Jill and uh man I'm

945
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,200
really stoked about it I I believe s had

946
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,559
a legacy with some cool stuff um he made

947
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:08,039
his name doing cool stuff and regardless

948
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:10,239
of how our relationship was I think that

949
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,480
no matter what I can put my biases aside

950
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:15,639
with that to make sure that Legacy

951
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,079
survives with extra cool [ __ ] still

952
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:19,480
around you know with something he

953
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,280
brought to the table really well in

954
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,960
selecting the space dud um with that

955
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,079
said we have seeds that Girt by seeds in

956
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,318
Australia we have right Co Europe we

957
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:34,440
have lifted seeds in the US who can also

958
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:38,159
take Card directly and soon maybe maybe

959
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,760
maybe South America and Brazil um we'll

960
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,039
see how it pans out I think it's going

961
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,440
well so if it does I'll definitely keep

962
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:45,558
you guys posted in the future and yeah

963
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,480
with that I'll probably see you guys in

964
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:51,880
a few weeks um until then stay nice to

965
