00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,599
good afternoon

3
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,079
good afternoon

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840
hi hope they that woke you up our next

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,480
speaker sam moronto is the state

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,359
director for mufon illinois

7
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,198
early this year the ufological community

8
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,878
if that's even a word was rocked by a

9
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,280
headline about a ufo sighting over

10
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,280
chicago the o'hare airport

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
what made this so interesting was the

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,719
amount of traffic that this one

13
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,200
particular story

14
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,879
attracted from the internet i believe

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,118
that the stats were well over a million

16
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,118
hits and

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
in the history of chicagotribune.com no

18
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,280
story had ever pulled that traffic so if

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,079
anybody tells you there's no interest in

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,239
ufos i think that's proof enough

21
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,319
san maranto has is an investigative

22
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,078
researcher who goes out into the field

23
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,839
researches not only the o'hare sighting

24
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,319
but many sightings even outside of

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
illinois so let me welcome to the stage

26
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,438
mr sam moronto and for the first time

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,560
i've ever said maestro hit it and move

28
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,559
on maestro hit it

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,280
snappy little ditty isn't that

30
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,598
well i figure if michael shermer could

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,919
bring his toys to the larry king show i

32
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,639
could bring a little music to the mufon

33
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,639
symposium

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,360

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
o'hare incident

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
i'm going to cover a little bit of that

38
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,759
and then i'm going to be covering a

39
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,959
little about

40
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,919
an incident in my backyard which is the

41
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,239
area

42
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,000
known as tinley park

43
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,599
and we had a series of sightings out

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,680
there mass sightings back in 2004

45
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,719

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,080
correlation with other sightings in and

47
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:02,400

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,080
remarkable footage

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,598

airport as well as ed o'hare who also

172
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,959
either cited that

173
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,719
same object or saw to go to the sauna

174
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,638
after that just to clear the rest of

175
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
those pours out okay so what did it look

176
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,478
like again to the folks who saw it it

177
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,240
was a saucer-like yeah it was hovering

178
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,279
with this

179
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,598
yeah right over directly over gate c-17

180
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,478
that was stationary in the sky

181
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,439
uh dark gray metallic uh you know like i

182
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,279
say saucer shaped no lights

183
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,800
and it was there for some minutes and

184
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,799
then when it

185
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,720
disappeared it just streaked through the

186
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,680
clouds with such energy

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
that it broke a big a blue hole in the

188
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,560
overcast

189
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,038
and the hole remained there for several

190
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,879
minutes until the wind uh drifted and

191
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,279
pushed the clouds back together we'll

192
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
cover a little information on that

193
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,598
yeah the blue was the sky but but

194
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,759
otherwise the entire skyline was uh was

195
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,279
cloudy totally overcast huh oh i forgot

196
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,199
that spot over here it's nothing an

197
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,719
airplane just doesn't react like that it

198
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,320
slices through

199
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,320
and it doesn't disturb the atmosphere

200
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,599
there you go

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,919
at this point for his next interview

202
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,360
yeah and going back on

203
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,838
a radio station a couple of radio

204
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,399

then headline news has a show i'm doing

206
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480
it

207
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
three o'clock

208
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
okay

209
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,880
ooh i'll have to watch if i'm

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,360
yeah i'll be opposite by them um

211
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,278
okay australia what other international

212
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,800
oh my god i mean i mean all over europe

213
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,958
oh my gosh i'm you know hearing from

214
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,329
even ireland they say you know we heard

215
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:19,838
about what's happening at o'hara

216
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:21,120
[Laughter]

217
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,959
i mean just

218
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
as well as serious you know uh

219
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,719
researchers at major u.s universities

220
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,640
who've attempted to do their own

221
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,120
investigations and when they go to the

222
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,639
government to try to get information uh

223
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,399
they get stolen

224
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,838
so there really is this universal

225
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,159
feeling that the government knows a lot

226
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,160
more than it's willing to tell man okay

227
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,799
what i find interesting is would they

228
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,560
say that otherwise if it wasn't so

229
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,519
candidly you know

230
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,599
okay done here i don't know

231
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,120
i'm just going to say

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
what i found interesting is john

233
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,278
hilkovich i am so this is i see how he

234
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,279
presents this right here i was the first

235
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,679
one to get to talk about it that's right

236
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,679
friday

237
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,880
okay the ufo hair story the chicago

238
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,200
tribune exclusively broke on new year's

239
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,439
day is garnering attention

240
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,879
around the world joining us now to talk

241
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
about it once again is trivial

242
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,480
transportation writer john hilkovich who

243
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,000
broke the story and john the response

244
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,920
has been well

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
out of this world hasn't it yes it has

246
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,078
been an astronomical gym

247
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,120
every major country it seems people have

248
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,120
written in

249
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
both those who claim they've spotted

250
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,560
ufos during their life as well as

251
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,278
serious researchers i mean just the last

252
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,119
two days this is my email and these are

253
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,320
the serious emails you know the ones

254
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,240
from kooks who said they were brought

255
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,040
aboard alien spacecraft i put in a

256
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,600
circular file so it's just a story that

257
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,958
has legs and people are fascinated by

258
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,560
the thought and i think there's some

259
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,479
belief that there are advanced life

260
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,639
forms that are visiting us here on a

261
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,000
regular basis you've been contacted now

262
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,838
in the last few days by several

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,839
countries but that also includes serious

264
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,200
university researchers here in the u.s

265
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
you know i've got to tell you too i got

266
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,959
a call from my dad in california monday

267
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,039
night and he's like what is up with the

268
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,639
o'hare ufos or i'm like where did you

269
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,879
see that where did you read that well

270
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,039
it's on fox network's crawl

271
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,919
at the bottom it's just amazing how much

272
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,240
this is garnering yeah it really is and

273
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,559
worldwide attention as you say

274
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
and uh from people who have observed

275
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,838
made observations themselves including

276
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,000
on november 7th the date of this

277
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,680
incident uh

278
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,519
additional people both at o'hare and

279
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,679
outside the airport who have either seen

280
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,320
this gray disc shaped metallic object

281
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,479
themselves or they saw that huge hole in

282
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
the sky that the object created when it

283
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,920
vanished let's go over that one more

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,278
time what did people see when it all of

285
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,439
a sudden vanished

286
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,120
right through the clouds over the united

287
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,360
terminal and then how's the faa been

288
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,360
reacting uh the past few days too any

289
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,800
any new ground on that okay well the

290
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,879
object was hovering in a stationary

291
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,199
position about 1500 feet above the

292
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,679
united terminal for some minutes and

293
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,920
then when it left it just burst through

294
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,399
this thick cloud layer

295
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:03,199
creating a large open space of a blue

296
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,278
sky on an otherwise overcast day

297
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
it took some minutes for that opening to

298
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,600
close up when the clouds drifted back

299
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,879
together and it's just extremely unusual

300
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,399
according to the witnesses i mean

301
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,600
airplanes just don't react like this

302
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,039
they slice through clouds and they

303
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,519
really don't disturb the atmosphere that

304
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,000
much except for the wing tips and such

305
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
uh the faa is still

306
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,480
you know pinning this to a uh some kind

307
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,479
of weather phenomenon that some lights

308
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,959
from the airport or the over casca

309
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,079
somehow got together and created this

310
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,518
image but uh weather experts uh

311
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,958
astronomy experts others that i've

312
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,839
talked to said that that's uh that's

313
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,879
bunk uh that's the explanation just

314
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,560
doesn't wash united on the other hand

315
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,078
after first denying that they got any

316
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,319
reports from employees about this

317
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,399
sighting is now saying yes indeed their

318
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,240
employees did approach them immediately

319
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
because of concerns about safety and to

320
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,159
reiterate john the witnesses who

321
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,159
originally came to you are all seasoned

322
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,078
professional credible professionals like

323
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,759
pilots who saw this they're pilots

324
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,838
they're senior managers they're

325
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,919
mechanics and others so uh you know

326
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
they're they're very truthful about what

327
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,679
they're saying and we're trying to

328
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
locate photographs if they do exist of

329
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,120
this incident john we know you have

330
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
plenty of other interviews to do today

331
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,399
with other countries so we'll let you go

332
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,120
and we'll keep our eyes to the sky

333
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,120
thanks thank you jim

334
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
and the conversation still rolls as it

335
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,759
rolls to black

336
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,079
it's isn't it amazing what what really

requests for interviews because uh yeah

344
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,799

00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:50,240
cool thanks ron thanks jim

346
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,240
can we run the second part please

347
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,599
come to chicago's this is from cnn over

348
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,519
the world but do they come from other

349
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,120
worlds you don't believe this was

350
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,519
possibly your imagination it was

351
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,759
definitely not my imagination joe was a

352
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
mechanic for united airlines while

353
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,159
taxing a jumbo jet to the hangar he and

354
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,320
another mechanic looked out the window

355
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,919
in the general direction and noticed an

356
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,000
object up in the sky

357
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,479
dark gray object sitting above the

358
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,240
terminal complex joe which is not his

359
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,000
real name is one of several airport

360
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
workers some of whom have talked to the

361
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,958
chicago tribune who say they saw a

362
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,278
saucer-shaped ufo hovering just beneath

363
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,958
the clouds at the airport he's the first

364
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,958
to go on camera to talk about it since

365
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,879
this happened several weeks ago he wants

366
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,958
to remain anonymous but you're sure it

367
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,720
was some kind of object that normally

368
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,239
would not be above o'hare airport i've

369
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,639
been at o'hare for

370
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,320
quite some time and let's just say that

371
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,159
i've never seen an object in my time

372
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,320
there that looked like this

373
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,240
and i'll tell you definitely it was not

374
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,480
an airplane as we know it but it could

375
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,720
be an airplane as another world knows it

376
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
possibly we brought in one of chicago's

377
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,519
top sketch artists followed the contours

378
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,199
of of the object to listen to joe and

379
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,159
draw a picture of what he says he saw

380
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,000
more like an oval dark gray oval because

381
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,838
no photos have surfaced and joe doesn't

382
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,559
know of any now it didn't say good year

383
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,000
on it did it no good year no that's a

384
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,239
really good drawing is that what it

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,919
looks like very much so yeah other

386
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,919
witnesses told an organization called

387
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,320
now there is the object

388
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,039
that most people

389
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,240
who have seen this footage say

390
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:32,639
was the object this was a cell

391
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
picture

392
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,159
i don't know how much darker they can

393
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,559
get that it's up in let me point it out

394
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,519
it's right up there

395
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,518
see it

396
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,078
that's the object

397
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,959
and this was actually sent anonymously

398
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,758
to above top secret which is a very good

399
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,679
website and blog

400
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,800
the thread on this was i don't know how

401
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:59,439
many pages and in fact my witness that

402
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,000
came forward that is also you'll see

403
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,240
included in the narcap report and

404
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,480
narcrap was actually field this case

405
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,600
the reason why of course is richard

406
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,399
haynes

407
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,040
uh

408
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,600
is known for dealing with aviation

409
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,559
personnel so this was really important

410
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,240
uh that this was feel to him i was able

411
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,799
to do some work interview this

412
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,720
individual and strangely enough my

413
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,479
format has changed because i was

414
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
actually supposed to come here today

415
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,039
with two sets of footage that never

416
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,639
materialized up until the last moment i

417
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:37,679
was guaranteed i was going to have them

418
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,399
i'd like to progress now if we can to

419
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,278
a

420
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,039
um

421
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,278
interview that we did with fox in and

422
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,439
about this time that i think took on an

423
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,838
entirely different tone from these and

424
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,759
i'd like your interpretation of it or

425
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,000
your opinion thereafter can we move to

426
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,480
the next segment on this

427
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,879
is it possible

428
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,759
i'm crossing my fingers

429
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,759
i'm getting nowheres okay

430
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,480
there is another segment of fox peace

431
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,000
but

432
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,078
evidently we have some technical

433
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,359
difficulties is this right somebody tap

434
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,000
me in the back of that or send me a

435
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,838
pigeon with a letter

436
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,199
okay

437
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:14,639
anyways we'll

438
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,120
give you some information about the

439
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,480
o'hare case and where it finally end up

440
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,198
the final report which is 155 pages you

441
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,759
can actually see that and download it

442
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,759
at narcap.org

443
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,480
narcap.org and when you go there go to

444
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,200
the left hand side of the page and it'll

445
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
say the ohio report it was posted august

446
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,319
27th

447
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,720
in there you'll see the compiled

448
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,960
information from foia

449
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
requests which actually were fulfilled

450
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,919
but not they did not come in

451
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,038
simultaneously but trinkled in

452
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,440
trickled in a little bit at a time

453
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:56,640
interesting in that request was also

454
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,038
some footage that some radar footage

455
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,640
about 14 minutes that are missing and

456
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,240
would have been pretty

457
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,759
important but didn't happen and here we

458
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,240
go back to

459
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,240
this piece

460
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:12,319
to the west off i-88 this man snapped a

461
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,559
photo of it as he drove to his home in

462
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,720
westmont it kind of looked like it took

463
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,279
a building and knocked it over and it

464
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,319
was flying around

465
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:25,918
and to the south in tinley park i got it

466
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,918
on tape i got it it has perplexed tj

467
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,320
japcon and so i turned around and i

468
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,960
looked up and i'm like no way

469
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,960
no way for nearly six years they're back

470
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,240
but never fear inside this orland park

471
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,918
apartment san maranto he's on the case

472
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
did you see that right here there all

473
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,799
right

474
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,160
illinois director i look like a troll

475
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,240
they put this thing right next to my

476
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,759
head it doesn't take much i can't fit my

477
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,279
hand the day before they're showing the

478
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,359
holes in my hand like i'm some sort of

479
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,759
drug addict or something

480
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,399
especially busy ever since a ufo was

481
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,400
spotted over o'hare last november he's

482
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,640
been interviewing reluctant witnesses

483
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,200
who won't go public with their accounts

484
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,160
these are not crackpots still he admits

485
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,240
most if not all of the photos of the ufo

486
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,640
that have since surfaced on the internet

487
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,880
probably aren't legitimate absolutely

488
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,400
insane but back to this i've gone

489
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
through this probably about 10 times

490
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,798
hours of home video from various south

491
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
suburbanites there's airplanes along

492
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,759
with them look at that all shooting the

493
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:31,759
same hovering light configuration as tj

494
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:34,000
japcon back in 2001. perfect 2004 he

495
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,480
goofed us when you're like wow what is

496
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,679
this thing ken and sherry ganaka saw it

497
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,558
in

498
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,559
not a single sound no noise at all is it

499
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,918
above top secret reverse engineered

500
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,279
technology

501
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
possibly

502
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,879
that's a hoax it's a hoax being

503
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,880
perpetrated on people astronomer mark

504
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,360
hammergren believes these lights are

505
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,080
nothing more than flares suspended below

506
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,159
weather blends nobody wants to be to say

507
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,639
to people that there's no santa claus

508
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,600
emergent also has bad news for linda von

509
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,520
henke and her family waiting for it to

510
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,000
either come on down or

511
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,599
or take me on up or whatever it wants to

512
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,599
do i'm

513
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,399
it's breathtaking this is the planet

514
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:17,119
venus then there's this guy they told me

515
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,000
i'm nuts asking to remain anonymous even

516
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,479
though he too insists what he saw was a

517
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,400
ufo do you any know any big giant square

518
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,919
rectangular looking blimps that move

519
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,759
like with the speed of a fighter plane

520
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,120
humans make extraordinarily poor

521
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,079
witnesses

522
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,239
they misperceive to hear this

523
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,918
but some people like chicago and mike

524
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,640
ernst refuse to back down here is this

525
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,600
this craft this this ufo his sighting

526
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,759
was at o'hare as well six years ago when

527
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,399
he was working the graveyard shift

528
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,879
cleaning airplanes it was just like a

529
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,440
metallic silver

530
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,679
it's about 80 to 100 feet long

531
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,200
70 feet off the ground you had these

532
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,120
real bright lights

533
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,798
coming from within it it was so close

534
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,319
that i could have grabbed the rock

535
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,639
and i could have hit the darn thing and

536
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,038
all of a sudden it just accelerated gone

537
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,360
it went there's cameras everywhere

538
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,640
the faa has to have pictures i'm not

539
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,240
making it up

540
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,880
there has not been

541
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,640
one piece of physical evidence

542
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,840
that has passed the scientific test

543
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,038
but they still believe i saw what i saw

544
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,199
period if you can't control it kill it

545
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,158
or conceal it

546
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,558
okay entirely you have to deny it in the

547
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,960
end does it really matter whether or not

548
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,918
these ufo sightings can be explained

549
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,240
away

550
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,480
after all wouldn't that take away all

551
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,159
the mystery the intrigue

552
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,159
and the fun of it

553
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,760
mark saxonmeyer

554
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,760
fox news

555
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,200
chicago

556
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,599
i wish that would have happened earlier

557
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
actually

558
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,119
well that was an interesting piece he's

559
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,879
led the piece with this lady obviously

560
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,798
looking at venus and everybody in this

561
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,440
room knew that yeah i don't know who

562
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,359
this person was never talked to her uh

563
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,919
second person i talked to actually saw

564
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,879
an advertising banner that's usually

565
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,840
seen and just downtown chicago along the

566
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
way

567
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,839
stop the video dvd looks like he's

568
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,839
getting eaten by something

569
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,158
i don't know what happened there that

570
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,199
was actually the the full

571
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,039
interview

572
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,159
um of uh

573
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:41,519
by mark saxomer from fox

574
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,840
of the witnesses those two witnesses but

575
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,679
what happened was um the piece was

576
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,240
supposed to play out differently as i

577
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,720
was told we planned for this three about

578
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,120
uh three or four weeks in advance we

579
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,360
spent a couple weeks getting everybody

580
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,239
lined up and not all the witnesses

581
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,079
showed up for the shoot the tone of that

582
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,640
shoot for fox was supposed to be very

583
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,839
serious it was not supposed to be

584
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,159
like this

585
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,359
the one individual you've seen

586
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,919
that

587
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,798
was talking about the o'hare incident of

588
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:16,159
of uh 2001 in april

589
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,639
was very convincing i met his family i

590
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,960
believe this gentleman to be very

591
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,400
earnest and funny thing is his last name

592
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,679
is ernst

593
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,240
and uh a hell of a guy too and he knows

594
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,559
he remembers this entire sighting very

595
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,919
vividly because as he says it was

596
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,319
up close and personally could have

597
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,240
thrown a rock at it maybe 60 feet a week

598
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,558
away there were four other people with

599
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
them but that wasn't everybody that

600
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,319
witnessed it he knew there were other

601
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,960
people and other hangars looking at it

602
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,038
and just didn't talk to him afterwards

603
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
so sightings around o'hare are really

604
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,359
not something

605
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,120
unique or new i believe our first

606
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,278
sighting in o'hare was in the 50s and it

607
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,119
was part of blue book that at least

608
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,200
recorded

609
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,719
the other thing about this sighting at

610
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,278
o'hare and i'm trying to cover a lot of

611
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,798
material mind you now this condensed

612
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,558
version is 155 pages long if you get a

613
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,158
chance please read it

614
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,038
and i'm going to give you the bottom

615
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,120
lines and everything

616
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,200
first of all we're looking at

617
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:20,158
is something truly original truly

618
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,519
unusual truly anomalous

619
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,440
secondly

620
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,639
many people seen it and it was

621
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,519
photographed it was photographed

622
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,919
and

623
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,079
some photographs i believe that did come

624
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,159
forward at least one of them may very

625
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,319
well be a legitimate photograph but

626
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,799
since we don't have anybody tied to it

627
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,960
coming forward we don't accept that as

628
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:44,000
evidence as you know that we at mufon

629
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,640
take a very rigid stance on what is

630
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,278
evidence and same thing at narcap

631
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,200
but one individual one witness that we

632
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,440
spoke to or i spoke to

633
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,278
i think she gave some very good insight

634
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,240
and if you don't mind listen to some

635
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,200
audio

636
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,839
uh from my interview with this person

637
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,640
i think it's very interesting can we

638
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,639
start the audio please

639
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:16,259
[Applause]

640
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,720
you know adjusting our arms and looking

641
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,599
at it through that

642
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,600
and uh

643
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,480
it's really

644
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,200
i think you knew when you were looking

645
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,240
at it even with the naked eye that you

646
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,360
knew it was something that was kind of

647
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,038
oval

648
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,719
just shaped

649
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:53,038
not as hard-edged as the stereotypical

650
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,038
tips

651
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,038
it seemed to have a spotlight

652
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,239
[Music]

653
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,640
what she's saying is we're looking at an

654
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,640
object with softer edges not quite the

655
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,679
same as the hard edge ufo that we're

656
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,278
usually depicted and everything spinning

657
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,240
counterclockwise

658
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,240
and

659
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
the other thing about it she mentions

660
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
earlier in the interview it had some

661
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,240
unique qualities to its of

662
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,880
its reflectivity

663
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,440
that made her consider other

664
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,559
types of components other than metal

665
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,120
even possibly some type of ceramic which

666
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,879
was very interesting this lady has a

667
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,759
background in

668
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,159
um

669
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:47,200
journalism she was reporter she was a tv

670
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,720
anchor person in the uh washington area

671
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,240
she has a

672
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,440
an interest in the military and military

673
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,839
aviation

674
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,759
and she has a background in it because

675
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,119
she is a military as referred to as a

676
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,679
military brat

677
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,918
her father was a

678
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,640
retired or is a retired

679
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,278
commander of a navy air wing

680
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,200
and she knows what flies how it flies

681
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,278
and what should be up there and not be

682
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,278
up there and she's also seen some highly

683
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,720
sophisticated stealth

684
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:21,119
technology she was absolutely certain

685
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,120
that what she saw that day

686
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,199
was not of this world maybe a little bit

687
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,199
more of that foot of that audio please

688
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,480
maybe that's what was causing that fuzzy

689
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,720
quality so the fuzziness would be like a

690
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,599
distortion around the edge

691
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,960
well

692
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,719
there was a distortion in the immediate

693
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,880
sky area

694
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,558
very close up to it but a visible

695
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,480
distortion

696
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,558
which i can see when i looked at it

697
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,360
through the reading class

698
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,398
um when you came upon it

699
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,119
uh

700
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,839
and you pulled over any idea like from

701
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,158
the time you actually saw it now you've

702
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,000
seen the whole event though

703
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,200
you know i must have because really it

704
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,960
was probably 13 or 14 minutes altogether

705
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,480
see now this is a long sighting this

706
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,319
wasn't something and and at that point

707
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,679
are you moving about where you're able

708
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:18,240
to get different perspectives or keep

709
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,278
from the road well when i first got from

710
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,319
the road

711
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,200
um

712
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:25,599
then we did move off um to get over to

713
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,480
the international terminal area and pull

714
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,639
over so i did get to see it

715
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,399
basically from two different places

716
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,399
which would have put it up

717
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:37,278
in the area of

718
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,319
the runways that are to the farthest

719
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,159
south

720
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:45,519
okay so here um there's the longest

721
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,080
runway that had to run from southwest to

722
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,759
slightly northeast

723
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,079
and it would put it kind of down in the

724
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,038
neighborhood of not quite

725
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,359
uh

726
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,480
not quite the end of that maybe up the

727
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:01,599
concourse is a little from that so that

728
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,679
area of gate seats uh concourse seat

729
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,599
which is that does

730
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,360
it totally make sense that's pretty good

731
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,439
right there we'll stop that

732
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,359
and that's pretty much uh enough audio

733
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,759
right now people are falling asleep so

734
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,439
what we'll do is i'm going to show you

735
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,640
some footage to keep you really awake

736
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,159
how's that

737
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,720
now we're going to talk about the tinley

738
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,640
park sightings obviously what came down

739
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,798
with the o'hare sighting is

740
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,440
everything conclusive and definitive so

741
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,278
far is at narcap and that's all i can do

742
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,440
is direct you because there's so much

743
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,119
material there

744
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,519
you'd really have to read it i have the

745
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,479
books in front of me but i cannot see a

746
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,639
thing

747
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,319
so i can't read the details

748
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,919
what i'd like to do instead show you

749
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,879
some footage from tinley park that i

750
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,640
think you'll find rather impressive

751
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,760
but before we show the tinley park

752
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,278
footage i'm going to show you some

753
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,558
footage from arizona

754
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:54,558
and this i'm going to give you some

755
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,079
insight august

756
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,440
the month of august in 2004 started with

757
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,278
a bang i could tell you that a lot of

758
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,679
things happened in 2004 as you can

759
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,159
remember august was the month of those

760
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,559
major hurricanes do you remember that

761
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,640
our first of the series of a five

762
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:16,879
category came on shore the 13th

763
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:21,120
of august well on the 19th of august we

764
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,679
had a craft or an object hovering over

765
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,319
minneapolis saint paul for six hours in

766
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,720
a 30 knot wind does everybody remember

767
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,158
that one or did you ever hear about that

768
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,558
it's sad up there did you remember

769
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,559
hearing about it in the news

770
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,879
of course not right even down in papua

771
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,839
new guinea and you didn't hear it there

772
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
okay

773
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:40,720
so

774
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,720
the problem was it wasn't really covered

775
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,038
very well narcap

776
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,038
uh i mean not in our cap but a new fork

777
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,558
uh received a lot of reports there was

778
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:53,599
footage of this

779
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:55,759
and there was also event that night in

780
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,719
let's say north west

781
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,319
or yeah northwest uh arizona and i'd

782
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,880
like to show you the object that was

783
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,639
seen there in a 30 mile an hour wind can

784
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,760
we show that which would be rob's

785
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,759
footage

786
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,759
and this is from arizona research group

787
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,278
1a

788
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,000
okay where's that pigeon

789
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,200
this is now see if i was on the radio

790
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,320
this is what's known as radio hell

791
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,798
okay

792
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,798
there we go

793
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,240
now

794
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:35,119
the vantage point this individual was

795
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,038
looking at this thing in the air in a 30

796
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,079
mile an hour when

797
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:42,558
he described it as being

798
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,319
not aerodynamic by any stretch of the

799
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,240
imagination

800
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,158
pay attention now to these illuminations

801
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,079
around the side and i refer to them as

802
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,159
illuminations not lights for the purpose

803
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:55,278
of illuminating

804
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,799
but illuminations the result of energy

805
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,640
and you see this one just go on well

806
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,918
it's all around it

807
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,759
it's very un-aerodynamic

808
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,240
and he first described it as being a

809
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,919
huge battleship in the sky

810
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,159
what you're looking at here

811
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,399
uh received ufo

812
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,200
footage of the year or photograph of the

813
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,278
year from jerry pippen's site

814
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,159
and knowing the individual for four

815
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,079
years

816
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,519
i can assure you this is a genuine

817
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,599
photograph

818
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,319
and it is something

819
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:29,839
out of this world or at least

820
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,839
an earthly technology

821
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,720
how do you like that

822
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:46,319
[Applause]

823
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,079
the research coming from this area has

824
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,278
got to be one of the some of the best

825
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:53,038
scientific actual scientific research

826
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,640
this and a few other events that

827
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,879
happened to this individual really

828
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,480
propelled him to look into things

829
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,919
that really

830
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,200
really made him

831
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,240
let's say question his reality

832
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,919
and

833
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,319
when you look at stuff like this and i

834
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,799
don't know if anybody out here i'm sure

835
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,439
there has quite a few who've had a ufo

836
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,679
sighting once you have one it's hard to

837
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,640
go back to just

838
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,798
your normal realm you know

839
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,840
things change

840
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,038
well for this man things really changed

841
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,119
and

842
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,398
also in tinley park

843
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,239
the next set of footage i'm going to

844
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,558
show you

845
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,120
i think things really changed

846
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:37,119
south side of chicago we have all these

847
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:40,319
border towns

848
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,759
and we kill it we kill that footage

849
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,038
there's actually quite a bit of footage

850
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,038
but i don't have permission to show a

851
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:45,919
lot of things i had permission to show

852
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,000
that

853
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,240
you kill that footage if you don't mind

854
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,079
stop that footage please

855
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,278
thank you um

856
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,798
tinley park

857
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,359
anybody know the area of any chance

858
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,359
tinley park illinois there we go

859
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,079
and it's a very populated area to give

860
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,479
you some idea it is a good demographic

861
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,639
it's a good cross-section of people

862
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,719
and it's highly populated

863
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,720
as you know it's south of chicago and

864
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,439
which is just basically an extension of

865
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:19,279
population it is also the most

866
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,838
illuminated area south of the loop it is

867
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,679
really an illuminated area

868
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,838
also in that area there's a very strange

869
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,398
subdivision that looks like a cyclotron

870
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,918
even as high as 36 miles up in the air

871
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,679
and yes i've looked at it through google

872
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:36,319
36 miles up in the air there's also a

873
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,398
auditorium a music center out there that

874
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,440
looks like a huge monolith it's really

875
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,878
bizarre the way it looks from space now

876
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,960
under the assumption that what you're

877
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,199
about to see is of an extraterrestrial

878
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,519
origin and i have no clue i didn't check

879
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,000
anybody's license and pull them out of

880
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,320
this thing i didn't even you know no

881
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,440
vehicle id i didn't see anything but

882
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,400
either way

883
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,440
the technology is definitely unearthly

884
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,320
and if we can run tj's footage

885
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,960
and tj's been lucky enough to actually

886
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,760
see this twice we had mass sightings out

887
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,159
there in tinley park and three events

888
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,240
this event took place two days after

889
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,639
that other object you saw

890
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:21,519
in phoenix that was the 19th this is the

891
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,519
21st could kick the audio up on this

892
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,240
that's him breathing and the crickets in

893
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,239
the background

894
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,320
they were having a party outside 40

895
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,320
people

896
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,200
ozzy osbourne just got done with a

897
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,759
concert people were heading off on i-80

898
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,919
about two miles away from there

899
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,320
and the air and water show was earlier

900
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,400
that day

901
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,720
and i think my friend here gets i got it

902
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,240
he gets a little excited huh

903
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,239
i got it i got it on tape

904
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,079
now what you're looking at here

905
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,119
i'm going to have you speed that up

906
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,358
please to get an idea of

907
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,680
what we're looking at

908
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,119
when i seen this the first time

909
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,759
i wanted to put it in

910
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,280
faster motion to get an idea if there's

911
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,680
if there's any

912
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,760
uh pattern to this or if they stay in

913
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,480
any pattern possibly being attached to

914
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,480
something and that's what we basically

915
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,639
came up with

916
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,960
this from what you will see in the next

917
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,440
sequence of the other sighting which was

918
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,838
the october 31st sighting

919
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,079
if we could forward to that

920
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,159
which will show up on them on the screen

921
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,839
as being 8

922
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,000
50 something

923
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,000
you will see a plane so the next set of

924
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
footage you will see here we go here's a

925
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,639
plane going in front of you two

926
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,800
batteries i got 20 minutes left in

927
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,199
battery

928
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,440
the object's about a mile or more

929
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,439
further away from this this gentleman

930
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,039
a plane cuts in front of it watch and

931
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,039
see this

932
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,920
there you go

933
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,039
october 31st 2004.

934
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,240
what is it

935
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,679
he had some kind of light no it's not no

936
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,000
no no no

937
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,559
that's them right yeah that's the

938
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,400
same red cherry lights as we had before

939
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,838
what they see is red red is the

940
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,920
wavelength that you would see because

941
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,679
it's the longest wavelength but actually

942
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,838
if you were very close to it you would

943
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:52,239
see a composite of the full

944
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:55,279
spectrum of the of our light range

945
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,279
now where's that plane

946
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,320
we back up i think we missed the plane

947
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,320
going through there

948
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,199
yep there it was

949
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,799
for a fourth one to come yeah this is

950
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:21,039
the end of the 21st of august uh

951
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,359
and actually another craft actually

952
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,199
shows up afterwards in each occasion we

953
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,199
need to go a little bit ahead now it's

954
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,199
starting to fade the plane's in the air

955
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,559
planes in the air

956
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,480
i don't know

957
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,599
i'm tired i'm running out of breath

958
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,599
i'm zooming a little bit more

959
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,039
they're back again

960
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,760
there's airplanes there's airplanes

961
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,920
along with them look at that

962
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,520
stop that for a second right there

963
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,559
that object is at from from the from the

964
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:53,440
airplane more than half a mile away

965
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:56,719
compare the illuminations now you heard

966
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,280
that astronomers say that what this was

967
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,559
was flares on a balloon

968
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,680
a flare

969
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,559
is a rating loom of about 60. the

970
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:09,279
illuminations on those crafts on on the

971
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:12,960
on the airplanes are substantially more

972
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,280
than 60 okay they could be 300 or more

973
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,440
depending on which lights are blinking

974
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,440
now when you look back there this object

975
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,358
being a half a mile away and we're

976
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,119
looking at an airplane there when you

977
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,239
know the difference of size and

978
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,160
calculating the distance those

979
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:30,399
illuminations those illuminations are

980
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,078
about three times the size of that

981
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,240
airplane

982
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,680
okay now you get an idea how big this

983
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,199
object could be

984
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:41,039
the other thing is

985
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,399
these are at the end of a large v

986
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:43,279
or a

987
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,680
v

988
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,200
triangular isosceles type

989
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:48,480
craft

990
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,679
very large

991
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,159
on the

992
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:55,759
21st we actually have footage of objects

993
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,960
coming in and out of this

994
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,800
object

995
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,000
the object you're looking back you're

996
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,240
looking at in in the background is over

997
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,960
three thousand feet long i wanna know

998
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,559
where on earth we build things like this

999
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,000
okay

1000
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:11,920
you can run that a little bit more

1001
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,079
please look at that those airplanes with

1002
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,079
them

1003
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,479
yeah

1004
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,358
they're you've we don't know they're

1005
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,960
ufos

1006
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,119
they came back on august 21st now

1007
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,119
there's more

1008
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:30,400
because mortar is just now what happens

1009
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,920
is he thinks it cut between

1010
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,240
the two

1011
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,920
the two on the bottom therefore making

1012
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,399
the assumption that i was wrong that

1013
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,880
this is not one object he didn't know

1014
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,160
how far the two objects were away from

1015
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,880
each other this very event we have

1016
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:50,159
on videotape vhs

1017
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,838
that is on a 90 degree angle confirming

1018
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,159
my

1019
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:56,480
hypothesis myself on the back

1020
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,000
there we are now what's interesting when

1021
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
he gets close to some of these you can

1022
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,719
see some

1023
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,240
some of the colors that are

1024
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,719
really interesting

1025
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,838
no it's not okay no no no right in here

1026
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,598
right

1027
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,880
yeah that's them it's the same red

1028
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,880
cherry lights as we had before

1029
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,838
look at them turning like that

1030
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,520
oh my god

1031
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,000
there seems to be a pattern too when you

1032
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,559
analyze at 1 30th of a uh

1033
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,519
a second to see the patterns they also

1034
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,519
go on and off the two will illuminate

1035
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,920
and fade and one will get brighter and

1036
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,400
there seems to be a pattern also when

1037
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,358
you look very close at the craft itself

1038
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,680
there's arcing blue like um

1039
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,920
electrical arcing underneath it

1040
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:43,039
and i have a still photographs last

1041
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,240
thing we don't know ufos

1042
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,239
pretty interesting how do you like that

1043
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:53,039
[Applause]

1044
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,039
now we're going to show you some footage

1045
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,838
from phoenix that i think

1046
00:41:55,039 --> 00:42:00,159
is also truly remarkable

1047
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,480
again from arizona research our

1048
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,879
gentleman out there who has

1049
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,599
done some magnificent footage i think he

1050
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,440
has up to 60 hours of footage now

1051
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,599
uh of some things now this is what we

1052
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,920
are able to show hopefully sometime in

1053
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,039
the future we'll be able to show more

1054
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,039
uh this is rob's last one

1055
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,279
i believe

1056
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,920
and if we could see that i'm gonna tell

1057
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,040
you what it is this happened on

1058
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,318
uh

1059
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,838
9 11 of all days

1060
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:31,199
2005. the funny thing about it is you

1061
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,279
noted in phoenix like when we had the

1062
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,879
phoenix lights all of a sudden they're

1063
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,720
saying you know two hours afterwards and

1064
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,960
they dropped the uh the flares they're

1065
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,480
saying that prior event was actually the

1066
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,599
event well the funny thing about this

1067
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,599
they dropped flares in the same area

1068
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,838
where this

1069
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,640
very huge and unusual

1070
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:50,880
uh

1071
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:53,440
array of lights let's say and possible

1072
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,880
object was actually located at and the

1073
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,720
funny thing about it they did that a

1074
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,960
couple days afterwards and yet the news

1075
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,959
agencies picked it up as that being the

1076
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,880
event now mind you we had two hours

1077
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,880
before the phoenix late this was

1078
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,440
actually days later and yet they said

1079
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,880
this was the event amazing isn't it they

1080
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,720
did time travel in the media did you

1081
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,480
know that

1082
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,199
let's see if we could have that last

1083
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,679
piece that last uh

1084
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,838
there we go now please watch this

1085
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,519
now you see those three

1086
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:25,440
these three here pay no attention to

1087
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:26,559
that that's actually a result or a um

1088
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,559
unusual

1089
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,318
artifact that shows up on his camera i

1090
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,559
want you to know he went through nine

1091
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,880
cameras doing this research so if you

1092
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,440
want to be a field investigator around

1093
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,160
these types of anomalous events and

1094
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,358
phenomena you better be able to replace

1095
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,199
your equipment because they beat the

1096
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,039
heck out of it

1097
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,239
please pay attention down here you see

1098
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,480
this

1099
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:51,679
line

1100
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,358
and if you can speed it up please

1101
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,960
pay attention to this and we're looking

1102
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,519
towards south

1103
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,199
towards south mountain about 20 plus

1104
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:03,920
miles away in this direction would be

1105
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,799
sky harbor anybody here know the arizona

1106
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,200
area

1107
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,119
okay so you have an idea where we're at

1108
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,598
north by glendale up that way now see

1109
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,358
what's going on here you will see things

1110
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:18,000
shoot out and up along this

1111
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,799
object here this illumination these

1112
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,239
illuminated this luminated field

1113
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,519
now i made the assumption to him i

1114
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,719
brought the

1115
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,480
assumption to him let's make the

1116
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,598
assumption this was one

1117
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,159
huge object i says would you able to

1118
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,920
give me an estimation on its size

1119
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,318
knowing where it would be located and

1120
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,760
the estimation came back to

1121
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:41,759
eight miles long

1122
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:47,599
i find this to be well back that up

1123
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:48,838
please

1124
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,519
back that

1125
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,519
up i can't show this other footage

1126
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,519
is that rather impressive or not

1127
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,839
now you will see a plane there it is

1128
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,760
okay let's back it up and run that slow

1129
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,318
because the plane is coming and an

1130
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,400
airplane's coming in

1131
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,639
just a little bit back it up

1132
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,318
and you'll see an airplane to the right

1133
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,719
come in through here

1134
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:18,880
going to sky harbor and all i could say

1135
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,439
is can you imagine being the pilot

1136
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,440
saying this

1137
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,318
i'd take a week's vacation at a minimum

1138
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,559
we'll come across here

1139
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:36,880
now this was a 9 11 2005. the funny

1140
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,559
thing is 9 11 2005 we also had events in

1141
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,838
tinley park

1142
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,078
the tinley park sighting there was

1143
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,400
correlations with multiple events around

1144
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,240
the world the first sighting day we

1145
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,960
actually had sightings around the world

1146
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,559
as far as even the aegean sea on the the

1147
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,880
the very next morning we had sightings

1148
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,440
down in houston texas on channel 11 they

1149
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,838
actually showed some footage supposedly

1150
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,920
i was never able to get it uh the 24th

1151
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,400
or the 23rd depending on what time zone

1152
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,760
you live in in australia there was the

1153
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,680
very same craft as seen in

1154
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,280
tinley park the same illuminated field

1155
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:13,679
and isosceles layout of illuminations

1156
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,079
actually photographed in melbourne

1157
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,639
australia

1158
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,839
okay thank you very much with that did

1159
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:21,838
you how's that pretty good

1160
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:27,039
[Applause]

1161
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,960
time is getting close and i'd like to

1162
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,199
cover a few things i'd like to cover at

1163
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,119
this point if you don't mind

1164
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,039
communication communication you know

1165
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,960
regardless of how much technology and

1166
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,719
whatever we have today we could you know

1167
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,358
you could we got cell phones heck you

1168
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:44,159
could call somebody all anywheres around

1169

the world again papua new guinea

1170
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,078
and you could be out in the forest or

1171
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,280
whatever and you have a cell phone or a

1172
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,280
satellite phone you can still

1173
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,359
communicate cell phone probably not

1174
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,440
satellite phone yes right

1175
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:58,559
um communication is a funny thing though

1176
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,720
how we communicate is even funnier yet

1177
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,679
now for the past 60 years and we're

1178
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,679
celebrating 60 years of roswell correct

1179
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,519
we're also celebrating 60 years of

1180
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,519
modern ufology

1181
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,400
we've communicated to the scientific

1182
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:11,599
community

1183
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,639
through this period of time and

1184
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,200
basically

1185
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,480
presenting them with what we feel to be

1186
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,118
rather

1187
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,358
substantial bits of information

1188
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,838
quality evidence to some degree

1189
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,920
and if you talk to ted phillips

1190
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,599
very hard evidence

1191
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,358
unfortunately

1192
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,440
the community at large at least the

1193
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:35,119
scientific community at large hasn't

1194
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,960
been let's say dented as of yet

1195
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,960
though i think the general public is

1196
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,800
finally getting the idea that there's

1197
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,800
something more than this now you can

1198
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,200
look at all different types of polls and

1199
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,119
they vary between certain amounts

1200
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,519
and if you talk to a skeptic it's 40

1201
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,000
percent that think that something's here

1202
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,759
they like to use the term believe i

1203
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,280
would like to turn the term belief

1204
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,520
thrown in the garbage

1205
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,839
believe is actually a leap of faith it's

1206
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,119
to take something on faith without

1207
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:02,400
evidence

1208
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,400
anybody here

1209
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,000
walking through those corridors looking

1210
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,838
at the material and talking or listening

1211
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,800
to any of the speakers and seeing the

1212
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:10,000
data

1213
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,318
and footage

1214
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,838
or any witnesses if you could walk away

1215
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:18,159
and say that i can believe because again

1216
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,480
it's a leap of faith then i'd say you're

1217
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:22,000
not listening very well or reading very

1218
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,760
well

1219
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,719
you should know by now that something

1220
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,880
truly unusual is going on if we're being

1221
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:32,159
visited i would say yes

1222
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,318
by what from where i have no conclusion

1223
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,879
but i think we should leave all those

1224
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,960
options open at the very least we

1225
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,800
shouldn't make any quick decisions but

1226
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,039
in the same token we should allow

1227
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,280
ourselves to at least consider the

1228
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,960
possibilities and this is something we

1229
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,960
should really prod

1230
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,760
science with because it's to the point

1231
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,920
now

1232
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,000
that we really have to go beyond that so

1233
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,318
for the next 60 years like something

1234
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,838
else would be something else may take

1235
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:59,199
place at least we hope something else

1236
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,039
will take place

1237
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:03,039
one thing to do is to bypass science

1238
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,000
altogether let's just talk to one

1239
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,079
another

1240
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
isn't it funny we don't talk to another

1241
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,680
one another anymore we're not on

1242
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,280
at the meetings and we're not

1243
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,000
congregating at things like this that

1244
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,599
much let's do that the other thing is to

1245
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,838
make use of other ways and means to

1246
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,640
communicate one way is the abstract form

1247
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:23,679
intelligence is true intelligence is the

1248
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,838
use of abstract abilities

1249
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,440
use of the abstract art and science have

1250
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:29,358
more similarities

1251
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,039
than one can imagine and with that in

1252
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:34,639
mind i'd like to show you a very nice

1253
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,880
music video

1254
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,920
by seth john stevens is the music

1255
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,920
musician the artwork by jim davis who is

1256
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,920
art director on the east coast at one of

1257
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,920
universities and i when the first time i

1258
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,000
saw this he actually brought me to tears

1259
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,240
it has nothing to do

1260
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,318
with the actual event

1261
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,719
of a sighting in

1262
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:56,800
in illinois on january 5th

1263
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,199
but it made a good tile title and it

1264
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,280
strum the court of imagination for this

1265
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:05,199
gentleman these two artists on that note

1266
