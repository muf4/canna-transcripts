00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,059
welcome to breeder Syndicate where we

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,559
explore the history of a clandestine

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,439
scene Through The Eyes of the folks who

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,600
lived in I'm Matthew owner of Riot seeds

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,118
I'll occasionally be joined by my

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,199
co-host not soja breeder and grower from

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,879
Mendocino

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,880
welcome to the underground

[Music]

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,399
alright so tonight I was thinking about

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,859
maybe we could talk about

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,920
a breeding A to Z but in the form of

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,058
like maybe I'll give you

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,840
um

17
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:48,299
a set of traits and that I want out of

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,059
an end goal so just teaching people to

19
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,339
start using goals and reading right if

20
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,640
you traits for an end goal hypothetical

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,620
end goal and you build it with

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,359
in your in your hypothetical toolbox

23
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:03,179
what what have you and you talk about

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,239
the ways you would go about this project

25
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:08,640
and then Vice the verse you can give me

26
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,640
some surprise traits and then I'll do

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,280
that with a feminized version of

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,879
whatever you give me

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,978
um

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,199
you sound like you're underwater today I

31
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,478
don't know what the deal is is it is it

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,159
coming clear for everyone or just you I

33
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:24,840
don't know maybe I guess we could ask

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,479
who's [ __ ] on right now can you guys

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,960
hear him super clear as he muffled

36
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,859
how we sounding testing testing one two

37
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,719
three

38
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,280
I didn't use the cool microphone and

39
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,900
[ __ ] this round because I thought it was

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,739
just not doing anything different but

41
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,180
maybe that's why okay

42
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:44,699
well maybe it's just me so I'll suffer

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,900
you suffer through it I'll suffer

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,299
through it

45
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,700
okay so yeah so I'm gonna so basically

46
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,979
it's like one of the maybe I'll I'll

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,659
throw like uh my Spiel on it or whatever

48
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,179
but

49
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,920
um for a minute there uh probably the

50
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,979
last five to seven years especially

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,759
there was like this explosion of seed

52
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,759
making

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,680
right and you know we've talked amongst

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,419
about it's probably like maybe even to

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,099
the point where like ninety percent of

56
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,339
the current people selling seeds started

57
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,079
in that era yeah right and so in that

58
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,020
time like there was this big explosion

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,959
of monetary value and all that and so

60
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,200
the that that economics changed how

61
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,020
people bred yeah a lot not everyone but

62
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,839
certainly a lot of people right and like

63
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,159
what used to be like side projects

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,860
um you know that were that could take

65
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,780
some time or have goals ended up being

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,680
like mashing a lot of famous things

67
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,840
together

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,459
yeah not if there's anything wrong with

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,219
that right but it just changed the

70
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,739
dynamic of like you know a lot of

71
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,139
multi-stage breeding kind of went like

72
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,300
to the Wayside yeah I sure did it sure

73
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,518
did right and so what what we're talking

74
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,719
about this evening is sort of like you

75
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,340
know I mean I guess you could get lucky

76
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,019
and just knock it out of the Park One

77
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,180
Step but for the most part like it would

78
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,519
be a multi-stage process to get to where

79
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,800
you want yeah I mean over several years

80
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,500
over several several years it's really

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,300
hard to knock it out of the park

82
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,860
consistently all the time unless you're

83
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,080
doing certain kinds of Femme breeding of

84
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,140
known clone to known clone you know but

85
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,120
um yeah yeah you know and so you know I

86
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,378
one of the benefits of like what's

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,000
happening right now in the community

88
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,340
might be that like the people that do

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,500
decide to keep reading

90
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,700
um people are into like longer projects

91
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,400
yeah

92
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,598
you know and so it used to be there was

93
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,280
a minute there where people would be

94
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34,738
like well you can't get Skittles and you

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,800
can't get chem 91 but if I make a hybrid

96
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,319
maybe you'll buy that yeah right and so

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,719
rather than like Skittles has these

98
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,939
things that I want and so does chem 91

99
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,280
and is there a way I can blend these two

100
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,139
things and eventually end up with this

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,919
plant that has the best of both worlds

102
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:55,500
yeah right I mean that that's still like

103
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,059
if I can blend these two things I guess

104
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,318
that's still an end goal if you have an

105
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,199
end goal of what you think they might

106
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,878
end up at in the end but that's still

107
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,280
kind of like the process the beginning

108
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,439
process of making crosses is just like

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,000
hey plant a plant B I want the best of

110
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,500
both let's see what happens you know but

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,299
having an end goal where you're like I

112
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,840
want this plant to end up like this for

113
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,400
this environment for this this XYZ is is

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,819
super

115
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,918
uh detailed you know yeah well I mean it

116
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:25,620
depends on how similar you want them to

117
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:28,139
be like you might only care about like

118
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,000
for instance a couple of the traits yeah

119
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,160
that you're trying to combine and not

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,139
need it to be like this I obviously like

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,960
the more things you're trying to achieve

122
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,600
the more the more difficult it becomes

123
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,978
yeah but if you know a simple way to

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,540
think about it would be like what if I

125
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,279
want to combine the Terps from this

126
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,740
plant with the potency of this other one

127
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,439
yeah then you're only searching for two

128
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,120
things yeah right so it can be defined

129
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,180
by your goals too

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,439
yeah right in that in that regard I just

131
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,240
think about it so differently I don't

132
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,279
even think that like to me that I don't

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,500
consider that

134
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,119
it's goals but it's not what I'm

135
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,220
necessarily referring to when I say

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,340
Goals sure

137
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,220
because one one is I'm predict I want an

138
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:14,039
outcome desired outcome and I'm picking

139
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,080
many I'm picking from my library to make

140
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,939
that outcome happen and the other is

141
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,000
still I'm gonna hit these together and

142
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,439
try to get the best out of what results

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,180
based on what I know I'm not saying one

144
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,639
is more legitimate I'm just saying that

145
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,560
like they're you know it's like a little

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,840
bit different to try to create like a

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,100
line that has certain traits yeah and

148
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,959
what I'm going to ask you to do is going

149
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,199
to be the hard one that's going to be

150
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,060
the hard one the hard one you know and

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,100
then and then on top of that too like

152
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,560
you know it it's kind of interesting but

153
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,300
like if you have breeders

154
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,759
um Matt's one you know like that have

155
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,860
been at it for a long time and that keep

156
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,139
certain plants around quite a long time

157
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,900
right like our buddy Caleb or flight or

158
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,478
whoever right what they get to do is the

159
00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:00,299
more you breed you actually get to start

160
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,620
to see which traits of the plant that

161
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,139
you breed with

162
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,120
follow up in the kids yeah because

163
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,379
there's some really amazing cuts out

164
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,860
there

165
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:13,918
um that suck as breeders yes very nice

166
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,780
so like the the individual cut itself is

167
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,939
amazing it's great smoke and all that

168
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:20,159
but it's not a stable or a solid thing

169
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,779
yeah and then there's other things that

170
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,639
just seem to breed true for certain

171
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:25,799
characteristics almost no matter what

172
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,180
yeah there's a lot that are just [ __ ]

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,180
Growers that people normally wouldn't

174
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,519
keep but are are amazing breeders and

175
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,439
don't breed for the traits they visually

176
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,538
Express somebody just said yes

177
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,259
terpenolene is very hard to breed out

178
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,939
yeah uh once once it's in there uh boy

179
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,038
it's really difficult finding what you

180
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:47,279
want without it in there it really

181
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,360
dominates yeah it does if she throws her

182
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,519
weight around

183
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,379
you know and that's interesting too

184
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,439
because there's aspects where it's like

185
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,000
uh since I'm gonna do the hard one

186
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,860
um you know what used to be [ __ ] up

187
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,259
about breeding especially if it took

188
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,120
multi-stage is that you have to make

189
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,600
sure that you save seeds from every

190
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,939
stage yeah because you can totally [ __ ]

191
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,620
up a line and do something that you

192
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,360
didn't want to do and it's a real bummer

193
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,160
and if you don't have a way to go back

194
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,080
one generation and go in a different

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,620
direction then you're just stuck with

196
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,538
that mistake yeah definitely and and I

197
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,519
don't think most people when they think

198
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,318
about breeding realize that they would

199
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,459
ever have to go back a generation I

200
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,439
don't think that even comes into the

201
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,598
equation in there and there might I know

202
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,719
it didn't when I was young oh yeah I

203
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,159
mean you fix it

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,319
most of our friends wish they had

205
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,120
there's at least one project they did

206
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,680
that they really like that they feel

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,478
like they [ __ ] up a bit along the way

208
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,978
and they wish they could go back and

209
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:50,038
redo you know yeah so uh he feels like

210
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:53,219
DJ did that DJ's stuff is DJ stuff is

211
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,079
his own story in itself it's Unique

212
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,880
um but you know I mean there's an aspect

213
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,258
of like different people have worked his

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,598
stuff in different directions at

215
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,939
different times he's given it over to

216
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,379
seed companies and then gotten back seed

217
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,660
stock

218
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,519
um so it definitely is like what era you

219
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,479
got it from it could vary quite a bit

220
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,918
yeah I would say so yeah you know so you

221
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,500
know but yeah I mean there's there's an

222
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,198
aspect of like I think for like most

223
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,560
hobby breeders really having some kind

224
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,240
of goal is is probably good you know

225
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,740
because I tell people all the time like

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,660
the most important thing of what you're

227
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,620
doing is that like you're happy with it

228
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,479
yeah right in the end that's that's it

229
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,278
well yeah I mean we for a long for a

230
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,860
long time we bred we just tried to breed

231
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,599
weed that we like to smoke yeah um

232
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,339
because it was it was long enough ago

233
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,259
that like we just never really felt like

234
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,899
any kind of seed company was was even

235
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,838
realistic yeah I never thought ever

236
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:52,139
about getting a famous Seed Company ever

237
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,000
in the history of my company yeah I mean

238
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:56,580
when we were when we were breeding in

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,860
the in the 90s and early 2000s and stuff

240
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,720
like that like the people that started

241
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,240
seed companies back then literally still

242
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,980
went to Europe oh yeah yeah you had to

243
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,680
go there to to make it big pretty much

244
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,839
so it was like a massive life [ __ ] like

245
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,199
it was you know so a lot of us we just

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,420
bred we just bred for ourselves yeah you

247
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,680
know now it's cool with Instagram you

248
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,539
know and all these different various

249
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,399
platforms you can do some a lot of

250
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:23,039
people can do small breeding and then

251
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,839
offer it up and Reach people yeah and so

252
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,019
there's this commercialism aspect that

253
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,580
was like hard before so like before a

254
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,120
lot of times people were trying to just

255
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,920
please themselves and their buddies

256
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,560
and now it's more like please the public

257
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,000
which is fine and there there was a

258
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,219
certain era too where it wasn't even

259
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,440
just please the public it was a much

260
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,660
smaller crowd and it was pleased The

261
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,899
Forum crowd you know what I mean oh yeah

262
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:51,419
sure tiny era of well it may not be what

263
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,879
I like but it's what sells on the forums

264
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:56,458
and even that is is a vast difference

265
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,740
from what sells on Instagram now you

266
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,359
know so I think I remember those I

267
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,000
remember those arrows and what was hot

268
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,860
and like the pressure to breed with all

269
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,080
that work because it's just people want

270
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,240
it and I mean I you know we there's even

271
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,000
posts from Neville when he was when he

272
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,459
was posting in like 2009 or 10. that

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,159
even in the 80s and early 90s he would

274
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:19,559
get [ __ ] for everybody would be like oh

275
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,360
I want the purest Indica imaginable yeah

276
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,859
he'd release something that was like

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,480
that and then they would suffer and

278
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,639
yield and he would get endless bitching

279
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,278
yeah so there's always been a commercial

280
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,838
aspect of it you know and then you end

281
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,320
up having to like you end up having to

282
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,540
please people so so in some ways all my

283
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,879
friends anybody that breeds for

284
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,679
non-commercial purposes you just get to

285
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,000
do whatever the [ __ ] you want

286
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,578
well

287
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,480
in this case you're going to do what the

288
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:52,379
customer wants oh my God okay here we go

289
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,480
so this is a rather picky customer right

290
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,480
um it's something that obviously has to

291
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,100
work in the modern Market since this is

292
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,839
2022. they want something with eight

293
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,278
weeks flowering they don't want none of

294
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,279
that long flowering [ __ ] that you love

295
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,600
they want eight weeks flowering

296
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,179
um they want a little bit of purple

297
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,040
right a little bit of purple the most

298
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,278
important thing that they're missing in

299
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,439
their Arsenal is black licorice mixed

300
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,778
with gas they want they want some gassy

301
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,440
back end on it and black licorice and

302
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:25,078
like I said uh modern market and

303
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,279
they don't want any OG or cookies they

304
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:27,958
want unique

305
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,939
oh man

306
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,099
so where do we start

307
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,260
to please this customer we don't want

308
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,019
any OG or cookies so so right there

309
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,700
right that makes it every everybody just

310
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,879
heard like they want like six different

311
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,940
things yes in the same line so that

312
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,278
everything you add make potentially

313
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,200
makes it harder or longer of a search to

314
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,659
try to figure it out yeah or you have to

315
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,519
get luckier to find it quick or you have

316
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,679
to have a large library that you're very

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,480
familiar with you know that helps too

318
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,639
because obviously like if you know how

319
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,200
your plants breed that could narrow it

320
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,639
down a bunch that would be helpful like

321
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,940
for me but if you were just trying to

322
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,100
smash plants together to find that

323
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,440
aspect it would probably be pretty rough

324
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,360
yeah and so basically what they want is

325
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,220
something that's pretty funny they want

326
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,339
quick purple

327
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,700
they want good Terps

328
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:22,860
Frosty Frosty is [ __ ] because

329
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,019
[ __ ] oh my God it's a modern Market they

330
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,919
need something that washes they need

331
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,919
something that washes

332
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:34,139
um no OG either not just cookies no OG

333
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,659
no oh gee that's right you're in that

334
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,578
corner like burner is doing and they

335
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:40,620
want it to be feminized or regular no

336
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:42,539
right you're doing regular oh my God

337
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,220
you're gonna do the same for me in

338
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:48,419
Reverse with feminized and you can pick

339
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:51,120
the traits that is horrible yeah

340
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,838
he just said here you go he just [ __ ]

341
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,600
me

342
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,120
um so the hard part obviously is that

343
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,320
okay so just break it down right you

344
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,139
need something you need something Frosty

345
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,180
terpy fairly attractive

346
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,700
um uh you needed to come in relatively

347
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:12,179
quickly and

348
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,399
um uh the the hardest one out of all

349
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,919
that is probably like the black licorice

350
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,958
Terps uh because that's pretty specific

351
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,519
and [ __ ] rare

352
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,919
um and then the other part of it that

353
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,759
sucks you know is that it has to be a

354
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,759
regular seed line

355
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:32,039
so in that in that regard what you would

356
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,559
have to do is you would either it can be

357
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,000
several it can be a multi-step

358
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,619
process well yeah I mean so that's what

359
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,940
I'm saying is like you would end up you

360
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,100
know one of your first steps probably

361
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,260
would be like you would have to figure

362
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,500
out what what kind of mail you wanted to

363
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,439
use and then you would cross it to you

364
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,480
know the uh one of the females that you

365
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,160
want to use and start there and then you

366
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,200
have a male female blend then because

367
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,759
now at first you need a pollen source

368
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,500
yes right that was one of the

369
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,419
attractiveness of [ __ ] uh everybody

370
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,339
like doing feminized is because they

371
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,899
could create their own pollen source and

372
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,339
they knew pretty much what traits were

373
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,839
going to probably pass because they

374
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,120
could smell their pollen source and look

375
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,440
at the bud yeah yeah so there's so

376
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,539
there's basically there's a way too

377
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,700
where it's like you know once you once

378
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,500
you and that's where all like the BX or

379
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,839
BC is people talking about like that's

380
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,360
where it started yeah is people needed a

381
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,060
pollen donor to start working on their

382
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,800
line idea yeah and then they could start

383
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,299
playing with it once they had pollen

384
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:32,099
they could make pollen every generation

385
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:34,799
yeah is really what it boils down to so

386
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,259
um realistically speaking uh probably

387
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,838
what I would end up doing

388
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,899
um is that uh

389
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,940
uh my buddy is throwing me off by

390
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,240
answering but what I would probably do

391
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,220
is I would cheat and I would uh my buddy

392
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,740
that just made me laugh uh him and I

393
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,139
made some a bunch of hybrids

394
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,320
um with some old Maple Leaf Indica seeds

395
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,000
from the early 2000s right and one of

396
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,639
the things that they did is we crossed

397
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,159
it to the Mendo P okay right so the

398
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,860
Mendo P has some color it's got crazy

399
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,500
Terps uh it doesn't wash that well or

400
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,300
anything like that but at the very least

401
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,740
um it's something old and basic that you

402
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:17,879
could start with yes yeah right so you

403
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,698
know one of the things you need to start

404
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,720
with is like an idea of how you're going

405
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:24,120
to start and how you're going to finish

406
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,839
yes right because whatever you finish

407
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,519
with the cross is 50 that yes you know

408
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,500
and so you're starting you're starting

409
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,039
and you're ending is 50 50 and in the

410
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,019
middle you get to play right so

411
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,338
um and it's not potent yeah no I mean

412
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,679
that's the thing is you're starting with

413
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,180
limitations

414
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,559
we don't need it I don't believe potency

415
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,059
was a part of it because in today's

416
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,799
market you can watch it and everything's

417
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:48,659
potent so potent's not a part of the

418
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,359
equation

419
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,219
so probably what I would do is I would

420
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,278
take that Maple Leaf Indica by Mendo

421
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,500
perps right and I would grow it out and

422
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,198
I would pick a male probably one that

423
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,759
leaned like in leaf structure and all

424
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,879
that and especially one that turned

425
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,399
colors um male flowers and stuff and I

426
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,419
would probably pick the most Mendo perp

427
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,958
leaning

428
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:15,240
uh male I possibly could yeah which

429
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,219
should be relatively easy because the

430
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,959
maple doesn't turn colors

431
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,660
and the leaf structure is way different

432
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,518
right and and Mendo P kicked certain

433
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:25,860
kinds of Terps doesn't it and Mendo P

434
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,679
kicks certain kinds of Terps right so

435
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,139
and well the other two is that it's like

436
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:33,000
a basic Indica that I started with and

437
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,639
then you cross it to something extremely

438
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,320
unique so hopefully you can pick out a

439
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,899
bunch of that unique

440
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,000
right in your mail which makes it a lot

441
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,559
easier than if it was like two similar

442
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,899
things yeah

443
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:49,138
um so take some pollen to that and I

444
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:52,159
would probably throw it on something

445
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,180
like the snow

446
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,500
interesting I wouldn't have thought of

447
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,359
that choice that's an experience yeah

448
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,159
well the reason is is that when I was

449
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,620
doing that project down south you know I

450
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,719
got to run a lot of Caleb's gear yeah um

451
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,818
and I probably ran half a dozen snow

452
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,959
hybrids yeah and the [ __ ] just

453
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:13,019
consistently kicks nice pretty colas

454
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:16,558
covered in Frost it shortens up the the

455
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:18,298
flower time and all that right so yeah

456
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,119
um you know the Mendo perps would bring

457
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:23,818
some color and some Terps the snow would

458
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,519
bring structure and and Crystal and like

459
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:28,619
a nice look yeah that's a good that's a

460
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,359
good choice I like it and I've seen it

461
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:32,879
and I've seen it work consistently on a

462
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,319
bunch of hybrids already yeah throw the

463
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,660
kind of traits through a bunch of

464
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,279
different crosses that I like so the

465
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,320
chance that it could do that and this

466
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:44,960
one is probably reasonably High

467
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:50,519
I think so so boom now I have a snow by

468
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,140
by Maple by purple yeah right so

469
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,759
you grow up that now it's more

470
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,320
complicated because you're looking for

471
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,179
traits

472
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,038
um so now probably what you're doing is

473
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,620
because you're it's not going to be as

474
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,179
easy to visually pick it out it would

475
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:05,819
probably get shitty and you'd probably

476
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:08,820
end up picking like three of the nicest

477
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,200
males you could find yeah and separately

478
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:14,399
pollinating

479
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,140
like the female of your choice yeah then

480
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,120
you grow them all out and you see which

481
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,440
which of those three hopefully passed

482
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,279
the most traits that you were looking

483
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,019
for

484
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,339
because there's an aspect with males

485
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:27,480
where you're like really not going to

486
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:32,220
know yeah you know so the wider mail

487
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,720
pool you use the uh the vet yeah but as

488
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,759
long as you can isolate it and see which

489
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,558
one goes to which yeah for the sake of

490
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,200
this argument not to get like crazy

491
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:43,139
esoteric and stupid I would just say

492
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:47,759
three triplets yeah you know and so now

493
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,440
I have a a snow Mendo P Maple okay right

494
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,900
and

495
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,558
um so I take a male of that or three

496
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,080
males of that right

497
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:00,240
and I hit it to I hit it each separately

498
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,178
to my modeling

499
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,240
because the Maui is bringing the Maui

500
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:08,038
well the Maui turns purple in the cold

501
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,620
it's super Frosty it's got chunks all

502
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:13,140
over it it's done in eight weeks so now

503
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:16,979
you've got a quick Maple a quick Mendo

504
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,259
pea a quick Maui you know the snow is

505
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,120
reasonably quick so all of a sudden you

506
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:22,859
start upping your chances that like a

507
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,239
Fino that you want is going to be in

508
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,819
that

509
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,120
that 50 to 60 day range of what you're

510
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,918
going for I guess right yeah you know

511
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,538
um and since the Maui turns a little

512
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,860
purple and the Mendo peas purple you

513
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:37,079
don't have a lot of purple in there but

514
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:39,479
you have some definitely and you can

515
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,119
start looking for it and the the snow

516
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,000
and the Maui end up having like you know

517
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,159
the structure and the frost yeah so then

518
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,880
I would hunt through that

519
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,038
but that's let's see so Maple onto the

520
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,520
maple onto the under the Mendo P that's

521
00:19:53,038 --> 00:20:00,359
one stage yeah right and then that onto

522
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:04,139
the snow that's two stages and then a a

523
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:07,918
a male out of that onto the Maui

524
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,679
you're already at three stages yeah

525
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,020
you know and where's your gas coming in

526
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,280
where's my gas coming in

527
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:19,440
boy you know the gas is going to be hard

528
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:22,319
I think because I think right there you

529
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,160
probably have your your

530
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:30,119
um wait you said gas and

531
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,460
yes gas and licorice gas and licorice

532
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,839
[ __ ] dude that's [ __ ] hard you're

533
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,759
gonna have to do this what if I just

534
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,079
pick one I'm just gonna pick one and

535
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,679
you're gonna have to deal with it yeah

536
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,678
yeah we could do one

537
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,240
now we have a like what is it like it's

538
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,240
like a four-way hybrid now it's like

539
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,200
Maple Maple started the pollen Maple

540
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,919
Mendo

541
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,840
and snow and Maui yeah

542
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,820
so if we wanted if we wanted now it's

543
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,319
gonna be 50 of the Cross right so we

544
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:01,259
have a bunch of early [ __ ] A bunch of

545
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,899
Frosty [ __ ] a couple purple things if I

546
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:06,058
really wanted to jack up the purple and

547
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,559
the licorice I only have one thing I

548
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:11,639
could do I could put it on the anise yes

549
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:12,960
but then that would be but then that

550
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,759
would be that would be [ __ ] because

551
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,279
then there were the the chance that you

552
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:22,798
would also get gas would be kind of hard

553
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:24,538
the anus the anus the Stars you know uh

554
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,519
because black licorice is really hard so

555
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:28,019
I don't think to be perfectly honest

556
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,879
anymore we're not going for gas anymore

557
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,579
we're just dropping that going for all

558
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,740
black licorice and modern people are

559
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:36,418
talking about Jaeger the the Anise is

560
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,798
actually extremely close to the Jaeger

561
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,960
the fish oh somebody who said the

562
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,099
fisherman who the [ __ ] just said the

563
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,140
fisherman

564
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:46,619
that's why what's that one what's that

565
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,940
one so my buddy uh my buddy and I we

566
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,158
used to grow a bunch of Anna's together

567
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,440
and he used to take it down to the bay

568
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,299
and give it to certain Crews right and

569
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,298
he was a professional tuner fisherman

570
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:58,558
yeah so they used to call they used to

571
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:01,440
call when we sold them that way they

572
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,538
used to call it the the fisherman

573
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,159
nice because my buddy's nickname was

574
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:08,279
actually tuna

575
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,340
tuna oh yeah is he in the movie Blow no

576
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:13,200
he was not in the movie below damn but

577
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:15,119
he but yeah I mean he's he's actually

578
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,220
like uh

579
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,259
um you know he's actually a big part of

580
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,740
that story really

581
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:24,298
um but yeah the uh the fisherman he uh

582
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,220
um that was probably back in 06 or

583
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:28,859
something like that so just so people

584
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,019
know right like I didn't even talk about

585
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:32,699
like you could get really lucky in what

586
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:35,400
I described and you could do it all in

587
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,200
in that many steps or you could grow

588
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,880
[ __ ] out and realize it's not at all

589
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,700
what you want and want to go back a step

590
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,559
yeah that's like a best case scenario

591
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,940
right there yeah that that definitely is

592
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:46,918
the best case scenario you know because

593
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,779
that that's assuming that like each

594
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,240
stage and then you could talk for a

595
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:52,440
little bit about like well how many

596
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,079
yeah

597
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,820
you know because every cross you have a

598
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,879
female is the certainty

599
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:02,099
yeah but does the male pass what you

600
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,080
want of the hybrid that's why I always

601
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,279
call it the shotgun method yeah you

602
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,720
called it the shotgun method and it's

603
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,879
right but like what they people used to

604
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,159
do in the old days is they would

605
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,720
they would cross like their three every

606
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,679
stage they would cross their three

607
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,839
favorite males yeah to the same female

608
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,280
and mark them different and then when

609
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:21,658
you grow them out

610
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,819
you look

611
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,080
yeah whatever one gave you the best

612
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:28,019
females

613
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:30,658
you picked males from that

614
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:32,759
that donation

615
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,440
you know what I'm saying yeah you know

616
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,179
because you were because that that was

617
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,798
the way that we tested back then if you

618
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,019
just did one nail you're just hoping

619
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:41,639
three isn't even all that great but it's

620
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,440
like let's be reasonable about people's

621
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,940
ability to actually do [ __ ] you know

622
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,519
yeah yeah

623
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,080
so you know and then you know it doesn't

624
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,519
I mean it doesn't have to be huge it

625
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,558
just depends on everybody's size it

626
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,200
depends on what you're trying to do you

627
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,700
know 50 or 100 seeds held back is

628
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,519
probably plenty for most people's

629
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,140
purposes yeah yeah you know to stick

630
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,460
with and then you'd probably and then

631
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,679
you put right there you'd probably have

632
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,360
a situation that would be there would be

633
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,100
plenty of purple plants there would be a

634
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:10,379
lot of Frosty and Visually attractive

635
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:12,199
plants the licorice would be in there

636
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,059
but it might be a little harder to find

637
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,759
you know and the gas we'd have to do one

638
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:20,460
more stage to something yeah to get

639
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,440
lucky and you know they asked what

640
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,419
you're naming it I think um he's gonna

641
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,659
probably call it the obvious the purple

642
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,400
anus

643
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:31,799
yeah

644
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,200
but that's how I mean in a sense like

645
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:37,019
you know when when we were planning the

646
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,360
super dog project it was like we we were

647
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,720
trying to get the the the looks and the

648
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,399
greenery oh and the smell of the skunk

649
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,880
combined with like the density and the

650
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,159
and the hour of the chem dog yeah you

651
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,260
know and so what Matt just gave me was

652
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,840
he just gave me like what was it five or

653
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,759
six requirements it was it was several

654
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:00,058
yeah yeah that makes it a real paint

655
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:02,759
purple black licorice gas eight weeks

656
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:05,339
flowering works in the modern market so

657
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:09,119
that's that's like five five that's five

658
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:10,558
yeah yeah it's half a dozen it's half a

659
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,658
dozen different things so that makes it

660
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,579
more difficult yes if you're only

661
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:17,580
looking to combine a couple of traits

662
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,839
from from one cross then you can do what

663
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:20,519
I'm gonna do with Matt and you can do

664
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:23,220
easy and you can cheat and you not don't

665
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,480
even need a male yeah you know but

666
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,880
that's how everybody used to start

667
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,740
things and then the traditional way

668
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,980
which is like what got done to maybe

669
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,500
like the c99 and other [ __ ] was that

670
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,380
people would now it's BC but back then

671
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,140
it was BX people would just repeatedly

672
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,100
cross males of a hybrid to the same

673
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,240
clone

674
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:47,759
yeah one two three four times basically

675
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,500
trying to get an inbred plant that was

676
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,558
as close to the mother clone as they

677
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,400
could yeah and because of that

678
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,440
that explanation of c99 and there and

679
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,600
and that long explanation of how it was

680
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,940
achieved and blah blah blah people have

681
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,459
consistently even myself I I was trying

682
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,380
to do bx3s for years and finding that

683
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,058
like I'm ending up with way more

684
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,640
[ __ ] than I started with why does

685
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:13,798
this look like an F2 as opposed to an uh

686
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,059
a bx3 this should be locking in stuff

687
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:20,639
not going way further away from it and

688
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:23,038
it it just doesn't it sometimes things

689
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,960
work great in theory in other plants

690
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,960
that don't necessarily apply as well in

691
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,100
cannabis because it's so variant and a

692
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,100
lot of people don't understand that

693
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:34,859
because of c99 the the misinfo given

694
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,418
with c99 yeah and I mean people just

695
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,158
think that like you know when you're

696
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,200
bxing it's like you'd probably need a

697
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,419
pretty big population and then there's a

698
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,240
reason why they call it inbreeding

699
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:47,460
depression yeah you know it really takes

700
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,620
big populations to avoid that and so

701
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,778
most people are doing hobby ship you

702
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:53,278
know and so what you just you know is is

703
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,900
like there's an aspect active like

704
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,058
trying to

705
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,820
um you know it's like I always think of

706
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:02,759
like what Neville's criteria was for his

707
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,558
nl5 hazes yeah right is he didn't want

708
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,140
anything that went over 16 weeks because

709
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,119
he thought that was way too [ __ ] long

710
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:12,120
and he wanted the potency

711
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,979
and he wanted nice enough Buds and

712
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,538
enough yield that it was worth going the

713
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,940
four months it took

714
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,558
and it had to grow and grow down a grow

715
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,058
Dan Rockwell on the ground well yeah I

716
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,038
mean they I mean that's all they used or

717
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,899
whatever so that was that was the aspect

718
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,599
but that's not he didn't really actually

719
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,460
breed for Terps he didn't breed no he

720
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,099
didn't add in a bunch of extra [ __ ] he

721
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,380
was going for weight potency and it

722
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:36,538
couldn't take 22 weeks you know like a

723
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,419
lot of the hazes were so you know he

724
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:41,339
only picked really three things yeah

725
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,080
you know

726
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,538
um and you know we just picked five or

727
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:48,298
six so it just goes to show that like

728
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:51,058
don't don't get discouraged you know try

729
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:53,519
to try to pick a reasonable a reasonable

730
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:55,500
blend and it's always easier if like if

731
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,418
Matt hadn't given me like the the

732
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,579
licorice thing was a super [ __ ] but

733
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,679
like if because it really limits there's

734
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,658
only a few things that have it I was

735
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,159
gonna go cinnamon but I decided to be

736
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,900
nice cinnamon I would have just thrown

737
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,720
my hands up and been like what the [ __ ]

738
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,220
you know [ __ ] yeah I mean because you

739
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,140
can get too specific but I mean

740
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,720
obviously there's there's scents like

741
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,240
gas or like terpenolene or like citrus

742
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,880
or whatever that occur commonly enough

743
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,819
in cannabis yeah that you'd have a bunch

744
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,340
of paths to pick where you wanted to get

745
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:29,158
that terp from yeah the terp that Matt

746
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:31,500
picked was hella limiting so you really

747
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,480
are like grasping at straws there's

748
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,859
there's some good ones I thought of that

749
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,900
you could have come up with that would

750
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:38,879
have covered all the bases too it was I

751
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,620
might have missed it you know it's hard

752
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,140
to think off the top of your head oh my

753
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,839
God a four or five stage project that

754
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,240
requires a real male because you know 20

755
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,439
years ago go all your buddy seeds it was

756
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,140
like everything you had in your

757
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,240
collection had regular mails in it yeah

758
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,440
and now most of my not all of it but

759
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,259
there's a good chunk of my [ __ ] that's

760
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,179
feminized yes so that's all I don't want

761
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:02,038
to say it's useless but it's like it for

762
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,380
this particular [ __ ] thing it's like

763
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:06,900
not very helpful yeah how many people

764
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,900
make red seeds right now yeah but you

765
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,419
could have done a femme female with a

766
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,120
male Thin Line female side I could have

767
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:17,100
yeah I mean there's probably and that's

768
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,839
the cool part right is that it's like

769
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,119
sometimes past your goal it's like what

770
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,278
you have access to yeah like the chem

771
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,500
dla Kush was the one I was thinking of

772
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,679
specifically for like maybe some some

773
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,140
Terps like uh uh gas and black licorice

774
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,820
but it's not necessarily purple you know

775
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,740
I actually missed that I didn't realize

776
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,200
that until a whole bunch of people

777
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,778
started popping that hybrid the La by D

778
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,179
yeah and and there's a bunch of people

779
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,278
that got gas and headband Aromas and all

780
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,019
that like I was expecting but I would

781
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,778
say there's been a few dozen people at

782
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:52,079
least that have talked about Anna's

783
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:54,960
Terps yeah they got the anus

784
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,898
us which was really interesting that you

785
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,220
know to to have that pop up

786
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:00,119
um you know even occasionally or

787
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,600
whatever

788
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,579
you know uh and you know I I you know I

789
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,379
went on a mission a while a little while

790
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:10,079
ago and I brought back all those seeds

791
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,020
right yeah and my buddy just never never

792
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,579
did the Femme so remember I was reading

793
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,500
them to you the other day yes and it's

794
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:19,019
like a hug because it's like what males

795
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,200
did he have when and what was he using

796
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:24,658
to blend with what you know but that's

797
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,700
something I've noticed with like um a

798
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:28,440
lot of Mendo breeding and a lot of like

799
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,019
the old school breeding

800
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,940
as opposed to like like with my mindset

801
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,819
it's like I want to use something very

802
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,860
very very basic like almost as close to

803
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:40,558
land race as I can or something very as

804
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:42,599
stable as possible um phenotypically

805
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,980
uh on the mail end so I'm not seeing a

806
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:45,839
lot of variation so I know where I'm

807
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,579
going whereas back in the day it looks

808
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,740
like they would do that single stage

809
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,538
crossed poly hybrid to poly hybrid to

810
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,700
polyhyper to polyhiber to polyhybrid

811
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:54,898
even back then like it was just how it

812
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,058
was done

813
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:59,579
it was yeah I mean there was a lot of

814
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:01,379
like what I call hillweed

815
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:03,480
um where people would when they sex

816
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,940
their plants their males would stay in

817
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,278
five or ten gallon pots off downwind in

818
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,600
the woods somewhere yeah right and then

819
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:11,700
when they wanted to make fresh seed

820
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,558
every couple of years or whatever they

821
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,778
would wait and they would go collect

822
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:17,099
pollen from all their saved males and

823
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:19,319
blend it together

824
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:21,000
right and then they'd walk up to their

825
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,759
patch and their two or three favorite

826
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,079
females that year they would take a

827
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,019
paintbrush or whatever and they would

828
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:29,278
brush the bottoms yeah of those plants

829
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,139
and mark them

830
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,359
so then they're taking a blend of like

831
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,240
you know whatever it is 6 or 12 or 15

832
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,918
boys yeah blending it together and then

833
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,899
adding it to like the three or four

834
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,600
sweetest females they saw from the line

835
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:45,000
yeah and you do that for 10 or 15 years

836
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:47,398
and then you have you have a bunch of

837
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,679
kind of unique Hillshire yeah you know

838
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,719
it was like it was relatively diverse

839
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,278
and they wouldn't do it every year most

840
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,500
people would just try to make fresh seed

841
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,119
stock every two or three Sometimes some

842
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,579
people were nerding out and doing it all

843
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,558
the time and some people like seeds was

844
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:03,178
like the only thing they knew about so

845
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:04,740
they just tried to freshen them up every

846
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,840
other season or so

847
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,278
you know it sounds like I'm talking down

848
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,199
on it but I actually like that's the

849
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,179
kind of stuff I hunt like if I hear

850
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,700
about someone having old Hill weed seeds

851
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,559
on something I'm like oh let me get out

852
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,240
of you know like I don't know why but

853
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,519
it's always the most appealing to me for

854
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,960
some reason it's also from an era where

855
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,720
there was a whole bunch of diversity

856
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,759
yeah and it was before like the same 45

857
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,640
clones get Blended together in

858
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:32,099
innumerable ways yeah so even just going

859
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,419
back that far opens up the gene pool in

860
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:34,918
a way

861
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:37,080
um I mean that's kind of why when I said

862
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,059
like you know what my buddy that I made

863
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,339
those seeds with or whatever

864
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:42,960
um he breeds seeds every year yeah you

865
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:45,538
know he's got stuff going back he's got

866
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,700
all kinds of odd stuff nobody I'm sure

867
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:48,960
people would love to hear it but he but

868
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,480
you know he breeds for him or whatever

869
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,340
and so he had these you know roughly 20

870
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,380
year old like you know probably from

871
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:57,720
like right around when Scentsy was

872
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,159
starting to go south yeah

873
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,140
um he has these maple seeds and they

874
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,600
were you know we crossed them to we

875
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:08,159
actually we actually uh grew a bunch of

876
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:10,139
them out um in uh five six years ago the

877
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,480
Mendo perps Maple uh there's some really

878
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:16,380
pretty pictures of them but they burned

879
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,079
damn they burned you know so they got

880
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,200
all the way to like October 9th and then

881
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,879
and then they went to [ __ ] you know yeah

882
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,038
um but that's kind of how you have to do

883
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,620
it it's like you have to like figure out

884
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,359
where you're gonna get it from and for

885
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,859
me it was a little easier because most

886
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:34,500
of the plants I've mentioned I've had

887
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:36,178
for a long time yeah so I know how they

888
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,099
work for someone that's just getting

889
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,320
started or whatever like that kind of

890
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,939
complicated thing not knowing how the

891
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,220
plants they have in their stable might

892
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,778
even breed yeah it could be there could

893
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,200
be more missteps

894
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:51,778
right uh I [ __ ] up a lot yeah you know

895
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,159
so don't don't uh there and there's and

896
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:55,019
I don't mean [ __ ] up I just mean like

897
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,000
you breed things you hope that these two

898
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,579
things come out of them and they don't

899
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,019
yeah so it's like you just have to try

900
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,460
it a different way you have to try a

901
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,778
different pairing you have to see if

902
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,000
they blend

903
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:08,338
you know and the more stages you have to

904
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,800
do that you know the you have to get you

905
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:15,239
have to get bigger you know yeah

906
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,039
um so anyway they uh

907
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,898
um but yeah that's that's roughly how

908
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,579
you would do something like that yeah

909
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:23,098
you know and then you want me to pick

910
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,480
something out for you yeah you go ahead

911
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,419
and fire off some traits I'll write it

912
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,099
down fire off some traits and I'll do it

913
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,658
from the Femme angle

914
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,659
from the Femme angle

915
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,838
no no you know you should use them

916
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:39,358
because because that's that's more

917
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:42,299
direct and it's easier for people to to

918
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,799
get right so I I wanted to like the main

919
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,839
reason I wanted to do it was I wanted to

920
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,119
illustrate to people how hard it truly

921
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:51,059
is to be able to say my seeds are going

922
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,559
to deliver XYZ and to be consistent with

923
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:54,358
what they say they're delivering there's

924
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,099
a lot more that goes into it than just

925
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,480
I'm gonna make a cross and these things

926
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,680
smell like this and that's the way the

927
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,079
seeds are going to come out it's just

928
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,639
not one way one way for people one way

929
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,699
for people to look at it is like how

930
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,920
genetics work is uh when you're Crossing

931
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:09,539
two things that are pretty simple or

932
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,760
especially things that are widely

933
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:13,199
Divergent from one another

934
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,040
um like say for instance Neville

935
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:19,858
Crossing nl5 and Haze uh or me Crossing

936
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,719
maple and Mendo P like you can see the

937
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:23,338
differences because there's certain

938
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,719
things to look for like if Neville's

939
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:26,578
growing some [ __ ] and it's super tall

940
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,980
and thin leafed and grows like a tree

941
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,619
it's hazy yeah it stays short and

942
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,599
wide-leaved and Afghan and stout and you

943
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,180
know all that it's probably nl5 Hicks

944
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,859
yeah you know and for Mike the hybrid I

945
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:40,259
was talking about you can look at purple

946
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:42,719
you know and and some of the traits that

947
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,579
are unique to Mendo Pete but

948
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,858
um if you cross things that are similar

949
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:49,500
to each other it can be a real pain in

950
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:51,960
the ass yeah to try to figure out which

951
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,039
one leans what way which one's breeding

952
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,800
which way

953
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,500
you know exactly you know and so there's

954
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,099
there's an aspect there where

955
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,380
um

956
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:04,859
I guess what I'm saying is that we have

957
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,680
entered the era where most things are

958
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:10,679
like a mass hodgepodge unless you go

959
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,598
older strains yeah it's a big mix of

960
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,239
genetics these days

961
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,859
right and so people start putting these

962
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:20,098
things together and you try to put like

963
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:23,519
a whatever you know like a freaking

964
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:25,859
um cush mitts you know by sour sour dub

965
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,599
two things with like huge histories what

966
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:30,000
could you get

967
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,338
you get a mass amount of [ __ ] right yeah

968
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,679
oh yes yes yes with those two especially

969
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:37,320
cush mitts

970
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:39,299
and sour dubs not too uncomplicated or

971
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,400
whatever right so

972
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,660
um so let's say let's let's say you were

973
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,460
gonna hunt something

974
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,039
right

975
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,260
um you know what are you gonna hunt so

976
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,679
what kind of traits do you want say

977
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,599
you're a customer and you're buying for

978
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,799
some big Corporation and they have these

979
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,420
certain wants you may you don't even

980
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,039
have to want them but someone wants

981
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,260
these and you're giving the direction on

982
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,940
what these traits are that they want

983
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,480
okay so they want something that's going

984
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:11,220
to be high yielding yield okay high THC

985
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,559
potency high THC potency yeah got it can

986
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:18,719
can go up to 10 weeks

987
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,460
up to 10 weeks up to 10 weeks yeah and

988
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,858
um

989
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:26,460
and let's see here give me three more

990
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:29,219
give you three more all right and then

991
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,619
so uh I don't want to say purple because

992
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:34,799
I just did that or whatever but

993
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:36,800
um let's just say that it has to have

994
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
um

995
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,319
it has to have citrus turps

996
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,820
laughs

997
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:49,739
brutal okay what and wash well

998
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,200
because they're because they want those

999
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,719
those High yielding Citrus extracts as

1000
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:56,879
well as that okay and so what do we got

1001
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,000
now we got it's got a yield well one

1002
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,519
more

1003
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,699
high THC up to 10 weeks Citrus wash as

1004
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,699
well

1005
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:09,960
hi GNC washes well that should pretty

1006
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,880
much cover it I'll give you those okay

1007
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,940
okay

1008
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,940
um

1009
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,960
I THC let's see

1010
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,338
I'm gonna give myself a little more

1011
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,139
complex I'm going to have I'm going to

1012
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:23,400
give it density because otherwise I

1013
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:25,559
would just say linen I just threw that

1014
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,700
in I mean as long as it yielded well

1015
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:31,679
yeah and and wash as well I don't think

1016
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:33,838
the [ __ ] I don't think the client is

1017
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,159
going to give a [ __ ] yeah I would like

1018
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,380
this this like

1019
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:41,460
it would be probably lemon G or like

1020
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,920
lemon G something like lemon tree

1021
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,260
um but if I were gonna make a femme line

1022
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,480
from scratch without the obvious [ __ ]

1023
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,800
and also leaving out like cookies and OG

1024
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,838
and stuff like that and I'm not I'm

1025
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,519
gonna remove lemon G because it's just

1026
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,838
too obvious

1027
00:38:53,519 --> 00:39:00,920
and with Citrus let's see here

1028
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,920
I'm gonna go

1029
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,539
I'm gonna go

1030
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,940
one second c99 grapefruit

1031
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,480
as the start and as the base oh man

1032
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:24,179
there you go on the male side because I

1033
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,800
know that this is the dominant

1034
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:27,779
um oh wait no I'm not doing me I'm doing

1035
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,940
female but so it's even easier yeah but

1036
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,180
it's also the dominant

1037
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,740
uh scent expression from c99 the seed

1038
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:37,500
lines going around so it's going to be

1039
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,838
more commonly occurring so when I'm

1040
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:43,199
choosing this female and it's showing

1041
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:45,480
that has a citrus grapefruit Terps it'll

1042
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,519
likely also breed for those knowing c99

1043
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,500
well like I do so we know we've got that

1044
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,599
covered but we also know c99 is like a

1045
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,699
seven to eight weeker so we've we can

1046
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,200
allow ourselves to bring up the THC with

1047
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:57,319
something a little more

1048
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,319
um

1049
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:03,719
a little more typically sativa end

1050
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:08,820
I would do

1051
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:11,578
I would do a a clone from Appalachia

1052
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,660
hi oh it's Appalachia Green Crack tray

1053
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,119
dog

1054
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:17,279
we've got the potency you got the wash

1055
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,920
well you got somebody actually just said

1056
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,740
Appalachia by senior second time yeah in

1057
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,099
the comments hilarious

1058
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:28,858
nailed it that's that's what I would do

1059
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:30,180
a good cut like a a green crack dominant

1060
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:33,420
cut with a little bit of gas of

1061
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:37,440
Appalachia and to a c99 grapefruit

1062
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:41,700
reversal and I would probably you know

1063
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,039
uh do it under middle halides on tables

1064
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:47,699
small plants

1065
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:49,739
um more plants uh in numbers for the

1066
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:51,899
reversal as opposed to bigger plants I'd

1067
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:54,479
want smaller and more

1068
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,480
and yeah that's how I do it

1069
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,000
that's how you do it no c99 doesn't wash

1070
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,760
super well but Green Crack washed pretty

1071
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,858
good and uh I believe Appalachia will

1072
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,119
too especially because the tray dog and

1073
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:08,699
I mean the other thing that you could do

1074
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,880
too is that if it ended up not washing

1075
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:15,299
well then you could have a c99

1076
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Appalachia hybrid that gave you some

1077
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,760
Citrus and some Bag appeal and some

1078
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,740
weight you know and and was going to

1079
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,380
come in within the time and he could go

1080
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:27,118
another step let's say he failed yes

1081
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,880
right let's say that failed let's say

1082
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,780
that got you high yielding plants

1083
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:36,180
right that had some citrus

1084
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:39,359
um but it didn't wash very well yes but

1085
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:41,219
you got high potency high yield and you

1086
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:42,980
had Citrus yes

1087
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:45,059
but you're short

1088
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,500
they're trying to they're trying to run

1089
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:47,940
it they're trying to they're trying to

1090
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,800
make ice water they're doing all this

1091
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,179
different stuff BHO and it's just coming

1092
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,460
out at a percentage it's not making

1093
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:54,598
their extraction happy yeah so now you

1094
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,519
need another step

1095
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,920
I need one more step for resin

1096
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,420
production I'm going to cheat and go for

1097
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,180
the white

1098
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,838
the white you're gonna go for the white

1099
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:09,299
the classic boost resin production uh

1100
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:11,519
the Terps aren't that great but I've

1101
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,980
seen it combine well with stuff that is

1102
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,019
really dominant like c99

1103
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,119
so I'd probably add the white in there

1104
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:20,699
because it was also it also has that

1105
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:24,240
that huge bag appeal and and it does

1106
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:27,239
have good THC do you think the c99

1107
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:29,699
Citrus is strong enough that it would

1108
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:32,098
carry through in a lot of those hybrids

1109
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:33,719
still and still be dominant I do I think

1110
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,460
you can't wash it out I think it's kind

1111
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,539
of like deep chunk one of those so you

1112
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,699
think it would be it would be one of

1113
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:41,279
those things where like the the sheer

1114
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:44,399
blandness of the white yep wouldn't

1115
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,900
dominate yep

1116
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:54,440
so then we'd have a a

1117
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:58,858
c99 by uh by Appalachia by the White

1118
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,179
Appalachia uh c99 White yeah that's the

1119
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:01,500
way I do it so reverse the white because

1120
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:02,519
I also know the white reverse as well

1121
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,900
that was the other thing I was thinking

1122
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:05,699
right so that's the other part is you

1123
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,318
can get a failed reversal

1124
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:09,659
and I know the white reverse as well

1125
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:12,739
Rascal did it consistently I've done it

1126
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:16,199
a few times so it's a good one

1127
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:18,358
interesting I mean I uh

1128
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:19,799
and that ladies and gentlemen is when

1129
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:22,259
you start talking to corporate guys

1130
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,420
about what they want why things like

1131
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,740
Jack Ferrer and Jack Herer hybrids are

1132
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,318
blended into everything because they're

1133
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:29,519
like I want three pounds of light gotta

1134
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,818
look pretty

1135
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,559
It's gotta be quick you know I want to

1136
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,779
sativa high and it's got to be eight

1137
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,480
weeks yeah and so then they're like oh

1138
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:42,060
c99 Jack Herrera like I remember when

1139
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,639
Colorado I was gonna make fun of you but

1140
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:47,460
I held off when Colorado went legal

1141
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,618
think like I remember that everybody was

1142
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:53,400
getting three pounds of light but it was

1143
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:56,640
all hybrids of Jack Herrera Durbin

1144
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,200
poison green crack and there was one

1145
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,318
more because there was anything that

1146
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:03,299
threw like big long forearms golden

1147
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,880
goats yeah and then they would just

1148
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,140
hybridize things looking for Finos that

1149
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,300
they would get three pounds of light

1150
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:10,980
yeah you know and so everything was

1151
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,780
crossed like one of those four things

1152
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,219
because they all looked at it from like

1153
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,400
mathematics

1154
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:19,618
you know I think um I think uh

1155
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,700
realistically why c99 still is popular

1156
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:26,700
today even easy even more so than um

1157
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:28,980
even more so than Jack Herrera even I

1158
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:30,719
think c99 still dominates is because of

1159
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,818
the outdoor scene in California and

1160
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,139
because of that demand for a sativa type

1161
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:37,019
that's super fast flowering that

1162
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:38,460
finishes in time in NorCal and I tend to

1163
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:40,980
think Appalachia is going to be what

1164
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,960
totally wipes c99 out when enough people

1165
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,659
run it it had a good it had a good run

1166
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,740
for a while uh by a high-end Lonesome

1167
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:49,019
when he originally made it and then

1168
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:51,179
Bodhi did a bunch of crosses with it but

1169
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,519
um I still think it's got It's it's a

1170
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:56,578
big run coming Jack does carry the

1171
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:59,460
terpenolene Terps for Generations yep

1172
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:01,980
you know uh Green Crack is actually a

1173
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,480
really nice strain grown well yeah most

1174
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,858
people have got a bad name because there

1175
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,139
was a bunch of people that would grow

1176
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:10,139
six to ten pound outdoor plants kind of

1177
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:12,299
be great of it and got blown out but

1178
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:13,500
if you grow a nice little four to eight

1179
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,599
ounce plant

1180
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,358
and and you know and you treat it right

1181
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,039
it's got some nice Terps it's got a

1182
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:23,460
sweet high it's not like knock you out

1183
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:25,679
like but it's it's pretty you know it

1184
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,720
might be my like if it is mostly skunk

1185
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:31,500
one it might be my favorite example of

1186
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:32,939
Scotland yeah yeah I would say like just

1187
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,099
the way sometimes like when it comes out

1188
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,280
really nice the bud is really green and

1189
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:40,980
the the crystal is really silvery

1190
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:44,099
you know and it's it's got a nice sweet

1191
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:46,858
terp to it yeah there's a good chance it

1192
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,599
might be a Mendo perp skunk one of sorts

1193
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:51,779
I I do think that

1194
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:54,000
Green Crack yeah holy [ __ ] that would

1195
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,319
trip me out yeah I mean it's mango

1196
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,179
Turkey

1197
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:58,440
um it's very purple with even the

1198
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:00,358
slightest bit of cold but I mean it's

1199
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,159
like black people say where can I find

1200
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:04,559
it that's the thing is that real Green

1201
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,059
Crack was so common that and all of a

1202
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,239
sudden it's like really hard to find the

1203
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:11,759
real one yes and you know it got renamed

1204
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:13,439
honestly in like the people doesn't read

1205
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,740
its name people because real because

1206
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,720
Green Crack got a bad name like Brokers

1207
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:21,059
put off on it but then when the extract

1208
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,279
era happened I'm convinced that there's

1209
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:24,420
a bunch of papaya that's just [ __ ]

1210
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,880
green crack

1211
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,818
it could be yeah you know I'm not saying

1212
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,280
100 all of it but like when you abstract

1213
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:34,619
green crack and you wash it it has nice

1214
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,960
tropical fruit Terps some people get

1215
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,940
papaya some people get mango some people

1216
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,039
get whiffs of other things depending on

1217
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:44,039
their nose or whatever

1218
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:48,300
um but you know it it has that similar

1219
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:50,519
profile yeah in that regard you know but

1220
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,079
I I think because of certain traits

1221
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,639
there's a good chance that mental

1222
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,380
purpose tend to be in that lineage I'm

1223
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:57,239
surprised you'd never noticed that one I

1224
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,619
would I would honestly trip out if that

1225
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,139
was the I mean I've been wrong before

1226
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:03,300
yeah I'll I'll say that and we've had

1227
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:05,578
good friends of ours that that told me

1228
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,800
things that I was just like oh no and

1229
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:11,160
then later on I was like whoa whoa you

1230
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,440
know so it's it's possible but

1231
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:15,539
um you know I the story of that one is

1232
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,858
pretty mysterious it is very mysterious

1233
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:20,818
because there's

1234
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:22,199
um the tale of of Cecil and when I when

1235
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:25,739
I first encountered it was through

1236
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:28,500
through uh James Hall he had green crack

1237
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:30,179
but we had it labeled as green Kush with

1238
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,940
a c in our room and it actually said

1239
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:35,219
green like written out cushed with the

1240
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,720
sea so because of that when I first went

1241
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:39,299
online people were talking about how

1242
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,098
well Cecil C has a Kush with a c so for

1243
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,079
a long time me and Cecil tried to meet

1244
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,059
up so we could talk about this stuff and

1245
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,859
figure it out and when we finally talked

1246
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:49,500
it sounds like his Kush with the sea was

1247
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:51,480
very skunky like he says the one that he

1248
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,760
said to San Diego was very skunky which

1249
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,920
is not like the green crack or the green

1250
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,599
Kush that was in San Diego

1251
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,338
um I don't know if it originates in San

1252
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,099
Diego I don't know if it originates in

1253
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:03,838
Mendo or up up in Humboldt it could be

1254
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:05,579
from freaking Oregon for all we know

1255
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:08,400
with a different name I know it made it

1256
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,500
to SoCal with the name uh bring Kush

1257
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,660
with the season oh yeah and then became

1258
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,039
Green Crack after that people are

1259
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:15,598
throwing around different things people

1260
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:17,699
are asking like well how do you Source

1261
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,019
what you're breeding with and to be

1262
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:21,000
honest

1263
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,440
um you know like I never really did a

1264
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,780
bunch of breeding projects where I had

1265
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,900
to go out and like have a treasure your

1266
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,220
map and find the things I wanted

1267
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:31,440
mostly you end up reading with stuff you

1268
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,000
have access to yeah let's be real we

1269
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,220
were creating a hypothetical situation

1270
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,679
and I tend to have a so I tended to pick

1271
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:39,598
things in my library not hypothetical

1272
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,460
things I'd have to get but like actual

1273
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,740
things that I possess yeah because

1274
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,019
that's just where my mind goes right it

1275
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:47,519
would be infinitely harder to like be

1276
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:49,079
like oh well I need to do a project

1277
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,579
that's going to take three or four steps

1278
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,318
and I need to gather

1279
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,720
a bunch of different things that are

1280
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:56,159
going to be new to me you know and

1281
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,259
there's an aspect people are talking

1282
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,299
about I don't think philosophilos can't

1283
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:03,480
actually determine family relationships

1284
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,000
the way that we did one day one day we

1285
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:09,059
will sit down and a few of us will tell

1286
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,179
the story about how we put philos's

1287
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:14,838
science to the test by using known

1288
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:17,578
clones known parentage of these clones

1289
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:20,179
and submitted them to philos to see if

1290
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:22,318
they could truly determine parentage

1291
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:23,818
yeah there's an aspect too where people

1292
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,559
are saying green crack and blue dream

1293
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:28,800
got played out right at the same time

1294
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:30,480
yeah there's there's an aspect you know

1295
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,940
because I live in Mendocino County or

1296
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,000
whatever like and for a long time it was

1297
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,858
sort of like the heart of of uh you know

1298
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,420
outdoor and stuff in California before

1299
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:41,940
it spread

1300
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,559
um a lot of times you would have plants

1301
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,420
that were really nice on their own like

1302
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,219
the blue dream or the green crack or the

1303
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,280
berry white or the this whatever it

1304
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:52,618
might be and they get there's an era

1305
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,060
where like they're really popular and

1306
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:56,039
they're and they're moving really well

1307
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:58,078
and their people are growing really nice

1308
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:59,579
examples of them and then there's a

1309
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,900
point where people realize how much

1310
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,420
money they can make and they can throw

1311
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,639
out 99 plants and get eight pounds of

1312
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,440
plant and you do the math and so all of

1313
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:09,779
a sudden there's all this B and C grade

1314
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,240
of the same strain and it kind of

1315
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:15,480
harshes the strain out so a lot of times

1316
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:17,578
people will be like oh that strain sucks

1317
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,159
and really what happened is the market

1318
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:22,318
got exploded by a bunch of low quality

1319
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,179
enormous waves of it because it was

1320
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,599
super profitable

1321
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:30,179
um and then the you know the you know it

1322
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,460
moves on and so people move on you grow

1323
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:34,139
a little four ounce plant of green crack

1324
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:37,920
or blue dream you'd probably be prepared

1325
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:39,420
happy yeah yeah you grow it nice you

1326
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,280
know you grow a little three four ounce

1327
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,838
plan of it like you'd probably be stoked

1328
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,720
and so are your buddies

1329
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:47,699
Blue Dream because I was still very

1330
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:49,500
heavily involved in the seed seed

1331
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:52,318
business when Blue Dream got real big

1332
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,838
and all that got blown up and what I saw

1333
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,119
happen right before my eyes was there

1334
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:58,980
was a few of us that made s1s of that

1335
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:02,039
original cut and released it in some

1336
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:06,000
good hybrids and then we saw

1337
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:07,980
major Spanish companies making seedlines

1338
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,199
called blue dream that had nothing to do

1339
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,780
with blue dream to cut they would

1340
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,879
combine like a blueberry and their hazes

1341
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,579
whatever they had and put that on the

1342
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,740
market and uh I don't want to name any

1343
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:21,300
names or anything but certain companies

1344
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:23,098
would buy these import them to the US

1345
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,440
and all of a sudden these Blue Dream

1346
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,059
seeds were everywhere the attitude was

1347
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,380
doing giveaways with everything you

1348
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:31,619
bought you would get these Blue Dream

1349
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,358
seeds so blue dream hit the country in

1350
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:35,700
Mass but it wasn't blue dream it was

1351
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,679
blueberry haze from some Spanish company

1352
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:39,299
with the with the California Market

1353
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,578
getting the majority of the actual Blue

1354
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,740
Dream bus right and I mean there's an

1355
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:47,880
aspect too where I think that for most

1356
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:50,818
plants there's a window of uh of quality

1357
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,619
yeah you know it it varies plant to

1358
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:54,179
plant but I actually think a lot of the

1359
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:56,099
indoor look

1360
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:57,960
is just because people are growing

1361
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:02,300
relatively small plants compared to

1362
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,300
outside and yeah you know

1363
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,680
so you're only asking a plant to give

1364
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,358
you say like one to eight ounces it'll

1365
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,739
have a vastly different look than if

1366
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,719
you're asking that plant to give you a

1367
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:15,959
pound or two pounds or three pounds or

1368
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:18,480
eight pounds right yeah um and I've had

1369
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,280
I've had times where it was like when we

1370
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,858
were transplanting and stuff like some

1371
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,019
plants got broken off at the stem yeah

1372
00:52:22,858 --> 00:52:26,759
you know and so not used and so I would

1373
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:29,460
grow these like depths and these plants

1374
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,020
would get like a pound and then like

1375
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,240
helpers wouldn't want to throw away the

1376
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:35,400
ones we broke so there'd be like a

1377
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:37,979
branch this Bay a stem this big with a

1378
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,599
few branches coming off it and when we

1379
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:43,380
pulled that stuff down that lift stuff

1380
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,940
looks so amazing compared to compared to

1381
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,380
like the the rest of it because it was

1382
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,659
like three ounces

1383
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,099
yeah and it was just super Frosty and

1384
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:52,618
choked out so there's an aspect

1385
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:54,599
certainly with different plants of like

1386
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:57,300
there's a size sweet spot

1387
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,980
yeah where you get it I like blue dream

1388
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,539
at four to six ounces that's where it

1389
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,358
was like just [ __ ] perfect every

1390
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:05,279
[ __ ] time most weed is if it's gonna

1391
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:08,159
be good weed you know that's a decent

1392
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,079
that it can it can get that big you know

1393
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,699
uh some plants can get to a half pound

1394
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,680
some plants can get to a pound but

1395
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:16,500
there's a there's a point of diminishing

1396
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,358
quality yeah absolutely you know where

1397
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,858
it's like the resin doesn't stretch or

1398
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:22,679
the Terps don't stretch or the plant

1399
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:25,019
just has to put so much energy into its

1400
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,639
stem and its structure and it's how it's

1401
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:30,000
going to survive it doesn't have enough

1402
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:31,920
to put into you know it's the quality of

1403
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,019
its wheat yeah I mean there's people

1404
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,700
that swear that small little plants in

1405
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:39,059
one gallon pots

1406
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:42,719
you know or or is the headiest wheat

1407
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:46,019
yeah that's I know that um when CSI was

1408
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,159
talking about shabad's uh sour that he

1409
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:49,619
talks about is like some of the best

1410
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:51,598
Smokies ever had out of it millions of

1411
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:53,338
plants he's probably smoked

1412
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,318
um he always says that you know it was

1413
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:57,539
in a one gallon pot in the flower or

1414
00:53:55,318 --> 00:54:00,358
power flower and that's it

1415
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:02,639
yeah I mean so there's an aspect there's

1416
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:05,219
an aspect there where it's like you I

1417
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:08,179
mean I used to actually do uh a bunch of

1418
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:11,399
breeding that way right once I got smart

1419
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:13,259
uh smarter I said I I suppose I should

1420
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,139
say because I used to just grow up all

1421
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,940
these [ __ ] seeds and granted the era

1422
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:19,318
was different but still you get all this

1423
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,300
random weed that you didn't like very

1424
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:22,380
much yeah because let's face it when

1425
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,700
you're breeding it's like you're only

1426
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:28,079
gonna like so much of it yeah you know

1427
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:30,358
and then I got smart instead of like

1428
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,760
blooming the seeds I would grow them up

1429
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,980
and I would take cuts and I would put

1430
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,720
them into like a one gallon pot and I

1431
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:40,858
would grow like on a you know I might

1432
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:42,959
grow like 50 or 100 plants on a 4x8

1433
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:45,058
and I'm just going for like a single

1434
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,639
stock try to get a half ounce

1435
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:49,740
yeah but that half ounce will tell me

1436
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:52,259
does it have the Terps does it have the

1437
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:54,598
high that's enough smoke and then maybe

1438
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,339
I can grow out a hundred things at once

1439
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,900
and it's small enough to still know

1440
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:59,219
you're getting the quality the ultimate

1441
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,900
quality that you can get from that plant

1442
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:02,279
without having to push it hard yeah and

1443
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,599
you're starting from a clone because

1444
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,220
that's the other thing that I realized

1445
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,559
is like a lot of times I wanted to see

1446
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:09,598
like what a clone would do yeah because

1447
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:11,519
you only get one shot at the seat yeah

1448
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,079
you only ever see that seat one yeah

1449
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,420
it's got a Tap Root it's gonna act

1450
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,160
differently yeah so I got more

1451
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,139
consistent when I just like when I would

1452
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:21,420
just take I would breed and I would I

1453
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:22,799
wouldn't flower the seed plants I would

1454
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,300
flower the Clones

1455
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,800
yeah I would want to see what they did

1456
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,780
as clones and then I could flower almost

1457
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,940
like a sea of green Style

1458
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,920
and then you could have 100 or 150

1459
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:35,159
things and if they're like you know 10

1460
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,940
to 20 ounce 10 to 20 grams each maybe a

1461
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:38,098
zip

1462
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,940
yeah and that's one thing that's one

1463
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:40,800
thing I've been trying to teach

1464
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,159
everybody that's watched like breeder

1465
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,440
Syndicate or my my live streams uh since

1466
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,659
I started doing them is when you buy

1467
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,400
seeds when you buy seeds and you're

1468
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:51,899
popping seeds you know a lot of people

1469
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,500
run into

1470
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,660
um

1471
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,699
sexual instability issues all kinds of

1472
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:57,960
other issues or they like it the one

1473
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:00,299
time and they don't like it the rest and

1474
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,579
they don't understand why you know I

1475
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,619
always tell them I always say don't

1476
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:06,839
worry about blooming the mom don't worry

1477
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:08,160
about blooming the seed mom Bloom the

1478
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:09,838
Clone mom because that's what you're

1479
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,699
going to see every time and that's what

1480
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:12,779
matters that's what that's what matters

1481
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:16,259
that's where you need to make your

1482
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,480
choices from and it'll at 99 of the time

1483
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,640
any sexual instability issues are gone

1484
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,199
with the Clone 99 time for whatever

1485
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,480
reason that's how it works it's just

1486
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:26,399
different hormones so yeah but yeah I

1487
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,519
mean I used to get two ounces four

1488
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,720
ounces five ounces eight ounces all

1489
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,119
these different plants all these

1490
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,739
different sizes all all that and like

1491
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,119
it's hard to do that but you can

1492
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:37,979
actually go through a bunch of plants

1493
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:41,039
and you really don't need to me you

1494
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,838
really don't need more than you know 10

1495
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:44,940
or 20 grams should give you like a

1496
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:47,099
really good idea yeah whether or not

1497
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,559
which ones you like enough to like work

1498
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:50,880
with again yeah and that's good that

1499
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:53,160
could be done on one or two four by

1500
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,318
eights yeah it doesn't even take that

1501
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,779
much you know and then you and then you

1502
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:59,159
know I would just toss the seat bomb and

1503
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,720
I would just keep clunk you know

1504
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,399
clones's back up

1505
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,439
yeah and as soon as they grew a little

1506
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,720
bit just flip them and I wanted to see

1507
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,119
like what the main the main stem would

1508
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:13,639
do wouldn't top them just try to get

1509
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:15,599
Spears yeah relatively speaking Yeah

1510
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:17,578
I mean it's not the only way to do it

1511
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,720
but it is a way for people a lot of

1512
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:21,359
people these days are going to have

1513
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:23,459
smaller size areas to work with and then

1514
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,598
if you did that into a greenhouse you

1515
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,920
could look what you could look through

1516
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,559
three or four hundred plants if you

1517
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,780
wanted yeah but the hard part is going

1518
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,900
to be testing it

1519
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,460
is always labeling drying it keeping it

1520
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,960
separate I mean you know Caleb he's got

1521
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:39,900
[ __ ] hangers with all kinds of

1522
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,519
color-coded labels on them and notes and

1523
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,200
[ __ ] and then you're trying to keep them

1524
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,480
all separate and different plastic bag

1525
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:47,460
or different jars or whatever

1526
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,760
and then you're trying to like smoke and

1527
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:53,880
take notes so let's talk about like the

1528
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,740
the downside of doing too big of a pop

1529
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,720
that's what I was just saying you know I

1530
00:57:55,739 --> 00:58:00,239
was like how do you you know like

1531
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:02,879
there's an aspect of like

1532
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,858
um doing too big of a pump

1533
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,880
is cool in the sense that when you're

1534
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:08,039
looking for certain physical

1535
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,660
characteristics you're going through

1536
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:12,239
more faster

1537
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:15,779
yeah right and so you can you can you

1538
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:17,879
can sift through but then you know

1539
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:19,819
um you know smoke testing let's say you

1540
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,920
have 50 things

1541
00:58:19,818 --> 00:58:24,800
smoke testing all that takes a while

1542
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,539
and you usually got to engage friends

1543
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,579
yeah let's say you have 13

1544
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:33,960
000 things though

1545
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:36,298
that was yeah I mean that was uh at that

1546
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,920
point you're not really Fino I mean

1547
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:40,858
you're you're not really Fino hunting

1548
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,900
you're doing some Fino hunting but you

1549
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:46,199
realize that like the vast majority of

1550
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:47,940
it it's gonna get lost to time yeah you

1551
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:49,379
know there's no time I mean you know we

1552
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,440
have a pretty big thing going right now

1553
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,240
with some of Caleb's work and it's it's

1554
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,599
like we really get to see what's in the

1555
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:59,159
line yeah and how it expresses right but

1556
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,859
the vast majority of them are going to

1557
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:03,719
be kept for any reason yeah vast

1558
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:05,639
majority can't be smoked I mean it's

1559
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:06,959
just to get to that like if you're let's

1560
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:10,259
say you're popping

1561
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,760
2 000. like how are you gonna smoke that

1562
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,140
within a certain amount of period unless

1563
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,299
you just have people chiefing for free

1564
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:18,000
all day and those [ __ ] don't go

1565
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:19,619
away you know yeah I mean there's an

1566
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,420
aspect where really like for a hobby

1567
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:23,400
Gardener I mean a lot of depending on

1568
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,838
how people smoke even if you did 60 or

1569
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,539
70 things

1570
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:29,460
it would take you you know if you smoked

1571
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:31,858
two or three of them a day

1572
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,559
you know it would take you you know

1573
00:59:31,858 --> 00:59:36,838
almost a month yeah to sort through it

1574
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,579
yeah and so you know

1575
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:40,259
um you know and then you could also have

1576
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,940
certain kinds of criteria maybe some

1577
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:44,040
things you smoke one bowl of and it

1578
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,960
doesn't have the flavor it you don't

1579
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:48,659
like it you just immediately you know

1580
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,119
but then it's like how fine of a comb

1581
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:52,858
yeah you know

1582
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,140
um people say cut a clone latent flower

1583
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:56,818
you know there's a lot of uh there's a

1584
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:59,818
lot of Euros that don't like to keep

1585
00:59:56,818 --> 01:00:01,619
backup clones and they'll literally do

1586
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:03,960
this thing where they'll leave all the

1587
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:04,980
bottoms on their plants and they'll

1588
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,139
Bloom them

1589
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,780
and their favorites they'll just like

1590
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:13,798
move before the plant's fully finished

1591
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:15,298
and re-vege the bottoms yeah you know

1592
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:18,119
the problem with that that there's

1593
01:00:15,298 --> 01:00:19,920
nothing wrong with that method

1594
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,260
um because a lot of times the easiest

1595
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:25,559
things to re-vadge are like the poorly

1596
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:28,500
floured out uh you know wispy [ __ ] on

1597
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:32,400
the bottom so you can cut a plant down

1598
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,619
and smoke it and be re-veging it

1599
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,838
um but it does take months

1600
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:39,480
it does it takes a few months for it to

1601
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:41,400
start kicking back yeah it's like I did

1602
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,818
it a ton for a long time

1603
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,220
um when I would do uh uh final hunts

1604
01:00:44,818 --> 01:00:50,219
because I would try to do as big of a

1605
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:52,379
Fino hunt as I could do in with as many

1606
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:54,058
different lines and what usually ended

1607
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,338
up happening was that I couldn't keep

1608
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:58,980
you know four clones of every single

1609
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:01,199
thing that I was hunting through so I

1610
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,298
had to get really good at reveging I had

1611
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,980
to get it right every [ __ ] time and

1612
01:01:03,298 --> 01:01:06,179
figure out how to do that and eventually

1613
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,338
I figured out how to do that and be

1614
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:11,279
consistent with it but it's hard and it

1615
01:01:08,338 --> 01:01:12,539
takes a long [ __ ] time my buddy I was

1616
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,280
mentioning that I did the maple project

1617
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:16,199
he was he that he was just saying he

1618
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,359
does 50 60 things at a time and it's a

1619
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:20,219
[ __ ] yeah you know it's like you have

1620
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:22,380
lives it's not that easy to like it's

1621
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:24,838
one thing to get baked every day it's

1622
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:27,420
another thing to like take notes and see

1623
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:28,980
how you feel and you know be looking for

1624
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,318
certain aspects of things so you either

1625
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:34,318
have to be a super harsh dick or It

1626
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:37,079
Takes a Minute yeah you know

1627
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:37,980
um and and so and a lot of times what

1628
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,579
sucks

1629
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:43,260
you know is that uh you know the runty

1630
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:44,519
shitty [ __ ] up plant that you almost

1631
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,559
killed

1632
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:49,139
ends up being the most interesting one

1633
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,880
to smoke in flavor yeah and all the ones

1634
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:53,279
that had all the structure and growth

1635
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,858
and vigor that you wanted were were oh

1636
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,140
just you know okay compared to some of

1637
01:01:55,858 --> 01:01:59,699
those other ones yeah it's always the

1638
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:01,199
scrawny shitty one that doesn't want to

1639
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:03,179
revege the most stubborn one that's

1640
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:06,239
usually the one I want to keep yeah I

1641
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:08,399
mean obviously I mean imagine imagine if

1642
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,558
you know the OG craze happened but like

1643
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,480
OG grew like blue dream

1644
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,920
yeah

1645
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,170
there really would be blue dream

1646
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,000
billionaires

1647
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:20,700
[Laughter]

1648
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,318
you know and all that because it's like

1649
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:23,639
that but that's the that's the kind of

1650
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:24,838
Interest maybe we could talk about that

1651
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,358
for a minute

1652
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:29,279
um because well it's interesting is that

1653
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,619
I was talking about like when things

1654
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,298
went legal in Colorado and all of a

1655
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:35,099
sudden all these high-yielding plants

1656
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:37,739
started getting bred into all the indoor

1657
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:40,980
because that's what met the model yeah

1658
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:44,598
there is a risk uh as Things become

1659
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:47,280
legal that the weird runty [ __ ] up

1660
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:51,059
offshoots that we all know and love that

1661
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,740
end up becoming like our Elites get cold

1662
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,940
yeah because they don't meet the

1663
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:55,858
production model

1664
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,500
well I remember

1665
01:02:55,858 --> 01:03:01,318
um even even when sub cool was at the

1666
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:03,119
height of of breeding Fame I would call

1667
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:04,679
it even what he would what he had what I

1668
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,559
would call is genuine Fame at one point

1669
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:09,719
that dude was pretty famous and um he

1670
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:10,940
was putting it out there

1671
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:14,098
um

1672
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:16,500
my [ __ ] I'm gonna interrupt then for a

1673
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:18,359
second uh go ahead our homie from Hawaii

1674
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,159
was saying taking Cuts two or three

1675
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:22,440
weeks into flower is nice they stay

1676
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:24,558
small and about the time they re-veg

1677
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:28,139
you're finishing up the round

1678
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:30,180
That's What CSI does a whole bunch uh

1679
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:32,159
his primary method is to take clones

1680
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:34,558
clean up the bottoms about two weeks

1681
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:36,480
into into bloom

1682
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,579
um and then that and then that slows

1683
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,500
down and they freak out for a while but

1684
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:42,780
they kind of are on the same timing as

1685
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,000
your room so around the time you figure

1686
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:47,339
out which ones are good

1687
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,599
um or hope you know they're because they

1688
01:03:47,338 --> 01:03:50,578
get because you can get them too big and

1689
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:52,859
then you're chopping them back

1690
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:54,960
yeah I was gonna say sub cool he would

1691
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:57,960
call a lot of seeds in the seedling

1692
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,420
stage like in the seedling stains he

1693
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,338
would do major culling and I was always

1694
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,960
a big opponent of that because I found

1695
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,358
that like a lot of the slower growing

1696
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,280
stuff can be just as amazing a Keepers

1697
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:10,318
for different reasons you know but for a

1698
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,819
while that that was in cannabis and

1699
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:15,298
still kind of is a common thought that

1700
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:16,980
if it's weak as a Seedling call it well

1701
01:04:15,298 --> 01:04:19,920
I mean there's nothing wrong with that

1702
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,780
in in a certain aspect but then it's

1703
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,298
just making it harder to find what you

1704
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:25,859
want because you're trying to guarantee

1705
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:28,139
that it's going to be in a strong and

1706
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:29,880
vigorous plan exactly and if there's one

1707
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:32,000
thing we know about cannabis is that

1708
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,500
like the week the weak shitty ones

1709
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,199
sometimes have a tendency of being like

1710
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,239
the Market's favorite yeah OG Kush I

1711
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,159
can't even believe that wasn't called at

1712
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:43,558
the beginning just to how floppy limbed

1713
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:46,199
and it has so many traits that that are

1714
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:48,420
hard hard I mean let's talk about you

1715
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:50,460
know do you know the thing that I will

1716
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:52,338
put this number one all time I can't

1717
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:54,358
believe it was cold

1718
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:58,798
the quays

1719
01:04:54,358 --> 01:05:01,199
oh yeah yeah the wild one how how can

1720
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:04,318
you grow something that takes that long

1721
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:07,439
and every bud is like a tiny fingernail

1722
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:09,119
sized [ __ ] calyx Ripper yeah and it

1723
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,420
becomes one of the more famous strains

1724
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,858
in in Holland uh that was a labor of

1725
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,480
love because there's a bunch of people

1726
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:19,139
that would look at that halfway through

1727
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:21,240
and be like what a mess deaths so I I

1728
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:22,318
got Finos like that or expressions like

1729
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:24,439
that from

1730
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:29,579
um Alaskan ice seeds that I purchased

1731
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:30,960
from uh seed Madness I want to say in

1732
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:31,980
the UK

1733
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,199
um

1734
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,760
yeah it spit out females like that and

1735
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:36,838
they were immediately called like I

1736
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,760
didn't think anything of it it was

1737
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:40,259
before I had ever seen or run the

1738
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,819
question yeah you would just kill it

1739
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,660
you'd be like this is super [ __ ] this

1740
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:46,980
is the worst thing ever this is horrible

1741
01:05:44,659 --> 01:05:48,480
yeah this is [ __ ] ridiculous so you

1742
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,280
just kill it you know and that's

1743
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,440
actually what Neville did to about half

1744
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:54,298
his Haze seeds that popped yeah because

1745
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,858
they were so sparse and [ __ ] up that

1746
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:58,139
he didn't realize what he had and he

1747
01:05:55,858 --> 01:06:00,420
called him and then he smoked it uh and

1748
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:02,159
then yeah somebody was saying oh gkb OG

1749
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,200
KB is an excellent example of something

1750
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:08,098
that would never make a production model

1751
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:11,399
yeah super slow takes forever to badge

1752
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:13,619
doesn't yield that much you know all

1753
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,579
that and so I always think of tomatoes

1754
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:16,260
right

1755
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:18,660
because there's been this heirloom

1756
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:21,839
tomato sort of Renaissance in America

1757
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:23,399
yeah um but when people are like you go

1758
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:25,338
to the grocery store you see lots of

1759
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:29,940
delicious vegetables or whatever but

1760
01:06:25,338 --> 01:06:33,719
tomatoes are bred for size and weight

1761
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:36,420
and color and to not rot and to not

1762
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:38,279
split and flavor is way down there so

1763
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,740
the tomatoes that get stuffed into most

1764
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:42,960
people's grocery stores are like big

1765
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:45,239
money making watery

1766
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,519
it's like all the production values are

1767
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:49,199
Paramount yeah and the part where it's

1768
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,420
delicious and it tastes good and it has

1769
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,759
the flavors that we want like we can't

1770
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,079
force them to do that which is why a lot

1771
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,920
of people think store-bought Tomatoes

1772
01:06:55,079 --> 01:07:00,480
suck yeah

1773
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,460
so but what I mean by that well yeah but

1774
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,139
what I mean by that is that like as

1775
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:06,179
cannabis goes into a production model

1776
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:08,460
and they start looking at square footage

1777
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:10,500
and cost and yield and this and that and

1778
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:13,740
everything else there could be very

1779
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:16,739
different uh pressures put on what

1780
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:19,618
strains make it to the public yeah the

1781
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:22,019
OG would never have made it the ogkb

1782
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:23,579
would never have made it the qua the you

1783
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:25,559
know the quays would never have made it

1784
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:27,660
like there's a lot of varieties out

1785
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:29,339
there for one reason or another that

1786
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:32,279
wouldn't fit somebody's production model

1787
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:34,380
yeah I was always surprised when cookies

1788
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,780
showed up like the form cut because it

1789
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,760
was so low yielding like so so low

1790
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:40,920
yielding uh compared to what was

1791
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,619
typically going around even even most OG

1792
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:45,180
cushes had been they've figured him out

1793
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:46,858
to make them yield their cookies was

1794
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:50,399
just so low yielding I was shocked that

1795
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:52,558
it ever got commercial viability I don't

1796
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,358
think it would have without I mean there

1797
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:58,579
was an aspect where prices were starting

1798
01:07:54,358 --> 01:08:01,078
to fall yeah and and Instagram was young

1799
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:03,539
and it was like a perfect moment where

1800
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,339
it gained a bunch of popularity and then

1801
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:06,900
it sold for high dollars so it was

1802
01:08:05,338 --> 01:08:09,480
almost kind of like the same thing with

1803
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,280
Kush right like and our buddy resin it's

1804
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,659
like sure you might not get as much

1805
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,059
weight as you were getting off other

1806
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:16,439
things until you figured it out but if

1807
01:08:15,059 --> 01:08:18,239
you were selling it for Seven Grand a

1808
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:20,818
pound you really didn't care yeah

1809
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,379
exactly you know that there was some

1810
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:25,259
there was some like oh I can get lower

1811
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:27,420
yields off this baked into it yeah

1812
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:29,640
you know but still and it's still uh

1813
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:32,219
yeah makes way more money than otherwise

1814
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:35,460
right and so there's an aspect now where

1815
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:38,159
it's like yeah biomass people are

1816
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:39,779
looking for like you know like weight on

1817
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:41,818
you know wet weight how much I can

1818
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:44,580
extract what's my yield what's my this

1819
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:46,859
where the previous selection process in

1820
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:50,939
cannabis was entirely consumer based

1821
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:52,199
yeah right almost all these fads needed

1822
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:54,479
a bunch of people at the other end

1823
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:56,278
willing to buy it for top dollar yeah

1824
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,439
that's what drove the purple craze

1825
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:00,359
that's what drove sour that's why sour

1826
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:02,698
was the best selling weed in America was

1827
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,319
because there was this massive Corridor

1828
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:07,738
on the East Coast that this couldn't get

1829
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,359
enough of it yeah right yeah it became

1830
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:10,858
part of the culture it became part of

1831
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,600
the culture you know and then cush had

1832
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:15,060
its whole moment in Southern California

1833
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,400
and elsewhere yeah you know and then

1834
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:18,960
cookies was the bay and then you know

1835
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:20,698
and you have Skittles winning all these

1836
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,619
Awards and stuff so a lot of that stuff

1837
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:24,659
is I mean we used to joke when we first

1838
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:27,479
got the real Skittles where it was like

1839
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:30,119
you'd start edging next year's death now

1840
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:32,879
yeah I did you know because it was like

1841
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:35,338
oh just give it a good six month veg and

1842
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,380
it'll be three feet tall yeah I remember

1843
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,640
the first time my buddy I had a I had a

1844
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,500
good friend of mine that got Skittles

1845
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,319
kind of before it was it was named that

1846
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:46,380
as much and he grew these plants he had

1847
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:48,480
light County beautiful sun 400 gallon

1848
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:50,100
pots you know all organic really nice

1849
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:52,198
and he called me up all panicked and

1850
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,298
wanted me to come out and I was like

1851
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:57,238
walking this was like back in the trees

1852
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:59,279
era so I'm walking through he has shot

1853
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:01,139
diesels and green cracks and you know

1854
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:03,599
different things and they're all you

1855
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:06,360
know nine ten feet tall trellised out

1856
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,160
you know scat all that and then you walk

1857
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:10,920
to this section and there's like five

1858
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:14,219
Skittles and they like come up to like

1859
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,260
my waist yeah I bet and they're all wide

1860
01:10:14,219 --> 01:10:17,880
and like little chunks and his buddy was

1861
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:20,100
like oh I'll give you like four times as

1862
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,960
much but you're looking at these like

1863
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:24,120
tiny little runts they were all started

1864
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,380
at the same time yeah and he thought he

1865
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:27,599
was [ __ ] up

1866
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:29,159
yeah he just didn't realize that it grew

1867
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,679
eight times as slow as anything else

1868
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:34,319
yeah

1869
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,179
um you know and so there's that aspect

1870
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:39,000
too where it was like Skittles would

1871
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:40,560
never pass any kind of production model

1872
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,738
Skittles looks like they've got a

1873
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,080
goddamn disease Skittles is ugly as

1874
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:48,539
flower for the most part you know which

1875
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:51,238
is fine I don't mind I I am totally a

1876
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:53,698
pre-cookie person so I'm fine with ugly

1877
01:10:51,238 --> 01:10:55,500
flour that works good yeah

1878
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:59,039
um but you know it it's very slow

1879
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:00,840
growing it's a bit mold prone

1880
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,340
um you know uh but none of that mattered

1881
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,860
when it was winning a bunch of awards

1882
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:06,600
for extraction exactly because you're

1883
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:08,759
just testing the extract and the hash

1884
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,560
was fire and that's that was my point

1885
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,780
about the potency aspect too it's like

1886
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,820
yeah I mean like it used to be a major

1887
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:16,139
deal that if the flower wasn't potent

1888
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:17,819
but that's not such a deal breaker

1889
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:20,820
anymore with the extract Market thriving

1890
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:22,500
no I mean in fact I'll you know I was

1891
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:24,960
joking with you about Citrus and it was

1892
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,698
it was a little I get me saying Citrus

1893
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,920
gave you a bunch of pads because there's

1894
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:30,779
a bunch of kinds of citrus and citrus

1895
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,060
for people that don't know also tends to

1896
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:35,099
breed fairly dominant yes you know

1897
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,380
orange things a lot of time past Orange

1898
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,460
grapefruit grapefruit lemon lemon that

1899
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,380
kind of thing right it's a pretty

1900
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:43,500
dominant term work

1901
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:46,140
um you know but a lot of times those

1902
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:49,380
um those Citrus cuts are pretty moderate

1903
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:52,260
to mild potency yeah there's not really

1904
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:54,179
a lot of ones that test very high or by

1905
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:56,520
themselves are particularly potent and

1906
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:58,800
so I almost think that like Tangy came

1907
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,840
along at a perfect time because it was

1908
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,239
like a big skunk plant here I am

1909
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:06,060
shouting out DNA or whatever but it was

1910
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:07,559
a big Citrus skunk plant at a time when

1911
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,520
a lot of people had forgotten about

1912
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,900
Citrus because it was so unpopular yeah

1913
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,219
coincided right with the extraction

1914
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:17,939
movement

1915
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:20,100
and that Citrus Turf passed or at the

1916
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:22,919
time a lot of other Terps kind of ended

1917
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:26,280
up tasting like axle grease and it also

1918
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:28,500
was not named Cali o no most importantly

1919
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:30,960
so people were like oh that's his no

1920
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,279
it's not named Calio and so and so I

1921
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,880
really I don't know if it would have

1922
01:12:32,279 --> 01:12:37,619
caught on without that BHO era being

1923
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,260
timed right then when people were

1924
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:42,000
getting nails and dab kit and all the

1925
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,579
different little tools and accoutrements

1926
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,899
that went along with it you know yeah

1927
01:12:44,579 --> 01:12:49,079
um and then it's like you take something

1928
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:51,719
that's like 15 THC and not that potent

1929
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:54,719
but if you extract it and it's 80 well

1930
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:56,399
now okay now we're somewhere yeah it

1931
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,719
might not be a long lasting high but

1932
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,479
it'll get you high

1933
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:01,739
I know there's something and we can keep

1934
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:03,000
talking about this but I know there's

1935
01:13:01,738 --> 01:13:04,439
something that people wanted you to

1936
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,020
cover and it's something that we missed

1937
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:08,879
last time a few times ago and it was

1938
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,440
your drawing Tech

1939
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,319
oh man

1940
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:14,698
well let me uh I'll talk about that let

1941
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:17,519
me just say because people are throwing

1942
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:18,899
in Calio so in that big hunt that we

1943
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,540
were doing

1944
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:24,679
um down south or whatever uh I ran a

1945
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:28,619
number of csis Calio hybrids

1946
01:13:24,679 --> 01:13:29,520
and I was actually amazed at how sativa

1947
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:32,939
it read

1948
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,560
yeah it really it really did like even

1949
01:13:32,939 --> 01:13:37,079
things that were pretty Indica that I

1950
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,199
thought would be would lean they were

1951
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:42,179
big tall branchy

1952
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:44,819
orange smelling

1953
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:47,520
you know yeah the grandpa weed looking

1954
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:49,859
uh phinos and stuff like that so it was

1955
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,360
it was a lot more in different hybrids

1956
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:54,119
it was a lot more sativa than I was

1957
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:57,000
expecting yeah right

1958
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:59,939
oh I'll say that and Cali o went through

1959
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,719
periods where it became so unpopular it

1960
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:06,178
was almost unsellable yes yes I it's the

1961
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:08,640
only weed well a type of Kaleo is the

1962
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:11,880
only weed someone ever brought back to

1963
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:14,159
me and said not not this didn't get me

1964
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,380
high yeah and there's an aspect with

1965
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,299
almost with a lot of very citrusy weed

1966
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,859
that's like that where people find the

1967
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,480
high to be some some people find the

1968
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:24,119
height of these fleeting or super

1969
01:14:21,479 --> 01:14:27,238
short-lived or they just develop a

1970
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:29,698
tolerance to it after two or three days

1971
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:31,678
um you know and uh and other people are

1972
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:33,419
fine with it but there is a percentage

1973
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,819
of people that develop a tolerance and

1974
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:36,899
find it boring yeah and there's

1975
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:38,219
definitely a difference someone said

1976
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:40,500
cleaner there's definitely a difference

1977
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:42,719
in Citrus there are some plants that are

1978
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,579
like sweet Citrus that have almost a

1979
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,679
creaminess to them yeah and then there's

1980
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:49,500
ones that smell like you just sprayed

1981
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:52,619
orange cleaner in your mouth yes very

1982
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:54,899
stringent and orange just pissed orange

1983
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:58,738
or a lemon you know something like that

1984
01:14:54,899 --> 01:15:01,679
just Berry like astringent and weird and

1985
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:03,779
and like you've sucked on a chemical you

1986
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,300
know yeah I I hate that that long

1987
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:09,059
lingering mouth-coating lemon like lemon

1988
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:10,860
G and lemon tree I can't stand that oh

1989
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,840
you just burn out I mean I'm one of

1990
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:14,639
those people I burn out it's fine to

1991
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,500
have it in rotation

1992
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,260
but if I was stuck with it as my only

1993
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:21,060
weed for a month I would be so bummed I

1994
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,800
I get yeah I don't even put it in

1995
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,539
rotation I don't like the tip flavor at

1996
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,400
all and but there was a moment where

1997
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:28,319
with BHO and certain things when that

1998
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:30,779
was super popular before rosin was

1999
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:33,179
really hitting that those Citrus Terps

2000
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:34,679
came through really clean and clear a

2001
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:37,380
lot of people made a lot of money off

2002
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:40,020
[ __ ] lemon G in Ohio yeah lemon G and

2003
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:42,659
and the Tangy I mean Tangy sort of

2004
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:44,520
rocketed DNA to being super busy for

2005
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:46,920
four or five years after that

2006
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:50,100
cracked it yeah I mean you know whatever

2007
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,658
whatever combination yeah Crockett you

2008
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:55,980
know so

2009
01:15:51,658 --> 01:15:57,960
um as far as drying Tech man that's a uh

2010
01:15:55,979 --> 01:15:59,519
that's a big subject but I could chat

2011
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:04,439
about it or whatever yeah this is your

2012
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:06,420
specialty man I will say that um

2013
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:08,759
I will say that like you know there's a

2014
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,158
lot of people that throw a lot of stuff

2015
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,539
out there as far as like what's drying

2016
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:15,599
Tech and I think there's a lot of like

2017
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:16,800
copycat stuff out there yeah um so for

2018
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,800
me

2019
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,960
um because I've always been a smoker uh

2020
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,779
I was always interested in making sure

2021
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:27,000
my weed came out nice yes right and

2022
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:30,539
curing it you know a lot of times people

2023
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,939
put an enormous amount of of uh uh

2024
01:16:30,539 --> 01:16:34,800
weight on what they feed their plant

2025
01:16:32,939 --> 01:16:36,779
and all that and like all these

2026
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,000
different environmental factors and

2027
01:16:36,779 --> 01:16:42,359
those those things can all throw in but

2028
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,238
if you don't cure it the right way

2029
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:47,460
um a lot of that gets overwhelmed yes

2030
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:49,319
you know and so there's an aspect where

2031
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:51,480
there's no point in my career rally

2032
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:53,639
really where I was competing on scale

2033
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:56,339
there was always way bigger people than

2034
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,960
me so I always tried to make sure even

2035
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,880
if there was a flood up in my neck of

2036
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:02,340
the woods that my weed was just good

2037
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:05,039
enough to go yeah

2038
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:07,319
right like some of it's gonna move yeah

2039
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:09,479
should be mine yeah you know what I mean

2040
01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:11,158
and so damn right and and so as a result

2041
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:12,119
of that you had to and then on top of

2042
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:14,759
that too

2043
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:16,559
it's like coming from like a my own

2044
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:20,100
perspective is like I never grew my head

2045
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:22,800
stash super separate too much so like I

2046
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:24,120
needed it all to be good yeah in that

2047
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,219
regard people are saying let's hear the

2048
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:27,599
dry Tech well there's like but it's it's

2049
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:30,600
just like the breeding Tech or whatever

2050
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,179
right there's like there's goals like

2051
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,739
what are you trying to do right and so

2052
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:36,658
one of the things I had to figure out

2053
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:39,119
was that and this is kind of what like

2054
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:40,619
separately led to caring is that there's

2055
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:42,420
this thing up here that we use now it's

2056
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:45,179
permanent but there's this thing we used

2057
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:47,760
to call that uh called the flood

2058
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:51,600
and the flood used to be November

2059
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:54,239
December January and it was it was way

2060
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,620
too hard to sell herb okay it's because

2061
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:57,238
you know people would go on vacation

2062
01:17:55,619 --> 01:17:59,399
people would go to see their families

2063
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:01,198
it's around the holidays some people

2064
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:03,299
like Hawaii some people are back home

2065
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:05,059
with Grandma and if enough links in

2066
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:08,039
those chains disappear

2067
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:10,080
people end up sitting on stuff yeah and

2068
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:11,640
then people figured out that there was a

2069
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:14,880
dry spell in Spring

2070
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:16,320
and so if you were if you were smart you

2071
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,079
would hold on to most of your stuff

2072
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,819
until spring when it would be both much

2073
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:22,859
easier and

2074
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:25,559
um much more higher price yeah higher

2075
01:18:22,859 --> 01:18:27,420
price right so that was good so uh is

2076
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,880
the flood happening this year this year

2077
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:32,039
the flood is the last few years the

2078
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:34,199
flood has seemingly never stopped we are

2079
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:36,420
yeah we are living in Water World

2080
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:38,899
there's been no receding there's been no

2081
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:41,940
price spiking going on it has been

2082
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:44,339
Atlantis man this is this is yes this is

2083
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:46,738
the ice caps melting as far as pricing

2084
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:49,739
goes on the west coast so

2085
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:51,658
um but what happened is is that you

2086
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:53,579
ended up needing to figure out like

2087
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:57,899
people realize that if they trimmed all

2088
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:59,158
their weed in in Fall it both cost a

2089
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:01,259
bunch of money because you had to pay

2090
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:02,939
the Tremors and then for the most part

2091
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:05,640
unless you were really careful about how

2092
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:07,139
you stored it your weed was worse in

2093
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:09,780
spring when you had to when you had to

2094
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:11,940
sell yeah and then sometimes you were

2095
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:13,500
growing enough that like you weren't

2096
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:14,939
even with the size trim crew you're

2097
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,640
gonna have it was going to take you a

2098
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:19,678
while to even get to that weed yeah so

2099
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:23,039
you had to be able to dry and cure it

2100
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:25,140
right in a way that it stayed nice yeah

2101
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,600
for a period of time for a variety of

2102
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:30,480
reasons yeah right and then there's an

2103
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,340
aspect where you can always like if you

2104
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:35,158
it's it's basically like you get one

2105
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:37,079
shot to do it the right way and you can

2106
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:38,759
like adapt along the way but if you [ __ ]

2107
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:40,500
up too bad you've just ruined it for

2108
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:42,840
that round yeah

2109
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,939
so I know that's like a I haven't really

2110
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,020
said anything about the tech but there's

2111
01:19:44,939 --> 01:19:48,539
like a

2112
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:52,440
a reasoning behind it of how you get

2113
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:53,760
there right so uh and for people that

2114
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:55,079
aren't Growers that are listening I'm

2115
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,460
sorry if you're bored or whatever but

2116
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:58,319
because it's about to get a little

2117
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:00,239
specific but

2118
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,420
um basically what I what the way I look

2119
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:05,339
at it is that when you're drawing weed

2120
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:07,640
I like to either cut the plant down

2121
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,640
whole

2122
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:14,819
um or chop it into chunks yeah okay

2123
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:16,079
relatively relatively big chunks okay

2124
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:18,779
um someone just said oh teach me your

2125
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:20,819
ways in an eight by four so

2126
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:23,219
um if you're worried about temps or

2127
01:20:20,819 --> 01:20:25,319
you're worried about water loss or

2128
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:26,880
you're a little extra dry you can leave

2129
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:29,158
it in bigger pieces

2130
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,359
yeah because those pieces will hold more

2131
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:32,099
moisture because there's a lot of

2132
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:33,719
moisture in the stem if you have really

2133
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,579
good control over your environment you

2134
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:38,399
can chop them into smaller mid-sized

2135
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:40,140
pieces and hang them that way

2136
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:42,479
um and I just hang them up

2137
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:45,239
um people can you can use hangers you

2138
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:46,979
can use netting uh you can use you know

2139
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:49,319
just a variety of things that allows you

2140
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:53,158
to click create lines or walls

2141
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:56,579
is basically how it boils down to and

2142
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:59,519
um I leave all the water leaf on yeah

2143
01:20:56,579 --> 01:21:01,559
100 I don't take off any water leaf and

2144
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:04,320
the reason for that is that the things

2145
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:08,039
that [ __ ] up your buds are

2146
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:11,279
um are uh basically air

2147
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:13,019
heat and light yeah right those are the

2148
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:16,439
things that start to oxidize your weed

2149
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:18,840
and start to mess it up okay so what all

2150
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:21,419
that families do is that they fold down

2151
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:23,640
over the flower and they essentially

2152
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:25,440
like if you have fans for air movement

2153
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:28,020
and stuff like that they're generally

2154
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:30,119
blowing on the fan leaves not on

2155
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:33,360
directly on your flower yeah and it's

2156
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:34,920
making your flower darker yeah right so

2157
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:37,259
it's protecting it from wind it's

2158
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,699
protecting it from from light it's

2159
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:41,100
protecting it from the various things

2160
01:21:38,698 --> 01:21:44,039
that might degrade it and

2161
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:46,199
as your plant starts to dry it'll suck

2162
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:48,539
that moisture from all those from all

2163
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:49,738
those leaves into itself yes and that's

2164
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:51,479
kind of what you're trying to do is

2165
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,379
you're trying to get you're trying to

2166
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:54,238
get

2167
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:57,779
um how do you put it you're trying to

2168
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:59,579
slowly sweat out enough moisture gotten

2169
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:01,559
enough chlorophyll right so you want

2170
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:04,380
this to be a slow process do you want it

2171
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:06,500
to be a slow process so I see all kinds

2172
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:10,380
of things where people talk about 60 60

2173
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:13,679
you know 60 degrees and 60 humidity for

2174
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:14,819
two weeks uh I do disagree on that a

2175
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,880
little bit

2176
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:19,559
um I think the 60 humidity is fine

2177
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:22,020
um but I think that that's actually like

2178
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,780
a little too cold yeah you know and it

2179
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:27,540
really slows down uh transpiration at

2180
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:31,319
times I like it I think the 60s is fine

2181
01:22:27,539 --> 01:22:33,060
I like I like uh you know mid 60s and

2182
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:35,158
anywhere really realistically speaking

2183
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:38,100
from mid 60s to low 70s you're pretty

2184
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:39,719
safe yeah you know in my opinion like

2185
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,739
there's ideal and then there's like what

2186
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:43,260
you're going to deal with and then

2187
01:22:40,738 --> 01:22:47,039
there's an aspect of like

2188
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:49,320
um there's a there's an aspect of uh

2189
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:52,198
when you're hanging it the first three

2190
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:54,840
or four days a whole bunch of water is

2191
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:56,460
going to flow out of those plants yeah

2192
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,860
so depending on how much weed you have

2193
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,539
and how much space it is like it doesn't

2194
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:02,158
really matter if you have a stuffed four

2195
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:04,079
by eight or you have a stuffed big

2196
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:06,359
garage or you have a stuffed Warehouse

2197
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,738
or whatever whatever size it is if it's

2198
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:09,479
stuffed

2199
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:12,059
um you know it can be really hard to

2200
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:14,939
have enough dehumidification yeah in

2201
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:17,340
order to pull that much water out of it

2202
01:23:14,939 --> 01:23:19,799
so a lot of people lose control or

2203
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:21,480
whatever like the and you know a lot of

2204
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,760
D homes don't even like to work at 60

2205
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:25,259
degrees either yeah so having them a bit

2206
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,179
warmer really helps it but that's one

2207
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:29,100
thing people should all look at is that

2208
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:31,319
there's a bunch of dehumidifiers if you

2209
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:33,420
don't have a low-grain refrigerant d-hum

2210
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:36,539
you probably don't have a d-hum that's

2211
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:37,800
suitable for drying yeah and most d-hums

2212
01:23:36,539 --> 01:23:39,719
are rated for a certain temperature

2213
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:41,699
which is quite warm and a certain

2214
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:42,840
humidity which is quite high and you

2215
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:45,719
should look at like where their

2216
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:48,539
operating temperature is right so if the

2217
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:52,260
D hum says it's stub operating at 58

2218
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:54,238
degrees yeah don't run your room at 60.

2219
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,860
yeah it's too close to it just not

2220
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:57,419
working you should probably run it at 70

2221
01:23:55,859 --> 01:24:00,420
and give your D home a chance to work

2222
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:02,520
right yeah so but if you have a low

2223
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:04,800
grain refrigerant d-hum

2224
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,300
um it'll work at those temps so there's

2225
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,619
basically a mode where it's like you're

2226
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:09,779
just trying to make sure your weed

2227
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:11,460
doesn't mold and you get that humidity

2228
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:13,198
you're trying to keep it cool and you're

2229
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:15,779
trying to get that humidity out of there

2230
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:17,519
yeah some people vent you know some

2231
01:24:15,779 --> 01:24:19,319
people literally exhaust air and bring

2232
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,179
in fresh air because that's like if the

2233
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:23,039
temperatures and outside are fine or

2234
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:24,779
whatever that's great yeah um some

2235
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:27,119
people try to do a combination of air

2236
01:24:24,779 --> 01:24:29,099
conditioners and d-hums but you're

2237
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:32,059
basically trying to keep it somewhere

2238
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:35,159
between the mid 60s to low 70s and temp

2239
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:38,039
and you know somewhere between ideally

2240
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:40,619
60 humidity but don't panic if it's 65

2241
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:43,619
or 70 or even 75 four or five for the

2242
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:45,899
first day or two it should come down but

2243
01:24:43,619 --> 01:24:48,479
if it doesn't that first day there's so

2244
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:50,039
much moisture yeah and depending on how

2245
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:52,319
much vegetative material in a small

2246
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:54,719
space it could be insane like you were

2247
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,158
saying yeah I mean it's it's people are

2248
01:24:54,719 --> 01:25:00,060
talking about dipping it hydrogen

2249
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:01,920
peroxide yeah uh don't do that

2250
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,860
um people are doing that because they're

2251
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:06,719
trying to pass testing with various PM

2252
01:25:04,859 --> 01:25:10,979
or Biologicals or different stuff like

2253
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:14,359
that hydrogen peroxide is um uh is a uh

2254
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:14,359
it oxidizes

2255
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:20,760
various Terps it's going to oxidize

2256
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:22,320
various compounds it's going to it's

2257
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:24,360
going to lower the quality of your weed

2258
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:27,179
you know yeah

2259
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:28,559
um so so there's an aspect of and look I

2260
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:30,060
mean these are just like people can hit

2261
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,800
me up later these are just like basic

2262
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,659
things it's actually kind of hard to

2263
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,940
just walk through like all the little

2264
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:37,259
details of how you would do it yeah but

2265
01:25:35,939 --> 01:25:38,939
essentially I'm just trying to give you

2266
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:41,100
like a range whatever your equipment

2267
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:42,658
might be some people might be able to

2268
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:45,239
use outside air some people might be

2269
01:25:42,658 --> 01:25:47,399
able to use dehumidifiers and air

2270
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:49,139
conditioners maybe even dehumidifiers

2271
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:51,119
and heaters depending on where they live

2272
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,440
and what time of year it is but you're

2273
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:55,198
just trying to keep the plant in that

2274
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:56,879
range and after three or four days

2275
01:25:55,198 --> 01:26:00,079
your plan is going to shrink a bunch

2276
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:02,340
yeah right and once it shrinks a bunch

2277
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:03,899
then you're in a mode where you're going

2278
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,520
to start to see

2279
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:08,279
um most of that water is gone and it

2280
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:11,219
should be a lot easier for you to

2281
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:13,198
moderate your drying room yeah right

2282
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:14,520
like as long as as long as you have the

2283
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:16,439
equipment in place that's going to make

2284
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:19,620
it work right you're not really battling

2285
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:20,819
in that middle section yeah right so

2286
01:26:19,619 --> 01:26:23,039
you're just trying to keep it at those

2287
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:25,139
same temps and now another three or four

2288
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:26,519
days passes right

2289
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:28,679
and

2290
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,179
now you're in the third stage stage of

2291
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:32,340
drawing which is actually kind of weird

2292
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:33,199
because you risk your plants getting too

2293
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:35,699
dry

2294
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:38,219
but if you take them down often after

2295
01:26:35,698 --> 01:26:40,019
six or seven days they're still got too

2296
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:41,760
much moisture in the stem and you try to

2297
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:44,219
bin them up or bag them up and that

2298
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,579
sweats right out yeah it's a lot more

2299
01:26:44,219 --> 01:26:50,039
work yeah right so I like to go 10 or 14

2300
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:51,840
days on the line yeah if I'm doing it

2301
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:53,279
commercially it's usually 10 or 12 of

2302
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,460
them doing it for myself it's usually

2303
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:58,979
more like 14. you know but you might

2304
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:01,980
actually have I have humidifiers

2305
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:04,439
uh where sometimes I add moisture bad

2306
01:27:01,979 --> 01:27:05,939
back into my room yeah sometimes it

2307
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:07,439
might be fall and it might have not

2308
01:27:05,939 --> 01:27:10,678
rained in months and it might be bone

2309
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:12,779
dry and 20 humidity outside and your AC

2310
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:14,399
is removing some moisture and so is your

2311
01:27:12,779 --> 01:27:17,399
whatever sometimes you turn off all your

2312
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:19,379
D humps yeah right sometimes you turn

2313
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:20,759
off your fans

2314
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:23,579
um and because you're just trying to

2315
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,719
conserve that moisture sometimes and

2316
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:27,119
you're just trying to get through that

2317
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:29,520
next three or four days to let the

2318
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:32,760
chlorophyll on the moisture slowly sweat

2319
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,380
out yeah and if it's too dry your stuff

2320
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,719
will start to get crisp

2321
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:38,219
yeah right so you're going low and slow

2322
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,198
some people just want to say just leave

2323
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:42,239
it at 60 and 60 like the jungle boys or

2324
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:43,559
some [ __ ] and you just like Let It Be I

2325
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:45,779
don't actually I think that there's like

2326
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:47,219
three distinct stages and if you treat

2327
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:50,039
them different it's a little easier to

2328
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:52,439
deal with well 60 60 can't work for all

2329
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:54,359
types of Bud densities either like I

2330
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:56,099
mean you've got to be some range there's

2331
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:57,960
a lot of CopyCat stuff in there so I'm

2332
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,639
just kind of trying to give generals and

2333
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,100
maybe I'm talking fast because it's kind

2334
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:03,600
of a big subject or whatever but and if

2335
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,340
you have if you have the right

2336
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,780
environment

2337
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:09,420
um if you have the right environment

2338
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:11,939
like you can actually you could you can

2339
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:13,800
keep it three weeks four weeks you know

2340
01:28:11,939 --> 01:28:15,779
it's not like yeah you know you can

2341
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,820
actually I mean with the right outside

2342
01:28:15,779 --> 01:28:19,920
and the right inside you can leave it up

2343
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:21,658
there for a while if you wanted to I

2344
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,000
don't tend to like to because I often

2345
01:28:21,658 --> 01:28:25,920
have to refill it or I just find that

2346
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,319
the next stage I can actually get a lot

2347
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:31,199
more control doing it what I do next so

2348
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:33,238
this is where a lot of people [ __ ] it up

2349
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:34,319
in my opinion right here right I don't

2350
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:36,299
think I've like talked about anything

2351
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,559
too revolutionary yet or any [ __ ] like

2352
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:40,199
no no

2353
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:42,239
um but here's where it's a mess is that

2354
01:28:40,198 --> 01:28:45,779
there's an aspect where

2355
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:47,459
after 10 or 11 days like people tend to

2356
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:49,679
think that they need to store their weed

2357
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,639
at a consistency that's perfect for

2358
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,679
smoke

2359
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,819
yeah and you actually probably don't

2360
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:55,560
want to store it at that you probably

2361
01:28:53,819 --> 01:28:58,920
want to store it like a little bit too

2362
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:02,219
moist yeah for smoke right and so what

2363
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:04,440
you what I end up doing is at that point

2364
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:06,600
like I think that's where the Cure

2365
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:09,719
begins right and a lot of people think

2366
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:12,659
you cure in jars you actually cure on

2367
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:14,520
the stem okay if you take it off the

2368
01:29:12,658 --> 01:29:18,599
stem you're not curing

2369
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:20,280
okay why is that because most curing and

2370
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,600
like if you talk to Tobacco farmer

2371
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:23,399
people or whatever like they'll talk

2372
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,020
about this all day or you know yeah they

2373
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:27,420
grow tobacco for cigars or different

2374
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:30,420
things there's an interplay between the

2375
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:31,260
stem and the leaf yeah the stem and the

2376
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,359
flower

2377
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:35,820
right and the plant can if as long as

2378
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:39,179
it's all connected the plant can move

2379
01:29:35,819 --> 01:29:42,960
that moisture around itself yeah right

2380
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:45,359
so what I tend to do is that when it

2381
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:48,480
comes time I will take like a bunch of

2382
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:51,359
like uh literally like a store like

2383
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:53,279
grocery style paper bags yeah and you

2384
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,079
open it up and at that point

2385
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:57,359
you got to feel when you're about to

2386
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:59,899
seal something up you gotta think like

2387
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:02,039
you know how like osmosis and like like

2388
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:04,738
Aromas and moisture and all that will

2389
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:06,960
try to equalize yeah so at that point

2390
01:30:04,738 --> 01:30:08,519
I've got a bunch of fan leaves and this

2391
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,920
somebody was mentioning earlier when you

2392
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:12,780
do it that way bucking is a [ __ ] it is

2393
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,639
when you Buck

2394
01:30:12,779 --> 01:30:17,039
um before I put my stuff in there I take

2395
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:20,520
most of the No No Sweet Leaf but I take

2396
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:23,880
most of the big leaf off yeah and then I

2397
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:25,500
chop it into chunks that fit into like

2398
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:27,060
the I'm not holding my hands open the

2399
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:29,520
right way but I chop it into chunks that

2400
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:31,320
fit into the paper bag yeah you know so

2401
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,239
think about how long a paper bag is and

2402
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:35,219
they're about that size yeah and then

2403
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:37,319
you start stacking it with things that

2404
01:30:35,219 --> 01:30:39,658
have Mo not all but most of the family's

2405
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:42,420
removed yeah and left on the stem but

2406
01:30:39,658 --> 01:30:44,579
chopped into chunks that fit yeah and

2407
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:47,399
then that that bin can you that that

2408
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:50,698
paper bag can usually hold between I

2409
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:54,119
don't know 400 and 600 700 grams okay

2410
01:30:50,698 --> 01:30:56,158
okay so then you fold it over

2411
01:30:54,119 --> 01:30:57,840
right and you put it into a contractor

2412
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:00,599
bag

2413
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:03,000
now this might not sound too crazy but

2414
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:05,039
what it does is that you then fill that

2415
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,139
contractor bag with say depending on how

2416
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,519
tall the contractor is like six or nine

2417
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:11,819
backs

2418
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:13,320
okay okay and so here's here's where a

2419
01:31:11,819 --> 01:31:16,679
bunch of people [ __ ] it up in my opinion

2420
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:18,779
right is that it is most people when

2421
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:22,020
they take it down off the line they just

2422
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:24,539
throw it as is into a into a plastic bin

2423
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:26,520
yeah build the band shut the bin that's

2424
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:28,679
a super common way right well the reason

2425
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:30,600
why I don't like that is because what

2426
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:32,639
happens is you have all that extra stem

2427
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,539
and you have all that extra fan Leaf

2428
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:37,380
right

2429
01:31:33,539 --> 01:31:40,500
yeah and that [ __ ] smells like hay

2430
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:42,539
yeah it really does that's the stuff

2431
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,880
that smells like chlorophyll that's the

2432
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:46,439
stuff that smells green that's the stuff

2433
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,000
that has all the Aromas that you don't

2434
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:50,039
want and when you put

2435
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,439
a bunch of weed or anything into a

2436
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:55,198
sealed container a lot of times all that

2437
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:57,119
Aroma tries to equalize itself yeah so

2438
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:58,319
you're gonna send that Aroma all the way

2439
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:02,219
through your week

2440
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:04,619
yeah right so by picking off most of the

2441
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:06,539
big families and then by chopping the

2442
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:08,039
excess stem off and just leaving it on

2443
01:32:06,539 --> 01:32:10,500
stem chunks that are big enough to fit

2444
01:32:08,039 --> 01:32:12,300
in the bag you remove most of that and

2445
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:15,539
so the vast majority of what's in that

2446
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:18,119
paper bag is either Sweet Leaf or flour

2447
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:21,420
yeah with some Associated stem right

2448
01:32:18,119 --> 01:32:22,979
yeah and then you fill that thing up and

2449
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:25,079
you turn it over and you put it in there

2450
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:27,359
okay so here's where it's also different

2451
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:30,420
than bintech

2452
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:32,698
yeah right in a bin most people use like

2453
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:35,460
the black and yellow totes right yeah

2454
01:32:32,698 --> 01:32:37,979
they're like 25 or 30 gallons okay yeah

2455
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:39,600
so you fill one of those up and you put

2456
01:32:37,979 --> 01:32:40,799
a lid on and there's nowhere for it to

2457
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,139
breathe

2458
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,840
and it's two feet of cannabis weighing

2459
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:48,960
down on the bottom yeah so what is that

2460
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,360
bot what is that bottom third like

2461
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,100
it's got weight pushing down it's gonna

2462
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:57,059
be moisture pushing down on it there's

2463
01:32:53,100 --> 01:33:00,000
nowhere for it to breathe right so if

2464
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:01,440
you put like six or nine paper bags into

2465
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,939
a contractor

2466
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:06,599
go ahead

2467
01:33:02,939 --> 01:33:07,559
um they uh they stop they hold their

2468
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,659
shape

2469
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:11,400
yep right

2470
01:33:09,658 --> 01:33:13,439
they hold their shape

2471
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:15,599
so you never have

2472
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:18,119
a few thousand grams weighing down on

2473
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,159
the bottom yeah there is there you know

2474
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:22,679
what I'm saying yeah you know because

2475
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:24,899
they stack and that paper holds its

2476
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:26,039
shape and the paper Okay

2477
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:29,939
um

2478
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:33,779
the paper actually is porous

2479
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:35,519
yes it's not like a bin so instead of a

2480
01:33:33,779 --> 01:33:38,759
bin where you have two or three or four

2481
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:40,739
pounds you know of of weed stuffed into

2482
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:43,320
a bin and then sealed and there's no

2483
01:33:40,738 --> 01:33:46,379
breathability yeah all those bags get to

2484
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:48,299
breathe yeah and that breathing is what

2485
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:49,679
brings the moisture slowly from the

2486
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,760
center to the outside

2487
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:54,119
okay

2488
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:57,900
right so then you can you can put it in

2489
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:59,279
there right and and you can tie it off

2490
01:33:57,899 --> 01:34:01,920
and if you did it just the right way

2491
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:03,479
it'll stay stable like that for straight

2492
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,500
up weeks to months

2493
01:34:03,479 --> 01:34:09,059
oh yeah 100 okay and I've done I've done

2494
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:11,100
like experiments with friends or

2495
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:13,320
whatever where like you know you trim

2496
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:15,420
some up within a few weeks

2497
01:34:13,319 --> 01:34:17,698
yeah and two months later you go back

2498
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:19,800
and all the stuff that was still in the

2499
01:34:17,698 --> 01:34:21,960
paper bags has a bunch of Terps

2500
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:24,300
yeah where where the stuff that got

2501
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:27,119
trimmed and started to oxidize

2502
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:29,340
right and so there's an aspect there

2503
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:31,019
where the reason why we came to this is

2504
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:34,079
that for one you don't end up with a

2505
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:36,540
million bins that reek that you have to

2506
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:38,880
sterilize and clean all the time you end

2507
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:41,100
up with like super light contractor bags

2508
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,139
and paper bags yeah and let's say you

2509
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:44,699
seal up the contractor bag and it like

2510
01:34:43,139 --> 01:34:46,020
you open it up and you [ __ ] up and you

2511
01:34:44,698 --> 01:34:48,960
were a little too fast and it's a little

2512
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:51,719
too moist right you can then just open

2513
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,779
and leave the contractor bag open yeah

2514
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:57,000
right then if it's if you really [ __ ]

2515
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:58,259
up you might have to take those bags out

2516
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,899
of the contractor

2517
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:02,520
yeah but then they all breathe yeah so

2518
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:04,319
you can open them up

2519
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,880
right and then if you really messed up

2520
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:07,979
and you were too aggressive about it and

2521
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:10,199
you feel down there and it feels wet and

2522
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:13,979
damp and uncomfortable right yeah you

2523
01:35:10,198 --> 01:35:15,658
can actually take an empty paper bag and

2524
01:35:13,979 --> 01:35:18,779
your full one and you can dump it in

2525
01:35:15,658 --> 01:35:20,039
there and now the bottom is the top yeah

2526
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:22,500
right

2527
01:35:20,039 --> 01:35:24,300
you just fluffed it essentially and you

2528
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:26,639
can do that one by one to all of them

2529
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:28,139
that's only if you screw up and you

2530
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:29,880
realize that after you've sealed it up

2531
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:31,440
for a day it's not as stable as you want

2532
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,539
it to be there was too much moisture in

2533
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:34,919
there and it actually got re-wet yeah

2534
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:36,420
when you get it to the moisture level

2535
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:38,520
you want you can seal it back up and you

2536
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:40,500
can put it in there and

2537
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:43,139
you know I've had a situation where like

2538
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:45,600
a lot of times in outdoor season in the

2539
01:35:43,139 --> 01:35:47,400
fall it took us quite a while to get

2540
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,739
through all the work

2541
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:51,839
yeah so you had to store it in such a

2542
01:35:49,738 --> 01:35:53,698
way that you could

2543
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:55,560
um you know you you would you would keep

2544
01:35:53,698 --> 01:35:58,738
the quality

2545
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:00,360
yeah and that definitely uh made it all

2546
01:35:58,738 --> 01:36:02,638
the way to our parties and [ __ ] because

2547
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:04,859
I remember smoking that you know after

2548
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:07,440
fact and it was still just amazing oh

2549
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:09,599
that first year especially yeah pip and

2550
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:11,698
myself and and home you know the friends

2551
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,739
like we went and all that weed in those

2552
01:36:11,698 --> 01:36:16,019
in those bags and jars we pulled out of

2553
01:36:13,738 --> 01:36:17,579
that's why most of it was on trimmed you

2554
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:19,380
know or partially trimmed we just pulled

2555
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:20,760
it out of the bags just like that Tech

2556
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:23,159
and it had been sitting in there for two

2557
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,500
months yeah and most of our close

2558
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:27,238
friends to be perfectly honest uh in

2559
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:28,619
Even in our Circle and our Discord and

2560
01:36:27,238 --> 01:36:31,379
stuff like that that have tried this

2561
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:33,059
method keep using it there's ways you

2562
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:35,159
can refine it I kind of skimmed over

2563
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:36,719
certain parts but because there's depth

2564
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:40,319
and there's things that can come up but

2565
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:42,899
as far as like a modular small the

2566
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:45,238
large-scale way right

2567
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:47,579
um a lot of times people they talk about

2568
01:36:45,238 --> 01:36:49,859
curing in Turkey bags or curing in the

2569
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:52,619
jar you're actually not really curing

2570
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:54,420
your fermenting yes yeah you're

2571
01:36:52,619 --> 01:36:58,198
exchanging gas when people talk about

2572
01:36:54,420 --> 01:37:01,199
burping that's not actually caring

2573
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:02,879
you know what makes it fermenting as

2574
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:05,399
opposed to curing

2575
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,960
there's this one I mean it's like I

2576
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:08,399
don't wanna I don't want to misspeak and

2577
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:11,399
have somebody jump in that knows more

2578
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:13,319
than me about it but but in general what

2579
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:15,119
it boils down to is there's some acts

2580
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:17,939
there's some interplay

2581
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:20,279
between each of the flowers being

2582
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:22,259
connected to the stem

2583
01:37:20,279 --> 01:37:24,179
yeah that doesn't mean you can't put it

2584
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:27,119
in a jar and it improves over the first

2585
01:37:24,179 --> 01:37:28,980
few weeks in the jar too I'm just saying

2586
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:30,899
that like a lot of times people think

2587
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:33,658
they remove it from all they removed it

2588
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:36,539
from the stem way too fast yeah and like

2589
01:37:33,658 --> 01:37:39,179
if you let that that few weeks I I would

2590
01:37:36,539 --> 01:37:40,800
even tell people like once you put it in

2591
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:43,079
that contractor just leave it alone for

2592
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,179
a week yeah leave it alone for 10 days

2593
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:47,399
and then go back to it and then trim it

2594
01:37:45,179 --> 01:37:49,619
and we've had we've had a bunch of

2595
01:37:47,399 --> 01:37:52,019
friends that have tried it right and

2596
01:37:49,619 --> 01:37:53,460
they all keep using it yeah and they all

2597
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:56,159
feel like it improved their personal

2598
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:57,840
smoke yeah yeah

2599
01:37:56,158 --> 01:38:00,179
right we'll dig it that's why I wanted

2600
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,100
you to tell it it's important so so yeah

2601
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:04,199
there's an aspect and there's there's

2602
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:05,760
there's parts of it where you know like

2603
01:38:04,198 --> 01:38:07,138
like I said I glossed over certain

2604
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,579
things because it's kind of long and

2605
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:11,039
involved and you could ask a bunch of

2606
01:38:08,579 --> 01:38:13,380
detailed questions and stuff that went

2607
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:16,439
on and I wasn't trying to like drown

2608
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:17,819
people and uh but anybody can reach out

2609
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:20,279
about it because I want people to have

2610
01:38:17,819 --> 01:38:22,519
better weed and there it is true low and

2611
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:25,439
slow but I definitely think there's

2612
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:28,199
drying and there's curing and then

2613
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:30,359
there's jarring and a lot of people just

2614
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:33,238
dry and jar

2615
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:35,099
yeah and they miss that middle part

2616
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:36,599
yep that doesn't mean your weed's not

2617
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:39,840
good I'm not dissing your weed I'm just

2618
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:41,699
saying that like I've found you know for

2619
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,579
a lot of the things that I grow that I

2620
01:38:41,698 --> 01:38:46,678
get better flavor profiles when you give

2621
01:38:44,579 --> 01:38:49,380
that plant a week or 10 days or two

2622
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:51,239
weeks to interplay between the stem and

2623
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:54,600
the flower and back and forth and all

2624
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:57,959
that and cure in a big pile into itself

2625
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:00,539
yeah you know because back in the day

2626
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:02,520
when things moved really fast

2627
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:04,619
um a lot of times people would I just

2628
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,600
smoke some in New York people would uh

2629
01:39:04,619 --> 01:39:08,819
they would just dry weed as fast as they

2630
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,139
could get it to Market yep and it would

2631
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:12,420
have a little bit of that chlorophyll

2632
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:14,159
Tang I had somebody try to tell me it

2633
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:15,779
was like they they only smoke it like

2634
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:17,339
that because after two weeks the live

2635
01:39:15,779 --> 01:39:20,880
terpenes fade

2636
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:22,440
oh okay yeah and I was like yeah I've

2637
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,539
smoked plenty of weed that was dried

2638
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:27,119
fast for commercial purposes I get it

2639
01:39:24,539 --> 01:39:30,179
you know like yeah yeah

2640
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:31,619
you know and so yeah people can be you

2641
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:33,960
know they're yeah most people skip

2642
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:36,539
curing they go from right from drying

2643
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,819
you know right from drying to jarring

2644
01:39:36,539 --> 01:39:41,880
right from jarring right from drying to

2645
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:43,619
packaging you know yeah and uh and this

2646
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:45,119
Tech it's like it's really easy it's all

2647
01:39:43,619 --> 01:39:46,859
that stuff is really available it's

2648
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:49,198
nothing special it doesn't take up a ton

2649
01:39:46,859 --> 01:39:52,079
of space in your house you can condense

2650
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:53,759
you can reuse the the paper bags

2651
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:55,859
multiple times if you treat them right

2652
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,780
you know you can shove a ton of them

2653
01:39:55,859 --> 01:39:59,339
into one or two contractors it's light

2654
01:39:57,779 --> 01:40:02,579
as a feather

2655
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:04,980
you know it's modular it's easy it can

2656
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:07,319
fit in a closet it can fit in a garage

2657
01:40:04,979 --> 01:40:09,959
it can they can stack on top of each

2658
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:12,000
other because and and there's one thing

2659
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,439
like and you pointed out sometimes you

2660
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,060
might need to fluff it but it's okay

2661
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:17,460
because not so it's a professional

2662
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:19,920
fluffer

2663
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:22,619
yeah indeed I've been trying to get that

2664
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:24,000
joke in for like five minutes sometimes

2665
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:25,920
you need to go sometimes you need to

2666
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,960
make you know from bottom to top you

2667
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,100
need to really just change up what's

2668
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,300
going on

2669
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:31,620
um and you know that's the thing is it's

2670
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,179
like when you do it perfect you don't

2671
01:40:31,619 --> 01:40:35,698
have to do any of that I just wanted to

2672
01:40:33,179 --> 01:40:37,139
go through like because it is weird and

2673
01:40:35,698 --> 01:40:38,698
we have close friends of ours that when

2674
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:40,500
we first when I first showed them how to

2675
01:40:38,698 --> 01:40:43,259
do it they thought they were putting it

2676
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:45,000
away too wet yeah and a lot of times

2677
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,800
they don't realize that it stores really

2678
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,300
well like that

2679
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,520
um but then sometimes it does get too

2680
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:52,199
wet like it gets a little mushy or it's

2681
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:54,179
scary wet or whatever and you need to

2682
01:40:52,198 --> 01:40:57,178
let it breathe and so there's a variety

2683
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:59,520
of ways you can let it breathe and

2684
01:40:57,179 --> 01:41:01,079
um you know this is like I just don't I

2685
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,600
don't like plastic bins for a lot they

2686
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:06,000
don't breathe at all and so what happens

2687
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,940
what happens in anaerobic environments

2688
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,639
yeah yeah it just creates stale air and

2689
01:41:08,939 --> 01:41:13,379
and moisture hanging and different kinds

2690
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:15,779
of different kinds of processes happen

2691
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:17,579
in low oxygen versus higher oxygen

2692
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:19,679
environments yeah yeah

2693
01:41:17,579 --> 01:41:21,119
you know and so there's an act there's

2694
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,100
an aspect of that where it's like so

2695
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:24,599
even if you screw up a few times there's

2696
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:26,880
like various ways you can get out of

2697
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:28,260
panic mode yeah sometimes all I had to

2698
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,359
do was just open the top of my

2699
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:32,820
contractor and leave it in the living

2700
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:35,158
room for you know a night or half a day

2701
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:37,679
and all of a sudden the excess moisture

2702
01:41:35,158 --> 01:41:40,079
had breathed and escaped you know those

2703
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:42,060
paper bags are dry so like they will

2704
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:44,579
absorb a little bit of excess moisture

2705
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:48,539
without becoming damp you know so that

2706
01:41:44,579 --> 01:41:50,939
helps too uh and uh you know there's

2707
01:41:48,539 --> 01:41:52,319
there's just it just keeps the weight

2708
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:53,879
because that's what you don't want is

2709
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:57,960
you don't want

2710
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:59,400
pressure and low oxygen and you know you

2711
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,859
want things to be able to breathe you

2712
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:04,379
want things to be able to like slowly

2713
01:42:01,859 --> 01:42:06,059
take that last bit of moisture out from

2714
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:07,500
the center of the buds and from the

2715
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:09,840
center of the stems and bring it out

2716
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:11,819
into the flower yeah and I think you

2717
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,579
know your your weed Burns better

2718
01:42:11,819 --> 01:42:15,960
you know yeah your weed Burns better it

2719
01:42:14,579 --> 01:42:18,779
tastes better I've grown a lot of

2720
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:21,179
strains over a long period of time and I

2721
01:42:18,779 --> 01:42:23,219
have a lot of repeats and so you know

2722
01:42:21,179 --> 01:42:25,380
you you grow it one way for a while and

2723
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:27,118
you're like oh I killed it and you grow

2724
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:28,500
this other way and you you don't get the

2725
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:30,299
trim you don't get the dry right and

2726
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:32,039
then you're like oh I [ __ ] it up yeah

2727
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:34,020
now it's not as good now my weed that's

2728
01:42:32,039 --> 01:42:35,460
like three months old still Burns a

2729
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:37,980
little nicer than this weed that I just

2730
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:39,300
got fresh yeah and so you you know and

2731
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:41,638
then your friends do that too and then

2732
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:43,860
you have feedback loops and then you

2733
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:45,179
know and then you you go through and so

2734
01:42:43,859 --> 01:42:47,399
there's a lot of things people can get

2735
01:42:45,179 --> 01:42:49,199
all Tech and you can go to like moisture

2736
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:51,839
in the buds and higher meters I'm giving

2737
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:54,000
you like Hill Tech I'm giving you like

2738
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,340
observational Tech that's basically by

2739
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,920
experience and by feel and then you have

2740
01:42:56,340 --> 01:43:01,440
some Basic Ground rules on when not to

2741
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:02,940
panic about it yeah right

2742
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:04,319
um and you know we have a buddy too that

2743
01:43:02,939 --> 01:43:06,960
like is people were talking about

2744
01:43:04,319 --> 01:43:09,118
elevation earlier as well I mean we have

2745
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,980
a we have a good friend of ours that

2746
01:43:09,118 --> 01:43:14,698
um we worked through it

2747
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:17,698
um and he lives in very high elevation

2748
01:43:14,698 --> 01:43:20,339
um and his weed dried way too fast yeah

2749
01:43:17,698 --> 01:43:22,738
yeah way way too fast and we were able

2750
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:25,079
to really slow it down and get cures and

2751
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:26,939
he's ecstatic good

2752
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:28,618
yeah I remember so I'm not saying it's

2753
01:43:26,939 --> 01:43:29,819
like this is like the be-all end-all I'm

2754
01:43:28,618 --> 01:43:31,198
just saying that it's worked for me and

2755
01:43:29,819 --> 01:43:33,840
my friends for a long period of time

2756
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:35,279
it's an excellent way to cure we we I

2757
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,440
did bring a bunch of weed to the can

2758
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:38,698
Illuminati parties dried because the

2759
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:41,279
canned Illuminati parties were in

2760
01:43:38,698 --> 01:43:43,259
December yeah most of that weed came

2761
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:45,840
down in October or November so it was

2762
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:48,719
one to two months old yeah by the time

2763
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,699
that you guys got a hold of it yeah and

2764
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:52,079
all the weed that I brought whether it

2765
01:43:50,698 --> 01:43:53,519
was trimmed or untrimmed all went

2766
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:55,618
through that whole process

2767
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,300
yeah and I really do think it brings out

2768
01:43:55,618 --> 01:43:59,339
quality it's definitely a way to like

2769
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,139
not screw it up at the end

2770
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:02,760
wait yeah like as far as far as our

2771
01:44:01,139 --> 01:44:06,179
group goes like it seems like everybody

2772
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:08,219
kind of contributes one more some more

2773
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:09,960
than one but everybody kind of brings

2774
01:44:08,219 --> 01:44:11,760
one major thing to the table and when I

2775
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:13,079
think of not so his drying Tech is the

2776
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,000
one thing I think he's brought to the

2777
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:17,639
table that's changed it for our group as

2778
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,198
a whole so that's why I wanted uh to

2779
01:44:17,639 --> 01:44:21,480
bring it up because this is a lot of

2780
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:23,698
skilled uh people in our group and and

2781
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:25,019
if if it's if it's changing their minds

2782
01:44:23,698 --> 01:44:27,299
it might be something that other people

2783
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:29,159
are into too yeah and there's and you

2784
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:30,600
know there's there's there's patterns to

2785
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:33,539
it or whatever and there's ways you can

2786
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:34,860
adapt it here and there and so there's I

2787
01:44:33,539 --> 01:44:37,079
don't know I just I've just found it to

2788
01:44:34,859 --> 01:44:38,519
be really flexible and I haven't found

2789
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:40,859
anything that gives me better quality

2790
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:42,360
weed it's not done at all on the

2791
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:44,460
commercial market and I think the

2792
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:47,579
commercial Market suffers for it

2793
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:50,399
you know uh the the whole curing aspect

2794
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:52,380
and the whole treating it nice for a bit

2795
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:53,579
um that seems to be you know shoved away

2796
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:55,618
to efficiency

2797
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:57,479
yeah and then if you the problem is if

2798
01:44:55,618 --> 01:44:59,279
you mess it up you can always rehydrate

2799
01:44:57,479 --> 01:45:01,500
weed but it's never the same as if you

2800
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,960
dried it low and slow and got it sticky

2801
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:06,000
if you can get it a certain stickiness

2802
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:07,679
and a certain ratio

2803
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,899
um it can stay good like that for a

2804
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:11,819
really long time and if you get it

2805
01:45:09,899 --> 01:45:14,158
overly dry which a lot of people used to

2806
01:45:11,819 --> 01:45:17,279
do and then they'd re-moisten for sale

2807
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:19,799
it'll be all right for a week or two but

2808
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:23,460
not that long no and then it'll go back

2809
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:25,079
to being a a lot a lot blander yeah you

2810
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:28,079
know so if you do it the right way you

2811
01:45:25,079 --> 01:45:30,658
can get like a a weird sponginess

2812
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:33,179
that has enough give to have some

2813
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:35,879
moisture in it and but enough you know

2814
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:38,340
but it but it's it's really well cured

2815
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:40,679
yeah and and not so much that it just

2816
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:42,779
goes poof in your hand yeah if you hear

2817
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:43,920
crunching that's not that great you

2818
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:45,899
don't want to hear a crunch you want to

2819
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,760
go you know I mean the the you know

2820
01:45:45,899 --> 01:45:50,399
it'll probably still get you high

2821
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:53,280
but a lot of delicate a lot of delicate

2822
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:55,138
terpenes orange peels in the sack all

2823
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:56,880
that [ __ ] that's all failure

2824
01:45:55,139 --> 01:45:59,159
yeah I mean I'm not saying it doesn't

2825
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,960
work don't get me wrong but I'm saying

2826
01:45:59,158 --> 01:46:03,420
like your weed is never as good if you

2827
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:05,520
have to rehydrate it yeah if you have to

2828
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:06,420
rehydrate it you didn't store it the

2829
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:09,119
right way

2830
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:10,618
yeah you know

2831
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:12,479
um you know yeah people saying this

2832
01:46:10,618 --> 01:46:14,819
didn't it didn't work at scale on his 30

2833
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:17,279
lighter that's ridiculous I mean like

2834
01:46:14,819 --> 01:46:18,960
you know uh I mean I did it with like

2835
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:21,420
when we when Mendo first went legal and

2836
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:23,399
we were allowed 10 000 square feet yeah

2837
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:24,480
which is far larger than a 30 lighter

2838
01:46:23,399 --> 01:46:26,939
you know

2839
01:46:24,479 --> 01:46:28,799
um yeah small by today's standards right

2840
01:46:26,939 --> 01:46:31,138
now but still

2841
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:33,480
um you know it's it's a chunk of pounds

2842
01:46:31,139 --> 01:46:35,340
yeah so it works you know

2843
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:37,559
um and then on top of this too it's

2844
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:38,940
really easy to do this at a small scale

2845
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,560
for everybody that's just trying to

2846
01:46:38,939 --> 01:46:43,198
smoke better wheat

2847
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,940
yeah totally you know if you might only

2848
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:46,979
have you might only have one or two or

2849
01:46:44,939 --> 01:46:48,779
three contractors or something

2850
01:46:46,979 --> 01:46:50,218
you know if you're just growing for your

2851
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:52,079
personal smoke and it's for you or

2852
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:54,539
whatever like then it's really easy to

2853
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:56,639
like baby it and then you'll really see

2854
01:46:54,539 --> 01:46:57,899
yeah for sure you know and there might

2855
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,279
be a time too when people want to

2856
01:46:57,899 --> 01:47:01,500
experiment with it or whatever where

2857
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:03,000
like they get to a point where

2858
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,979
um you know you might end up like if

2859
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,260
especially if it's just for you you

2860
01:47:04,979 --> 01:47:09,718
might end up like trimming some and then

2861
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:11,699
leave half the bag cured and super nice

2862
01:47:09,719 --> 01:47:13,618
in a cool spot that's dry

2863
01:47:11,698 --> 01:47:15,178
yeah and go check on your weed a month

2864
01:47:13,618 --> 01:47:17,099
later and see if you like the wheat in

2865
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:20,340
your jar better or see if you like the

2866
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:22,079
the flour you just broke off the branch

2867
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:23,400
and hold the joint with you might be

2868
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:26,100
surprised

2869
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:27,420
yeah I know I know Bodhi has this

2870
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:29,639
perfect room

2871
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:31,920
um or did at his house that was like a

2872
01:47:29,639 --> 01:47:33,840
humidor and because where he lived is

2873
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,158
just that perfect oh yeah I know he said

2874
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,300
he's there's some weed in there from

2875
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:40,019
like

2876
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:42,480
a long time years yeah and and it's all

2877
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:45,000
hanging and it's on the branch and you

2878
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:47,698
know like I've noticed even with seeds

2879
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,020
like if they're stored in their Bud they

2880
01:47:47,698 --> 01:47:51,658
last longer it's like a natural

2881
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:53,400
protection for it so you know I think

2882
01:47:51,658 --> 01:47:54,960
there's a lot of good aspects even if

2883
01:47:53,399 --> 01:47:56,519
you're just making seeds and drying

2884
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,698
seeds there's a lot of good aspects to

2885
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:00,840
keeping it under pressure

2886
01:47:58,698 --> 01:48:05,099
bury our seed

2887
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:07,319
in um in uh 55 gallon drums and it would

2888
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:10,199
all be on the cola yeah you wouldn't

2889
01:48:07,319 --> 01:48:12,779
deseed it you would store it you know on

2890
01:48:10,198 --> 01:48:14,698
a dry Cola yeah it makes it great it

2891
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:16,380
makes great storage makes great storage

2892
01:48:14,698 --> 01:48:18,059
they're not they're not rubbing up

2893
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:20,639
against each other I mean a lot of

2894
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:22,080
people don't know this right but uh you

2895
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,600
know Caleb and I were just talking about

2896
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:27,118
it we're like that tiger stripe rubs off

2897
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:29,760
oh yeah it's it's a thin layer it's not

2898
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:33,118
an it's it's more like a super thin

2899
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:36,060
tight fitting skin shell than it is like

2900
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:38,039
an embossed feature of a hard shell so

2901
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:40,260
if you people that start people that

2902
01:48:38,039 --> 01:48:41,819
like hand Harvest their seeds and all

2903
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:43,739
that and they treat them really lightly

2904
01:48:41,819 --> 01:48:45,179
they could end up getting all these dark

2905
01:48:43,738 --> 01:48:47,519
tiger stripes you start putting them

2906
01:48:45,179 --> 01:48:49,739
through like a blower and sifting them

2907
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:51,360
really nice and doing all this extra

2908
01:48:49,738 --> 01:48:53,099
work to make sure people get perfect

2909
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:54,719
seeds and all of a sudden you could end

2910
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:57,179
up with some pale seeds that were dark

2911
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:59,039
before yeah because they lost their

2912
01:48:57,179 --> 01:49:02,760
tiger stripe because it just frictioned

2913
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:05,579
off it's a thin almost transparent skin

2914
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:08,219
with dark stripes so yeah I watched it

2915
01:49:05,579 --> 01:49:10,079
come off seeds constantly yeah and a lot

2916
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:13,020
of us use blowers that make a lot of

2917
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:14,579
seed so yeah it was interesting is I was

2918
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:16,920
actually just talking the last few weeks

2919
01:49:14,579 --> 01:49:18,600
to uh to a Jamaican who was telling me

2920
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:20,219
about how they store seeds and they

2921
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:23,639
can't bury them they store them in in

2922
01:49:20,219 --> 01:49:25,679
big 55 gallon drums in Jamaica and they

2923
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:27,800
store them basically either on bud or in

2924
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:30,179
the shake

2925
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:33,300
because it acts like a natural

2926
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:36,000
insulation and protects it from the Heat

2927
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:39,300
and it works wait they'd rather have a

2928
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:41,698
big drum full of shake and Seed than a

2929
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:43,380
big or you know Buds and Seed then a big

2930
01:49:41,698 --> 01:49:46,738
thing just full of seed

2931
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:48,719
because it'll die someone asked is it a

2932
01:49:46,738 --> 01:49:50,459
more Indica trait tiger stripes I've

2933
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:51,719
noticed it a lot in afghanis and and

2934
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:54,600
things the bigger seeds that I see

2935
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:56,460
typically from afghanis but it's not a a

2936
01:49:54,600 --> 01:50:00,060
general trait you can apply like that

2937
01:49:56,460 --> 01:50:01,500
one of the but never mind go on no as

2938
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:03,420
you can say a lot of the land race like

2939
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:06,479
Africans and and Malawi's they tend to

2940
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:09,139
be smaller black seeds yeah it also

2941
01:50:06,479 --> 01:50:13,678
depends on what the mother was

2942
01:50:09,139 --> 01:50:15,719
right so um you know you uh if you're

2943
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:18,600
you know if your seeds are forming in

2944
01:50:15,719 --> 01:50:20,520
some kind of Equatorial sativa they're

2945
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:22,860
going to tend to be smaller because the

2946
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:24,780
flower clusters and the calyxes they're

2947
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:26,339
forming in are also small

2948
01:50:24,779 --> 01:50:27,960
yeah and it depends on when it's

2949
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:29,579
pollinated and where on the plant it's

2950
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,960
pollinated how big the seed there's so

2951
01:50:29,579 --> 01:50:33,779
many things that go into factors but

2952
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:37,800
like the tiger striping you don't see it

2953
01:50:33,779 --> 01:50:39,479
a ton in traditional land race uh narrow

2954
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:41,579
leaf plants and there was an aspect

2955
01:50:39,479 --> 01:50:43,738
where there was for a long time there

2956
01:50:41,579 --> 01:50:46,198
was a misnomer among the community where

2957
01:50:43,738 --> 01:50:47,698
you know if it wasn't tiger striped

2958
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:49,439
enough that means you didn't let it go

2959
01:50:47,698 --> 01:50:52,738
to full maturity and you were trying to

2960
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:55,500
sell young or immature seeds or you were

2961
01:50:52,738 --> 01:50:56,939
trying to cheat a bit or whatever

2962
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:58,979
um and so there's a thing with seeds

2963
01:50:56,939 --> 01:51:01,138
where people are very visual

2964
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:02,519
yeah and you know we have you know we

2965
01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:05,039
have friends or whatever that like won't

2966
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:07,880
sell the pale ones even though they get

2967
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:10,319
crazy germ rates on them yeah I I've

2968
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:12,779
kept a lot of lines off the market that

2969
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:14,340
were just light or lost their stripes in

2970
01:51:12,779 --> 01:51:16,259
the blower they just kept them off the

2971
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:18,060
market because I knew it'd be more of a

2972
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:20,219
pain in the ass to explain all that and

2973
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:21,539
teach every single person than to do

2974
01:51:20,219 --> 01:51:24,840
that

2975
01:51:21,539 --> 01:51:26,880
oh my God color-coded seeds uh if you go

2976
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:28,619
to if you go to greenhouse's site on

2977
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:30,539
their accomplishments the color-coded

2978
01:51:28,618 --> 01:51:33,000
seeds is one of the top

2979
01:51:30,539 --> 01:51:35,819
I don't go to greenhouse's site although

2980
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,319
I will say I did before I before I

2981
01:51:35,819 --> 01:51:40,920
dissed them too hard that when I was

2982
01:51:37,319 --> 01:51:42,479
traveling in the 90s to Holland a bunch

2983
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:44,340
um they had a great coffee shop in the

2984
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:46,559
90s yeah

2985
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:48,119
I mean I I started talking [ __ ] about

2986
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,880
greenhouse and all of a sudden I was

2987
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:53,219
banned from the internet yeah that was

2988
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,679
crazy so let's finish it up we're right

2989
01:51:53,219 --> 01:51:57,239
there at the two hours I saw you I kept

2990
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:59,039
trying to join but it kept telling me to

2991
01:51:57,238 --> 01:52:01,138
[ __ ] off so yeah it didn't I don't know

2992
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:03,319
what the deal is but yeah I mean uh

2993
01:52:01,139 --> 01:52:06,359
before I uh maybe it'll cut me off again

2994
01:52:03,319 --> 01:52:09,359
I uh I did enjoy my time going to

2995
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:12,899
Greenhouse uh I did like it when Shanti

2996
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:15,420
and Neville sold seeds and weed there

2997
01:52:12,899 --> 01:52:17,759
um I you know I don't really appreciate

2998
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:19,380
what happened after or whatever but

2999
