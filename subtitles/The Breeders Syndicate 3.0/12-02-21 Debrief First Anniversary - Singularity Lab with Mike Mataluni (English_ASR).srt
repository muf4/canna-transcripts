1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,560
chris

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,278
and just for just for further context so

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:10,718
you actually and so lou elizondo came

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:15,880
out um and was uh was disappointed in

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,879
the uh i believe it's the aoi

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,519
um

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,960
and i saw tim you had you had similar

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,719
concerns do you want to you want to tee

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,679
us up for that

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,879
sure yeah yeah um

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,358
yeah

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,919
it's kind of funny you know i think

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
i i guess concerns as much as

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,480
this

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,960
we talk about not having expectations

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,799
but this is what i kind of expected

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,799
and uh you know people are wondering

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,280
what's going on like why have you got

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,479
now you've got this really broad robust

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,160
amendment but then you've got the

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,839
government you know the dod coming out

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,839
of the blue with this other

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,039
you know really watered down kind of

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
expectation what they're going to

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
achieve

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,719
and people like what the hell is going

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,840
on is it the cover-up is it the you know

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,520
whatever no it's it's it's the

29
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,600
government the government is happening

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
and you've heard me probably say this

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,198
was on twitter i may have said it last

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
time i was on your show

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,118
is people are getting a crash course on

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,560
how the government actually works

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,040
and uh

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
it's not pretty and and i hate saying

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,920
that but and i think to to some degree

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,840
you know the ufo community some of the

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
some of the more well-known researchers

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
or authors at times have done a bit of a

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,439
disservice because they've given this

42
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,239
picture that the government is capable

43
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,399
of this coordinated effort in anything

44
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,560
uh and that's not really the case uh

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
probably one of the best examples to

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
give you an

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,320
idea of what's going on here and i

48
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,679
talked to this a little bit about with

49
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,639
the guys and and girl chrissy last night

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,399

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,399

60
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,158
twitter you're dropping the ball there

61
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,280
was a

62
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,280
exceptional article done uh in you in

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,919
psychology today uh

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,080
about uap and what it could mean in

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,399
terms of new science and everything and

66
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
the author of that article was dr eric

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
hasseltime

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,840
dr hasseltine is a brilliant man he once

69
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,238
headed up uh

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,159
disney's imagineering

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,719
and then he was the

72
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,079
chief science and technology officer for

73
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,840
the office of director of national

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,719
intelligence odni

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,640
he was essentially the chief technology

76
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,959
officer for the entire intelligence

77
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,079
community so very brilliant guy for a

78
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,840
long time

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
and he wrote a great article there but

80
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
he also wrote a great book a couple

81
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,519
years ago and i loved it now i know

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,479
you're wrong it's kind of right up in my

83
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,319
alley

84
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,479
it may get too technical for some people

85
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,598
but it's called uh the spy in moscow

86
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,479
station

87
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,439
and it tells this fantastic story and if

88
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,598
you want to understand how the

89
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,598
government works it's a great insight

90
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,719
into how it works in the

91
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,639
short of the long there is a very true

92
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,439
real story of events that happened in

93
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,878
1978 the the nsa

94
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,079
discovered a

95
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,079
soviet bug inside the embassy in moscow

96
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,400
okay when i say discovered it they found

97
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,800
it they removed it they physically had

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,760
it it was an rf receiver hidden in a

99
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,560
chimney inside the embassy

100
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,239
they said that the soviets are listening

101
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,318
to all of your communications they told

102
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,120
the cia this and the state department

103
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,280
and in fact the cia had had

104
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
russian agents killed during this time

105
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
because of it

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,039
and the cia in the state department said

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
we don't believe you

108
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,079
and they had it in front of them like

109
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,519
they could have showed it to him no we

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
don't believe him

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,840
and the nsa pushed it and it was this

112
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,119
big turf war and i'm not going to get in

113
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,560
the weeds of this book but you really

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
get an idea of how it works where you're

115
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
like

116
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,040
why are they fighting this like it's

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,799
isn't everybody supposed to be on the

118
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,639
same team like why is there this

119
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
resistance here

120
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,919
into this idea that the russians are

121
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,120
spying on us and the cia was adamant

122
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,039
about it and the state department was

123
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
adam about it to the point where they

124
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,079
got a executive directive telling the

125
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,878
nsa stop mentioning it

126
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,480
stop talking about it because you know

127
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,359
we don't want people we don't believe

128
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,199
you

129
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,639
and this went on for five

130
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,600
years

131
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,639
until the nsa was eventually by

132
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,720
uh order of president reagan allowed to

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,240
go in remove a lot of the property that

134
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,919
was in the embassy found the bugs

135
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,199
discovered and said

136
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,639
they've been listening to you this whole

137
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,199
time so for five years from the point

138
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,720
they found it for five years all right

139
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
wow

140
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
there was so much resistance to this and

141
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
so much craziness and even at a point

142
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,039
when the nsa had difficulty finding

143
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,240
these bugs they they actually thought

144
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,400
that uh this maybe the cia removed them

145
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,560
so that they wouldn't find them to cause

146
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,560
friction in fact when the nsa technician

147
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,399
went to do the inventory the cia tried

148
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,839
to get him drunk and and had russian

149
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,679
prostitutes because they wanted to know

150
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,159
what he was doing there because it was

151
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,240
so compartmentalized they it was that

152
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,039
point a covert option where only the nsa

153
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
knew

154
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:11,199
now

155
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,840
picture that in perspective to uap okay

156
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,199
picture that in perspective that

157
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:19,198
now you know adversaries spying on you

158
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,280
is a real thing they all know that's a

159
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
real thing it goes on we spy on other

160
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,679
countries they spy on us but imagine the

161
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,359
resistance to the idea that the russians

162
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,038
or the soviet union was spying inside

163
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
the embassy when you had the proof of

164
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,319
evidence

165
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,560
so the us government is a sprawling

166
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,800
complex and now what you're seeing is

167
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,800
that the uap subject is not going to go

168
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,639
away per se and they're kind of

169
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,280
acknowledging it so you're going to see

170
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,840
a lot of infighting here as in who

171
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,159
controls the topic and you you that's

172
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,679
one of the things in that whole

173
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
that calls so much friction between the

174
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
cia and nsa is

175
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,839
whose job is it you know they all say

176
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
well nsa is their job isn't security so

177
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
screw them and it's like yeah but this

178
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
is going on and so you're going to see

179
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,439
this now and you're going to see this

180
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
now with this idea okay well fine if

181
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,560
you're going to make if you if you're

182
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,680
not going to let this go away and

183
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,439
somebody's going to look at it well then

184
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,038
it's our job but then you're going to

185
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,560
have other agencies that are like no

186
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,079
this is my job

187
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
others are going to say it's my job

188
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,439
because at the end of the day nobody

189
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,560
wants to get embarrassed

190
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,439
and say oh yes this is really something

191
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,800
uh

192
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,719
when it

193
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
when it could when technically it should

194
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
have been their job

195
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,918
and if nothing else i think probably one

196
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,918
of the most fascinating things for me

197
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,519
and maybe it's not as frustrating

198
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,279
because it's fascinating to me to watch

199
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,079
this process

200
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,638
is

201
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:43,359
i can't think of a more complex problem

202
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,240
to watch a government have to solve and

203
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,280
especially one like the us government

204
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,038
because it's everything is so segmented

205
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,119
and compartmentalized

206
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,478
where different agencies follow their

207
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,759
different branches they have different

208
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,879
jobs but you look at the uap subject

209
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,598
that is something that is

210
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,360
government-wide and it is a mysterious

211
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,439
problem that frankly the us government

212
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
is not equipped to handle and so it's

213
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,800
interesting to watch how are they going

214
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,959
to handle that because the dod i think a

215
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,639
lot of people when they saw that i'm not

216
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,799
going to attempt the acronym i've

217
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,120
forgotten from memory i don't want it

218
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
uh you know they they cried foul but

219
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,160
they were only going to look into

220
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,598
military ranges and ranges under

221
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,599
military control

222
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,839
well that's because by federal law the

223
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,680
department of defense only has limited

224
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,918
power they don't have the power to

225
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
operate on u.s soil except under very

226
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,000
very strict circumstances

227
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,079
so they don't have authority so then

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
goes into well some of this authority

229
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,918
bleeds into the coast guard some of this

230
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,759
bleeds into the faa some of this bleeds

231
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,878
into homeland security some of this

232
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,000
bleeds into the fbi all everyone i just

233
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,160
named all fall under different executive

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,639
branches so when the the secretary of

235
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,280
defense can't tell the fbi what to do

236
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,720
can't tell the faa what to do likewise

237
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,719
none of them can tell

238
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,440
but to comprehensively look at that

239
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,919
you've got to get all of these agencies

240
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,918
that aren't equipped to look at it they

241
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,079
don't work together as is and in many

242
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,159
instances they work against each other

243
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,918
they're in competition with each other

244
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,360
but they've got to work together to try

245
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,918
to solve that

246
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
now tackle on the fact that

247
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,680
every taboo that you can think of in

248
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,159
anything any conversation that you've

249
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,400
had about the subject with anybody who's

250
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
not from the ufo community maybe they've

251
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,918
just seen the new york times article or

252
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,839
something or or they've read it an

253
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,158
excellent and informative piece on the

254
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,718
deep reef uh and you're trying to

255
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,759
explain it to them and they're

256
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,440
they're like oh that's bs those that's

257
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,799
now imagine the government just multiply

258
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,399
that so you're going to have people that

259
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,278
are like this is bs

260
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,759
the infighting and squabbling

261
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:51,039
and even if let's say the gillibrand

262
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,120
amendment passes um who what office is

263
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,519
going to take that authority it is

264
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,839
something to really look at but i did i

265
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,159
i said that you know when i said my

266
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,560
concerns it was more of a people are

267
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,159
about to get a crash course into this

268
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,119
ufo problem

269
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,439
and then because of how robust how how

270
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
structured that amendment was

271
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
um

272
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,519
it wouldn't shock me to see not just the

273
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
dod but you're going to see all these

274
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,399
other people be like oh hell we're

275
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,839
starting one too because we're not going

276
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
to be outdone and everybody's going to

277
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,080
try to muscle in this and it's going to

278
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
end up in this really interesting

279
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
dynamic

280
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,278
where a year ago

281
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,599
people were upset because the government

282
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,278
wasn't taking the topic seriously at all

283
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,959
now fast forward we're upset because

284
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,039
there's too many people saying they're

285
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,039
going to look into it

286
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,799
well here here's here's my question on

287
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,719
that though and i think

288
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,479
the reason at least lately the reason

289
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,560
why people got upset is because there

290
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,440
seemed to have been

291
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:51,518
a message coming primarily from lou

292
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,800
thing this af msg office is undercutting

293
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,000
and undermining the gillibrand amendment

294
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,359
and you also compared it to um

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
you said in a tweet that it's

296
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,120
administrative terrorism

297
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,278
um and so people heard that they're like

298
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,440
what's going on and then when you dig

299
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,879
deep into it when you just simply dig

300
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
into it you find out that oh wait a

301
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,799
second

302
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,279
the dod has no jurisdiction over this

303
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,599
this bill so if this bill becomes law

304
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,679
they really can't do anything and it

305
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
seems by the statement by kathleen hicks

306
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,958
that this office that the dod is

307
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,320
creating they're doing it without

308
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,319
anyone's permission they're doing it

309
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,800
just because they can't

310
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,680
um and figure it sort of this idea of

311
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,879
well

312
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,239
they're not going to be the only ones

313
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,838
who look at this we're going to look at

314
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,480
it too

315
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,640
and so i guess my question is

316
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,480
why is this administrative terrorism if

317
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,559
this office really can't do anything to

318
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,399
if this law passes if the

319
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,838
amendment goes through which maybe we

320
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,759
find out tonight if it could have

321
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,040
happened already as we were on the show

322
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,000
um but

323
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,919
if that

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,919
can you explain a little bit as to why

325
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,078
that's sort of the feeling with with

326
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,319
this new office because

327
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,919
six months ago we would have been all

328
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,278
aboard for this we would have been

329
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,399
absolutely

330
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,399
filled with an office like this and um

331
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,159
and it seems like for me more data is

332
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,759
more data i don't care where i'm getting

333
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,799
it from if we're gonna get more data

334
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,240
from different sections of the

335
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,559
government great maybe we could paint a

336
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,000
better picture with that data um or we

337
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,759
could get at least a little bit more

338
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
clarity for the american people as to

339
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,759
what exactly we're dealing with here so

340
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
um so yeah i mean can you touch on that

341
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,000
a little bit

342
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,120
sure yeah yeah no and i i it's one of

343
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,159
those things where i said it and didn't

344
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,759
realize after and until i said it

345
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,799
people might not be familiar with the

346
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,679
term

347
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,919
yeah

348
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,838
yeah the term administrative terrorism

349
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,000
and anybody that's worked in government

350
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,399
even at the local level is very familiar

351
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,720
with that term we used it all the time

352
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,759
because administrative terrorism is just

353
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,000
that it's bureaucratic stuff that slows

354
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,000
things down you know you're getting

355
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,600
ready to run out the door to go to the

356
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,120
mall and somebody says wait wait wait

357
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,278
wait we got to inventory all of your

358
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,600
clothes and you're like what the

359
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,679
this is administrative terrorism and so

360
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,879
that term is yeah anybody who's working

361
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,958
in government has heard that term in

362
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,320
fact used it frequently so so please

363
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,759
don't take anything away from that is

364
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,120
that being uh i guess analogous with

365
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,838
terrorism

366
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,519
right right right yeah but uh but i mean

367
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
it does make it sound as if though you

368
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
know like like this is a bad thing this

369
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,879
office is not good for the topic

370
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,719
and at least that's the way it seemed it

371
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,278
seemed like that was the and that's why

372
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,800
ufo twitter sort of rallied around like

373
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,399
letting their senators know hey this

374
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,078
office isn't good enough like we need

375
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,839
more we want the gillibrand amendment to

376
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,199
make sure that that passes into into the

377
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,200
new ndaa um but it's you know you know

378
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,800
what i'm saying i just i think part of

379
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,000
there's there's a part of a little bit

380
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,000
of fear here that

381
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,200
like you want to be used to construct a

382
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
narrative or a message like that was

383
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,639
gonna be like a follow-up question in a

384
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
second was is it

385
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,560
is there anything with this amendment or

386
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,039
with these new offices that you might

387
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,719
see as like

388
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,879
as maybe

389
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,240
not good for this topic is there

390
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,759
anything that we're just not reading

391
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
correctly or we're not deciphering

392
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,958
properly is there anything in the

393
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,720
language of the bill that maybe worries

394
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,919
you that hey this is actually going to

395
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,519
do worse for the topic not better

396
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,120
well i think the biggest concern and i

397
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,320
think that's what louis lozando i

398
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,159
haven't read everything he said or

399
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,399
listened to it but i think that uh when

400
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,159
he he was upset about it is because he's

401
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
been in that system and understands kind

402
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,000
of what's going on

403
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,759
and the other thing is that it is

404
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,360
everyone is correct in saying that the

405
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,720
release of that information uh very much

406
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
was

407
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,879
it it had a lot to do with the

408
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,319
gillibrand amendment you know the timing

409
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,000
of it and everything i think everybody

410
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,600
could recognize that even though

411
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
kathleen hicks had said we're going to

412
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,079
do this uh you know i believe the

413
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,519
timeline initially was six months and

414
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,439
it's been five months and they come out

415
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,480
with it the government does nothing

416
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,360
early

417
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,600
okay they do nothing so you think it was

418
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,839
you think the odni this was a direct

419
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,440
response to the introduction of the gila

420
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,839
brand amendment

421
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,760
sure i think that the phone calls phones

422
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,600
started ringing when that went out it

423
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,879
hit the airways and everything

424
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
people were saying hey what are we doing

425
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,439
with our stuff what are we doing with

426
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,839
our stuff we don't want to get caught

427
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,160
with our pants down what are we doing in

428
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,079
addition to the fact that you've got the

429
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,719
office of the inspector general digging

430
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,159
into it too so there's a lot of cya

431
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
going on a lot of people are trying to

432
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,919
cover their ass

433
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,278
and they're trying to say you know again

434
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,360
like i mentioned nobody wants to get

435
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,360
caught with their pants down where they

436
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,759
haven't been doing anything so the idea

437
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,199
that od and i is going to take over this

438
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,360
massive office and have all this

439
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,078
jurisdiction and then prove all these

440
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,320
things the dod hasn't been doing well

441
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,919
does not sit well with the dod so

442
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,160
they're like whoa whoa

443
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,919
if nothing else we need to know what's

444
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,319
going on within our jurisdictional

445
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,319
bounds uh so that we don't look like a

446
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,639
bunch of clowns here

447
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,120
with no answers if this other agency has

448
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,720
answers now

449
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,799
beyond that tim do you think there's

450
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,959
actual information that they're they're

451
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,399
trying to get a handle on and bury prior

452
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,078
to the gila brand amendment do you think

453
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,759
that's a possibility or are we really

454
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,479
just talking about hey we're just trying

455
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,559
to cover our asses here

456
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
it really depends on what the executive

457
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,078
officers think now i can say that if it

458
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,240
was going out of the under secretary of

459
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,399
defense for intelligence office which is

460
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,759
louis elizondo's former office i think

461
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,078
you've seen the pushback that he's

462
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,078
offered i think he is a good indication

463
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,278
of how he feels they view the topic and

464
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,958
how their uh reports their analysis and

465
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,439
going into it you know going back to

466
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,599
something uh micah said earlier

467
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,199
if you you know go with this expectation

468
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,120
of what you're going to find you often

469
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,879
find it and so

470
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,198
the expectation of that office by all

471
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,159
accounts from everyone that i've spoken

472
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,799
to

473
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,319
is that they want to find bs that this

474
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,159
is not something that they need to be

475
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
exerting time effort and money on and so

476
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,958
therefore

477
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,680
the idea that that's going to be their

478
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,838
outcome it could be very highly likely

479
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,679
because that's what you know they don't

480
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,880
i think the department of defense at

481
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,679
large

482
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,078
has

483
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,439
really made it abundantly clear uh not

484
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,359
direct statements because they don't

485
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,959
like talk about it they don't want to

486
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
talk about this they don't want to deal

487
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,758
right

488
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,359
whereas some other agencies do uh you

489
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,959
know odni has

490
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,759
taken the lead the navy has taken the

491
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,719
lead

492
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,600
so

493
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,680
one of the concerns there is when in

494
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,720
having these fragmentations so you see

495
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,399
that the dod has their uap office well

496
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
od and i was like screw it we're still

497
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,679
going for it and space force says

498
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,079
hold my beer uh i think the army the

499
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,000
army is my favorite because the army is

500
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,439
is like and i come from a big army

501
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,360
family so i can say it's like everybody

502
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,720
i know from the army it was just like

503
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,240
hey man if we're going to strip club

504
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,360
you're driving i'm down you know like

505
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,839
they're

506
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
don't matter to me man

507
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,759
but the problem is there is that each

508
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,919
one of those compartments will control

509
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,039
their information and then the topic of

510
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,879
uap you won't have this centralized

511
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,639
focal point office

512
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,559
instead you'll have

513
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,599
uh you know a pilot had a sighting and

514
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,678
reported it to the navy office or the

515
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,599
odni office and they're do we have any

516
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
satellite data we've got to go to talk

517
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,119
to

518
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,759
a geospatial or the nro or the nsa to

519
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,119
try to get uh sigint or electronic

520
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,879
intelligence on it

521
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,519
and then those agencies don't

522
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,000
necessarily always hand over

523
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,038
what they have quite frankly they often

524
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
don't

525
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,279
and so you it's this idea that uh who

526
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,080
had

527
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,279
is there going to be a central office

528
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:38,000
that has the authority power and muscle

529
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,678
to really use all of the resources the

530
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,079
united states government has behind it

531
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,000
because whenever we do put all those

532
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,359
resources whether it's terrorism or

533
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,359
fighting wars

534
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,439
uh they tend to be pretty successful and

535
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,959
they have a lot of their disposal but

536
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,558
the problem is these things are not

537
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
centralized and they're not under one

538
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,918
umbrella authority outside of the

539
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,160
president you need the president you

540
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,038
know if the president would step forward

541
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,519
and say no damn it just same example i

542
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,279
gave you the nsa cia with the moscow

543
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,079
thing it took the president of the

544
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,160
united states to tell the nsa no go do

545
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,918
this and i don't care what they say

546
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,798
so i think that's part of the concern is

547
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,038
that if you've got a odni office you've

548
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,279
got a dod office and you've got these

549
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,519
other offices is that they will each be

550
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,480
examining the topic from whatever is

551
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,918
within their purview and when

552
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,599
one doesn't share with the other then

553
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,200
it's never

554
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,079
you're going to have mufon and all these

555
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,679
other things you're going to have these

556
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,798
competing it's going to turn into ufo

557
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,519
twitter

558
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,519
in the government

559
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:42,879
that sounds terrible micah

560
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,639
i've got i've got 17 seconds left so

561
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,919
in fact we're gonna have to roll over on

562
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
into the top of the occasion yeah i have

563
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,000
plenty to say and again tim really has

564
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,400
kind of given us you know the the the

565
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,240
full scope of the issues that government

566
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,960
is facing right now to an extent you

567
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,960
know i've got to kind of sympathize with

568
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,480
any element within the government or if

569
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,679
we even want to refer broadly to the

570
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,079
military

571
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
having to be tasked with trying to

572
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,079
resolve an issue that let's face it

573
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
they've been looking at for more than

574
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,240
half a century and haven't been able to

575
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,079
resolve when we talk about how as tim

576
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,839
mentioned some agencies seem to be more

577
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,439
willing to chime in on this and more

578
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,119
willing to weigh in on the topic like

579
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
the navy has been

580
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,678
whether that is necessarily by choice or

581
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,160
it is by virtue of the fact that other

582
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,519
agencies simply won't the air force

583
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
dealt with this in the longest-running

584
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,279
systematic military study by the u.s

585
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,719
government project blue book between the

586
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:37,599
1950s early 50s and 1969

587
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,960
and they remained stone silent

588
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,038
at every opportunity uh for for decades

589
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,200
thereafter with a couple of notable

590
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:48,000
exceptions after the closure of project

591
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,400
blue book again at the request of

592
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,759
congress men and women back in the 1990s

593
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,720
because there was a lot of public

594
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,839
interest

595
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,679
in the roswell crash at new mexico uh

596
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,359
and this in part due to books that were

597
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,038
being published on it television shows

598
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,038
like unsolved mysteries that were kind

599
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,240
of reinvigorating the debate a lot of

600
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,839
people were like what's really going on

601
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,519
here and so the air force kind of had to

602
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,038
get back into the game there for a time

603
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,079
they produced a couple of official

604
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,440
documents and did their own

605
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,599
investigations

606
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,919
which offered not one but several you

607
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,798
know different explanations for parts of

608
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,200
the roswell mystery um which raised a

609
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,480
lot of questions for people one being

610
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,319
okay well

611
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,519
which version is the definitive

612
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,359
narrative because they had said that

613
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,158
everything from crash test dummies to

614
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,399
charred bodies in an airplane crash to

615
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
um project mogul and you know high

616
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,000
altitude balloons that were used during

617
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,079
the cold war i mean a range of different

618
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,159
things put together over several years

619
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,558
constituted what was remembered or

620
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,760
misremembered as the roswell event

621
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:46,720
the reason that that's important is

622
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,400
because people look at that and they go

623
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,360
well first of all which is the narrative

624
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
or

625
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,879
how can we take this seriously given

626
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,240
that we first heard of course that it

627
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
was a flying disc then it was a weather

628
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,400
balloon then they say it was a mogul

629
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,158
balloon we know that they had lied

630
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
several times so how do we know they're

631
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,320
telling the truth now now in my opinion

632
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,079
having reviewed roswell you know again i

633
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,918
like a lot of ufo researchers have

634
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,158
become less and less enchanted with that

635
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,840
case as time goes on because if you

636
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,640
really look at it again i refer back to

637
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,399
the fbi single page document on that it

638
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,679
was actually from i believe let's see

639
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
let's refer to the newspapers i keep

640
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,480
them right here so i can look at all

641
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,640
this right july 8th 1947 i believe that

642
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,720
on the same date the fbi documents said

643
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,880
it appears that a high altitude uh

644
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,798
balloon was recovered they were

645
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,559
reporting that in the fbi's document a

646
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,319
day before it appears in the other

647
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,678
newspapers and it's actually stated we

648
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,839
had a weather balloon in our possession

649
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,919
so it seemed the fbi already been tipped

650
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,000
off and again the historical documents

651
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,240
seem to pretty clearly show

652
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,480
there probably wasn't as much to roswell

653
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,079
as it once had been thought but again

654
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,759
it's an interesting point to look at in

655
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,439
terms of history and what it takes to

656
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,558
get an agency like the air force back

657
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,759
into the game

658
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,038
it's no wonder they don't want to have

659
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,960
to deal with this right now and people

660
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,480
say where's the air force been why is

661
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
the navy doing this the air force never

662
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,159
wanted to have to get back into this

663
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,559
game and here again i do sympathize with

664
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,000
almost any element within government who

665
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,319
is tasked with having to do what the air

666
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,480
force tried for almost two decades to do

667
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,918
and weren't able to to achieve and so

668
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,360
the thing about you know bringing this

669
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,919
around to the gillibrand amendment you

670
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,399
know i'm not particularly surprised by

671
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,919
what has been outlined with the new aoi

672
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
msg

673
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,720
um

674
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,558
and yeah we'll we'll just refrain from

675
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,640
further jokes about the name but almost

676
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,839
everybody tim burchett in congress

677
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
actually got up and made a statement

678
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,558
about this recently and even he said i

679
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,479
don't know where they got that name from

680
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,480
but everybody's joking about this name

681
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,880
you know my theory would be that it may

682
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,200
be intentionally unpronounceable and and

683
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,720
obviously forgettable with the hope that

684
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,240
people won't be able to pronounce it

685
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,679
people won't remember and they won't

686
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
focus on it and worry about what they're

687
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,200
doing because they can't pronounce the

688
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,798
name they know the ufo thing that

689
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,798
they've got up there but i wasn't really

690
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,158
surprised by what it actually is

691
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,000
according to the dod release from last

692
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,960
tuesday what was outlined because

693
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,200
essentially all those points were in um

694
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,038
kathleen hicks memorandum that coincided

695
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,279
with the release of the odni report back

696
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,519
on june 25th you know again she's saying

697
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,519
we are very concerned with these

698
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,279
incursions in our military airspace we

699
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,440
want to try and you know be proactive

700
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,879
with looking at these and dealing with

701
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,919
these we want to collect information

702
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,960
about them

703
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,480
they never said you know we're going to

704
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,079
look at everything that happens anywhere

705
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,440
in the skies and again to tim's earlier

706
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,918
point they're not able to there are

707
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,919
jurisdictional issues with their ability

708
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,679
to even do that and so something we have

709
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,759
to take into consideration with all of

710
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,919
this is that according to what hicks

711
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,679
outlined in her memorandum if we look at

712
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,080
the odni report delivered by the uap

713
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,640
task force they state in the report this

714
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,279
is to guide future policy and future

715
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,038
efforts on this issue they seem to have

716
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,558
done essentially exactly what they said

717
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,960
that they would but the surprise had

718
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,639
been that as tim pointed out also

719
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
congress you know again senator

720
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,720
gillibrand specifically got into this a

721
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,400
little bit earlier outlined a much more

722
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,880
comprehensive plan one that would be

723
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,600
both more costly and likely would have

724
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,080
to require on the assets and abilities

725
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,759
of many different agencies again this

726
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,359
would be a much more elaborate plan and

727
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,038
i think that the dod looking at this

728
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,240
this is pure speculation on my part but

729
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:07,919
it's very much in line with what my

730
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,120
colleague has said here they're seeing

731
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,559
this and they're going whoa whoa whoa

732
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,918
hold on let's hit this off at the pass

733
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,759
because we don't want to have to mess

734
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,759
with anything as elaborate as what

735
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,278
they're proposing in this amendment and

736
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,759
so they launched this investigative

737
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:22,400
agency and it's interesting now to see

738
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,400
how those who have co-sponsored the

739
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,798
proposed amendment to the uh defense

740
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,080
authorization act for fiscal year 2022

741
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,918
are responding to this you know

742
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,278
gillibrand has spoken about it but she's

743
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,240
been a bit

744
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:36,640
um let's say she's been a bit vague uh

745
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,319
marco rubio issued a statement to air

746
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,038
force magazine he had said look you know

747
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,399
i support the government in looking into

748
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,879
these aerial incursions and these

749
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,240
mystery objects so i think that the

750
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,320
sense at least from what i'm getting

751
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,759
among you know members in congress right

752
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,000
now is that this may not be what we

753
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,240
wanted if this is what we get you know

754
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,079
we'll go with it but obviously luella's

755
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,519
ondo and many others and of course ufo

756
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,879
twitter they've expressed their concerns

757
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,400
because no this wouldn't be the

758
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,159
comprehensive plan that's outlined in

759
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,679
the gila brand amendment uh this is

760
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,600
going to be very limited in scope we

761
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
don't have any assurance that there will

762
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,079
be again annual reports delivered to

763
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,559
congress uh semi-annual reporting

764
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,558
updates and again will the public have

765
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,558
any information provided

766
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,240
now strange and paradoxical though it

767
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,960
may sound there's a part of me that

768
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,960
hopes that whatever comes of all this

769
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,400
we won't be handed all the answers

770
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
because again at the end of the day we

771
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,600
talk about this all the time at the

772
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,519
debrief we got into this because it's a

773
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,439
fun topic we do want to know the truth i

774
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,879
think we can handle the truth but i

775
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,120
doubt the government has all the answers

776
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,600
and a part of me still enjoys the quest

777
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,879
i enjoy the process of looking into this

778
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,278
and trying to understand what it's all

779
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,200
about and hopefully applying science

780
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,440
toward it so it's anybody's guess where

781
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,600
it'll go from here and we may find out

782
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,120
within a few hours but again i'm not

783
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,639
surprised and i certainly hope that

784
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,798
they're going to be a few surprises on

785
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,400
down the road maybe that civilians will

786
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,599
still be privy to

787
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
i think you guys make it such an

788
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,639
important point and i think this is so

789
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,038
critical and luis and i have been

790
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,919
talking about this for for months now is

791
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,480
how critical it is that we don't attach

792
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,480
our identities to a specific belief

793
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,159
system or outcome when it comes to uap i

794
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,919
think that's one of the things that

795
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,720
causes so much harm whether it's

796
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,480
psychological um or you know

797
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,679
sociological harm when it comes to this

798
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,640
topic because

799
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,798
if you do if the outcome is so important

800
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,720
to you a specific outcome is so

801
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,319
important to you when faced with an

802
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,960
alternate reality

803
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,639
then you're you're subject to anxiety

804
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,558
depression all of these things and i

805
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
think it's so

806
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,278
dangerous really when it comes to and

807
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,558
especially and tim you brought this up

808
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,240
earlier and i think it was such a such

809
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,319
an important point that you know when

810
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,120
society is in struggle when when when

811
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:48,558
the world is unknown when outcomes are

812
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,558
ambiguous it's very easy to put your all

813
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,599
your hopes and your faith and your

814
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,000
energy and passion into one basket

815
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,839
and i think you guys represent this

816
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,839
topic in a very with a lot of

817
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,240
journalistic integrity you represent it

818
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,639
in a way that really focuses on you know

819
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,960
let's let's have at this right let's

820
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,038
let's pick let's pick away

821
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,278
what is truth and what is fiction in

822
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,200
order to get to the truth because no

823
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,278
one's preconceived notion no one's

824
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,360
self-fulfilling prophecy is going to be

825
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,398
spot-on and it's so critical that we

826
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,839
don't allow ourselves to personally as

827
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,839
individuals

828
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,278
you know go into spirals of anxiety or

829
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,038
depression or

830
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,519
violence even

831
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,319
over topics like this

832
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:35,278
sure and i think you know i've had these

833
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,678
discussions with uh

834
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:40,079
people who've worked on the programs um

835
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,320
can you know in the contemporary program

836
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,639
so the task force that kind of stuff or

837
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,240
people who have worked with them

838
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
in different capacities whose names

839
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,919
aren't out there uh but one of the big

840
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,519
questions i had and micah brought this

841
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,880
up that the first time we ever met and

842
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,319
chatted we talked about psychology and

843
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,679
because that's really where kind of my

844
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,879
bread and butter is in cognitive

845
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,679
psychology

846
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,919
and i asked them i said you know

847
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,519
how much effort has been gone how much

848
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,600
effort has been put into this idea

849
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,639
how certain are we that we could

850
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:15,759
perceive correctly something that is

851
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,840
uh you know inherently alien right and i

852
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,919
say alien not just as not from this

853
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,798
planet i mean something totally

854
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,200
anomalous totally abstract there's no

855
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,839
guarantees there and i think that this

856
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,840
idea that we could have it right

857
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,278
is actually probably pretty wrong

858
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,879
because we can only draw on what

859
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:34,480
knowledge and information that we have

860
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,640
available to us you know what we can

861
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
read in a book what we've been told

862
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,000
we can all imagine a dragon because

863
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,159
we've seen movies by we've had them

864
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,640
described to us but but something that

865
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,799
is just totally you know outside of a

866
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,559
total anomalous discovery what is the

867
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,879
expectation that we could perceive that

868
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,480
correctly and i don't you know there

869
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,679
isn't any you know if we don't have the

870
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,079
language to describe something you're

871
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,759
not gonna be able to describe it and so

872
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,918
that's an interesting aspect of all of

873
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,398
this because we it is such a fleeting

874
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,000
topic i think you know that would be one

875
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,158
of the uh

876
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,839
cornerstone tenets of this topic is it's

877
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,520
always just a little bit you know maybe

878
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,480
it's a fleeting glance or something or

879
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,398
it's

880
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,720
a very intense experience but it's not

881
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,879
captured on video or audio and all these

882
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,440
different things so it's never this full

883
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,720
picture of what we define as being true

884
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,960
factual

885
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,798
or just ground truth reality

886
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,880
and so you know what does that mean

887
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,519
about it i don't know

888
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,360
other than perhaps there is aspects of

889
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,879
this it's very difficult for us because

890
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,359
we don't

891
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,880
we can't perceive what's going on and so

892
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,359
to your point mike

893
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,840
absolutely you know there there is this

894
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,479
idea that if we encounter anything truly

895
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,959
anomalous uh we're not gonna have the

896
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,558
the knowledge base uh existing we're all

897
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,640
gonna be done in kruger here you know

898
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,038
we're gonna believe that it's something

899
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
but uh there's nothing that says that's

900
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,679
what it is so yeah if you put all your

901
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:02,240
eggs in in one basket um you're right it

902
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,000
can cause a lot of distress both on

903
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,319
yourself emotionally psychologically and

904
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,880
just in general and so

905
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,879
part of that fun of as long as there's

906
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,120
an unknown it can be anything and so

907
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,440
that's kind of fun you know it is fun to

908
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:20,158
me and so let's enjoy that aspect of it

909
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,278
because even if aliens flew in there's

910
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,679
really

911
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,519
we have nothing on our plate here that

912
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,519
says we would see them understand them

913
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,839
or even comprehend it because it would

914
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,798
be alien right

915
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,918
abstract

916
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,158
right

917
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,240
um real quick just i wanted to go back

918
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,799
to what senator tim burchard said

919
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,720
yesterday on the floor um just touch on

920
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,200
it because he did kind of mock the name

921
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,319
of this new office but then you get also

922
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,919
yeah after you do that louise we're

923
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,798
gonna let these guys go yep absolutely

924
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,799
um

925
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:49,839
aft but then right after that he wrote a

926
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,240
letter

927
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,759
to um ronald s moultrie the under

928
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,319
secretary of defense for intelligence

929
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,000
and security uh basically thanking him

930
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,038
for this new office

931
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,278
and then

932
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,000
but also saying um

933
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,319
you know i'm i'm requesting that the aoi

934
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,558
msg uh brief members of congress on

935
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,278
their findings in a classified setting

936
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,440
followed by a public hearing which means

937
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,798
we could worst case scenario maybe get

938
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,320
some public hearings out of these

939
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,278
offices what do you think that would

940
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,119
look like

941
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,200
and could we trust this office to

942
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,199
provide the american people with

943
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,880
whitney you know

944
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,480
would we get david framer and alex

945
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,360
dietrich in a public setting like that

946
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,798
from this office do you think

947
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,240
i highly doubt it i think when they're

948
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,038
talking about public hearings we would

949
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,519
see

950
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,278
uh something consistent with what we see

951
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,880
all the time with the public hearings

952
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,960
especially the national security public

953
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,640
hearings where you have an agency the

954
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,720
the head of whatever agency comes and

955
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,000
briefs congress publicly

956
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,919
and uh they're oftentimes um

957
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,240
not all that informative you know if

958
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,360
anybody anybody else is a nerd like me

959
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,278
that watch the the 2021 national threats

960
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,240
uh hearing where they have all the heads

961
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,240
the cia the nsa od and is all there and

962
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,919
they all brief what are the big threats

963
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,079
uh you know one of the ones that

964
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,519
obviously came up was covet you know it

965
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,119
was questioned well do we know where

966
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,038
covet came from and uh it's this uh

967
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,158
well we you know

968
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,879
it could have been this it could have

969
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,200
been that and so you very likely could

970
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,039
see the exact same thing with uap you

971
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,319
could see uh

972
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:25,599
the the director of national

973
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,639
intelligence sitting there telling

974
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:31,519
congress yes we what you read in that uh

975
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,000
report in june being said verbally

976
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,319
you know yes we have this that the only

977
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,480
nice thing i guess would be in these

978
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,960
instances you do have lawmakers that can

979
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,599
ask questions they can ask follow-up

980
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,440
questions you know marco rubio can stand

981
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,519
up and demand

982
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,000
is it aliens you know

983
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,759
and some of these politicians do a

984
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,558
really good job

985
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:57,119
of of grandstanding so you know i think

986
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,079
that's where the the idea that people uh

987
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,439
i would say that the public has

988
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,879
definitely had an impact when you see

989
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,480
these lawmakers

990
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,640
talking about it as much as they have

991
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,399
yeah so yeah you know there's um

992
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,080
who's the co-sponsor from south carolina

993
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,119
why am i drawing a blank on it lindsey

994
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,720
graham

995
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,038
lindsey graham yeah yeah i mean good

996
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,240
gosh he could get all sorts of animated

997
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,919
you know i don't know somebody's ever

998
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,000
seen him in the confirmation hearing so

999
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,919
yeah who knows

1000
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,679
you'll be up there screaming jumping up

1001
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,480
and down

1002
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,240
an interesting day that's for sure

1003
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,919
i mean just politically speaking i would

1004
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,240
be so confused i wouldn't know what to

1005
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,919
do with myself

1006
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,960
i think i was like oh i like i like what

1007
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,679
he's saying but god i really don't like

1008
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,840
oh but him that's

1009
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,320
if there's any positive you know if it's

1010
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,199
not disclosure perhaps the best positive

1011
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,038
uh

1012
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,480
outcome that can come from all of this

1013
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,000
news is people are actually paying

1014
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,679
attention to how the government operates

1015
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and lawmakers operate and everything and

1016
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,559
they they may go this is

1017
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,880
stupid like how we how do we get

1018
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,240
anything achieved like we've never

1019
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,320
we haven't faced another attack because

1020
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,159
nobody's wanted to evidently because how

1021
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:05,519
does anything get achieved so if nothing

1022
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,360
else hopefully maybe people pay

1023
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,599
attention to that and go man some things

1024
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,118
need to be changed here yeah and if

1025
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,639
congressional hearings occur let's just

1026
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,159
hope that it's not congress asking

1027
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,119
robert mueller questions can you repeat

1028
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,679
the question right right

1029
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,679
yeah right i'll refer to the report the

1030
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,200
language in the report

1031
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,358
and i think that was sort of like a

1032
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,598
secondary goal so the of the phone home

1033
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,199
was just hey teaching people how to

1034
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,359
interact with their government is a good

1035
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,519
thing you know how to find the

1036
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,199
representatives and you can take this

1037
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,199
formula and apply it to whatever

1038
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,398
activism you want and it works the same

1039
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,118
way

1040
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,960
yeah that's just you know it's fun

1041
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,879
absolutely no i think that's great i

1042
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,918
think that's that's always been a big

1043
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,199
thing of mine that's how government's

1044
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,239
supposed to work it doesn't matter if we

1045
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,559
want the government to go look for

1046
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,759
unicorns if enough people in a democracy

1047
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:53,440
want them to look for unicorns well

1048
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,639
that's what they need to do then because

1049
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,519
that's the way it's supposed to work so

1050
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,320
yeah

1051
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,719
i definitely commend you guys for that

1052
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,160

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,920
developments like you know the

1114
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,440
hypersonic glide vehicle that was

1115
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,400
apparently tested by russia and it's

1116
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,159
miscible missile deployment capabilities

1117
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,760
the pentagon looking at that and saying

1118
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:16,960
wow how did they get to that point and

1119
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,720
then like what days later they

1120
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,400
established this new uap investigative

1121
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,480
unit again we're saying that there may

1122
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,000
be a lot of things that may uh be

1123
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,679
catalysts for what we're seeing

1124
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,838
happening with regard to the uap topic

1125
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,440
and again we do sometimes look at

1126
