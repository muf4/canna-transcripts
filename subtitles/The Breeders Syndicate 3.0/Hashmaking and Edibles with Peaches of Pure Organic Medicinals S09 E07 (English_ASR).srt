00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,518
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,558
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,160
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,399
of

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039

The Syndicate is a collection of seed

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,479
makers that want to push back against

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,159
all the smok and mirrors in doing so we

20
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,279
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

21
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,839
those who oppose and my personal mission

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,399
has become much bigger than myself

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,719
welcome to the Cannabis underground this

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,719

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,198
revolution hey everyone um both thousand

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,680
and my myself are big Advocates of women

27
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:08,478
in our community and we're also big

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,759
Advocates of them telling their um

29
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,959
truths their their true stories their

30
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,040
adventures in

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:19,319
cannabis and uh that's not always going

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,118
to be a beautiful pretty picture um

33
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,399
especially when women talk about their

34
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:28,640
lives so a trigger warning here um I

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,000
don't normally do anything like that any

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,799
kind of trigger warnings or anything PC

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,319
but in this case like it is one of those

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,200
things that I know there are are some

39
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:43,239
women that that have so so much PTSD

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,040
they cannot um even stand hearing about

41
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,798
it because it triggers them too much and

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,920
I respect that and so does thousand so

43
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,360
does peach so we wanted to put a

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,599
disclaimer in here at the very beginning

45
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:58,078
that um there may be some uncomfortable

46
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,319
Parts it it'll only be brief but um yeah

47

85
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,878
so peaches what were some of your

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,640
earliest experiences with the

87
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:42,518
plant well um to be perfectly honest

88
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:45,318
even though I come um from a third

89
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,480
generation I'm a third generation grower

90
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:51,199
um my grandpa grew and my dad grew I

91
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:55,199
never messed with weed as a kid my

92
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:58,199
parents were very strict um the only

93
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,399
time I touched weed as a kid was when I

94
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,679
took it from my dad and and I put it in

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,840
a baloney sandwich in a lunch bag and I

96
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,840
gave it to my boyfriend at

97
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,239
school and he got caught with it and we

98
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,759
got trouble and I got I got my ass beat

99
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,600
for that one oh I bet drawing attention

100
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,719
yeah I I drew attention to us in not a

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,520
very good way no so I got in trouble for

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,160
that one and then I never smoked weed

103
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,959
until I graduated and got out on my own

104
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,080
um and then unfortunately the first weed

105
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:36,399
I ever did really smoke was uh some

106
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:39,359
Mexican weed in the park and then I met

107
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,198
Buckshot and Buckshot had his own weed

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,199
that he was growing um it was some Bag

109
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:50,879
seed from as he's a rosta lady in a

110
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,720
Subaru in Humbolt is where he got it

111
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,439
okay and it was purple weed and he got

112
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,000
bag seed from it and for some reason he

113
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,160
named it the super green and so he was

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,038
growing that when we got together and

115
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,800
that was my first experience seeing a

116
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:09,959
plant um or uh getting to smoke actually

117
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,400
really good weed that was my real first

118
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:19,198
experience and that was what in

119
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:21,198
1996 um when we first met um because

120
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,879
yeah my dad never showed me his plants

121
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,199
my grandpa didn't show me his plants it

122
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:31,000
wasn't our family wasn't like really out

123
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,639
there about it um my grandpa grew weed

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,240
to give my mom because my mom was

125
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:40,120
diagnosed with breast cancer um and so

126
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,160
she was going to La for chemotherapy so

127
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,639
my grandpa grew the weed that my mom

128
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,520
took to LA to hustle to pay for her

129
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,199
hotel and to go to chemotherapy wow and

130
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:56,279
then my grandma also hustled weed to

131
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:59,919
help pay for my mom's stuff gangster so

132
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:02,198
um and then my dad grew weed you know

133
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,560
just for himself because my mom passed

134
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,000
away when I was four she she didn't make

135
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,038
it um you know and unfortunately I wish

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,918
so much that she had known that that

137
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:16,439
same weed she was selling that she could

138
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:19,839
have used herself yeah um to help treat

139
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:23,038
what she had for sure and and she didn't

140
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,318
have a clue and so uh she didn't make it

141
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,318
and so my dad you know my dad's been the

142
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,639
black sheep of the family he grew weed

143
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,960
we got busted and raided um I remember

144
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,639
that very specifically that day having

145
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,959
the cops come down the driveway and like

146
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,120
trying to figure out why are all the

147
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,560
cops here like what's going on and they

148
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,079
sat us down on the couch and they told

149
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,639
us to stay there and they searched our

150
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,038
whole house and they took all my dad's

151
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,240
weed and they took all his plants and my

152
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:55,079
dad was their motorcycle mechanic

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,319
because it's a small town and

154
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:01,560
uh uh so they didn't take him to jail

155
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:05,280

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,599
tucked under the willow trees in the

162
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,758
sand so they didn't have to be watered

163

could smell it come out of the bedroom

166
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:34,319
but uh you know it wasn't like how I am

167
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,519
with my kids you know my kids know all

168
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,039
about the weed they help they you know

169
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:42,758
all about it it wasn't like that for me

170
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:45,038
you know you know I noticed that a lot

171
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,038
of parents that were Growers and had

172
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:52,560
kids either were very permissive wanted

173
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:54,120
to involve in it like educate them or

174
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,158
silent about it because they had the

175
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,519
other mindset that their kids could

176
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,918
potentially tell the wrong person at

177
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,959
school and bring down

178
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,279
you know like there's not a lot of in

179
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,079
between between the two and uh I was

180
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,478
going to mention where where peaches is

181
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,240
from isn't typical California it's

182
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,719
actually very woodsy and beautiful

183
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Sequoia area so there's going to be a

184
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,319
lot of creeks a lot of mountains stuff

185
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,439
like that yep is it it's mountainous

186
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,280
it's very mountainous uh our we have 40

187
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,120
acres that backed up to the National

188
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,119
Forest oh wow and there was a whole big

189
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,200
creek that ran right through our

190
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,440
property right so Gorilla growing was

191
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,360
like quite a I don't know natural

192
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,000
decision I guess given that kind of

193
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,680
terrain yeah yep um so wow that's

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
amazing so your family has had this

195
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,039
quite long and intense relationship with

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,120
the plant and all these different ways

197
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,799
okay okay we'll probably come back to

198
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,399
some of that but um what were some of

199
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,359
the first because the show is going to

200
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,200
be centered on extracts I didn't want to

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,720
ask what were the first extracts you

202
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:06,360
tried

203
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:09,399
well that would be um some dry sift that

204
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,320
we did in the in the back bedroom

205
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:17,480
probably in like in

206
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,560
96 um uh he showed me by taking he put

207
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,399
the flour in a sifter just like the

208
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,439
sifter I used to sift the hash out of it

209
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,720
comes out of the freeze dryer now and he

210
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,000
put flour in there and he had one of the

211
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,120
um glasses the glass pieces from one of

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,039
the grow lights MH and put it at an

213
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,839
angle and then had a a piece of paper at

214
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,958
the

215
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,920
bottom shook it over the glass and it

216
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,679
would go down and then the THC would

217
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,759
stick to the glass and everything else

218
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:50,159
would go to the paper and then we would

219
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,439
take a card and card that up and we

220
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:56,240
would use that on joints and bowls and

221
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,800
so that technically was the very first

222
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,399
extract yeah um definitely

223
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,000
yeah I've never heard of that but

224
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,639
that's he he did that he developed that

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,159
when he was 14 that's so cool and uh so

226
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,799
that was the first time he showed me how

227
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,639
to do that and then the first time I

228
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:17,000
actually made uh ice waterer hash was in

229
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:21,078
uh

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,839
1999 uh we bought the first set of the

231
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:26,039
one gallon bubble bags from the O BC in

232
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,560
Oakland was that is that bubble ban oh

233
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,719
no Oakland is uh oh was it bubble ban

234
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,479
yeah yep shout out Bubble Man yep the

235
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,839
very first one so they were one gallon

236
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,360
bags and um and actually what's crazy is

237
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,600
the first strand we washed and made hash

238
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,079
with was

239
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,320
bubbleberry oh that's nice did it make

240
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:49,078
good hash it did make very good

241
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,639
hash did the berry stick with it do you

242
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:54,799
remember honestly I I couldn't tell you

243
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,320
specifically if you asked Buckshot that

244
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,479
he could probably tell you he probably

245
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,480
would remember huh he would so this is

246
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,240
the original bubbleberry um yes from s

247
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,720
MAA from Tony very cool very

248
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,000
cool

249
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,440
um uh I just blanked I had another

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,720
question which was

251
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:20,839
um what was your how did you see hash

252
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,519
relative to smoking flow at the

253
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,000
time yeah I remember it used to knock me

254
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,278
on my ass cuz I was a hell of a

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,399
lightweight um and we had had just had

256
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:37,559
our daughter and so um I was still in

257
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,639
that hole I can't smoke during mom time

258
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:44,399
you know sure nowadays geeez yeah right

259
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,959
that's a time to do it yeah so I you

260
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,078
know for me the hash was like a

261
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:53,359
nighttime thing um I I really like the

262
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:58,039
taste of it

263
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,480
um so I I but I love flour I can't the

264
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:01,559
flow is still one of of my favorite

265
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,320
things to smoke I'm not going to lie as

266
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,599
much as I like to make cash um there's

267
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,120
nothing like good

268
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,920
flour like I will I I have to

269
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:19,000
say um so the hash for me back then was

270
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,838
just it was the like nighttime smoke and

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,240
yeah get the job and normally what you

272
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,560
would just add it to a joint is that the

273
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,639
yeah like you know the snake in the

274
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,359
grass that's what we used to call they

275
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,399
call them hash holes now yeah but it was

276
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,399
the snake in the grass or we would do

277
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,198
the um on top of a

278
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:42,399
bowl

279
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:44,919
yeah the classic yeah okay okay so just

280
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,919
to round out this little um Icebreaker

281
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,958
introduction would you please tell us

282
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:53,198
about first of all pure organic

283
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:55,439
medicinals and then uh GI Mary Janes

284
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:58,039
just to let the audience know like you

285
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,240
know what you're up to well uh we start

286
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:04,759
with GI Mar James because that came

287
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,720
first um back in 2018 we got involved

288
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:11,278
with uh battle buds who was associated

289
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,000
with the weed for Warrior Project um and

290
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,360
so we became a sponsor for that and it

291
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,600
was a great event it was men and women

292
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,278
combined they would come together and

293
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,399
you know have like a day where they did

294
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:28,320
food and hung out and they had weed and

295
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,639
a giveaway and stuff and then I noticed

296
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,680
there was women there and a lot of the

297
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,839
women just congregated alone together

298
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,838
and um that's when I thought of starting

299
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,839
GI Mary Janes which would be the same

300
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,959
concept that the battle buds was based

301
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,120
off of which was a veteran group but it

302
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,518
was going to be for just women veterans

303
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,000
so the women veterans could come

304
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,039
together and have a safe place to meet

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,799
where there wasn't men because a lot of

306
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:04,198
women veterans have um um you know been

307
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:09,039
assaulted yeah they have dealt with a

308
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:10,958
lot of [ __ ] from men and I my intuition

309
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,559
when I saw the group interaction was

310
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,319
that these women needed a safe place of

311
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,479
their own to do the same thing not that

312
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,680
they weren't having fun but I wanted to

313
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,120
help provide them with that same aspect

314
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,159
by themselves and so um I started doing

315
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,799
that and it was going really well until

316
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:32,240
coid happened and we lost our meeting

317
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,879
spot and so we haven't been able to have

318
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,560
meetings anymore um until I can find

319
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,639
somewhere that will let us come and you

320
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:43,198
know smoke and hang out and do all that

321
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,120
stuff can I ask as well were you just to

322
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,958
just to be clear were you ever in the

323
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,759
military yourself

324
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:55,439
or no I was not I am not a veteran um my

325
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:59,320
dad is an xmarine my grandpa was a World

326
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,199
War II prisoner of war my uncle was a

327
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,199
Navy veteran from

328
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:07,519
Vietnam um so I grew up around the

329
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,000
veterans and honestly the only I mean I

330
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,720
know a lot of people always say oh I

331
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
would have joined but um my grandpa

332
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,519
asked me not to join the military um I

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,320
was actually in the process of trying to

334
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,078
sign up for it and he came to me and

335
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,959
asked me to not do that to

336
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,879
myself and my grandpa was my world my

337
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,000
grandma and grandpa raised me pretty

338
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,360
much after my mom died and my dad fell

339
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,879
apart and I watched my

340
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,919
grandpa struggle every day with PTSD and

341
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,278
the stuff that happened to him as a

342
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,399
prisoner of

343
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:46,198
war and uh it made me have a lot of

344
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:49,240
compassion for veterans and what they

345
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:51,399
experience and so it was just something

346
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,799
that was dear to my heart and I saw

347
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:58,278
these people struggling and cannabis was

348
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:00,439
helping them and I had cannabis and so I

349
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:04,078
just chose to

350
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,600
help I'm glad you did it sounds like uh

351
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:10,318
that's super important it's very smart

352
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,839
to have a space like that for women

353
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:13,759
because that does happen a lot I have

354
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,000
friends you know that have been through

355
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,759
that and it's not the most comfortable

356
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,440
environment um military unions and stuff

357
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,480
like that

358
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,160
yeah no it's it's very

359
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,560
um very

360
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:31,879
loadable what you what you've been doing

361
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:35,278
super cool work um doing the good work

362
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,559
as people might say Okay um we I'm sure

363
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,439
again we'll come back to that um how

364
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,159
about pure organic

365
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:47,480
medicinals so they found me on

366
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:52,078
Instagram um about I don't know four

367
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:55,199
years but four years ago um honestly I I

368
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:58,039
refer to us as a band of

369
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,318
Misfits um because we are not corporate

370
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,000
cannabis in any way shape or form that's

371
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:04,959
why we haven't hit the market yet

372
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,959
because it has taken us like they were

373
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,000
it's been six years for everybody else

374
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,318
involved I've been involved for three

375
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,919
years now and what I brought to the

376
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,879
table was my hash experience my edible

377
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,600
experience and then all the equipment

378
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,319
that we had acquired over the last few

379
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:28,798
years is what's making their hash room

380
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:30,440
run um so there's you know two main guys

381
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,279
who have been in

382
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,600
cannabis you know their whole lives and

383
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,480
so we're just we're trying to come to

384
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:43,558
Market with um you know we have a

385
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:46,919
solventless license and uh it's it's

386
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:49,759
hard just to yeah for for someone like

387
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,520
me who's not really like close in any

388
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:55,000
way to like the American you know legal

389
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:58,798
Market or license side of things what do

390
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,960
you mean when you say um you have got to

391
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,599
market yet and so what what does it mean

392
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,558
that what's been happening in this whole

393
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:08,558
time um we're jumping through

394
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:11,678
hoops um you know there's all the

395
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:14,359
testing that has to be done

396
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,919
um we had to find a

397
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,038
distributor uh

398
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,600
it's well considering the fact that

399
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,480
there's only three of us and in the last

400
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,678
month I've had to wash by myself

401
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:34,200
probably like 150 lbs of weed 5 lbs at a

402
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:37,038
time wow um ho it takes a while um and

403
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,038
then that has to go for pre-testing and

404
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,919
then we got to package it and then it's

405
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,119
got to go to distribution and then it

406
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,080
goes through another round of testing

407
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,000
and then it can actually go to market

408
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,599
wow okay so just to I'm just trying to

409
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,960
signpost for everyone this is already

410
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,240
after after you've gotten your license

411
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,558
right this is already postlicensing and

412
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,079
you're still having to do like basic

413
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:05,639
more compliance stuff yeah cuz they they

414
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:08,038
come every year and do an inspection and

415
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,679
if there's anything that's not perfect

416
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:13,480
then you have to fix that and you have

417
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,720
to do this and change that and all that

418
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,720
wonderful stuff and being not corporate

419
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,079
is is kind of a major Boon because it

420
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,000
cuts you off from a lot of funding um am

421
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,678
I right yes that's been our biggest

422
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
holdup um in fact I know everybody

423
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,840
thinks I'm like woohoo you're a hash

424
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,200
maker um I don't usually get paid when I

425
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,240
come up here um I have literally I I've

426
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,600
gotten paid a few times when they've had

427
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,640
money from our few investors that we've

428
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,240
gotten but most of the time I come up

429
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,400
and I work on my own um yeah trying to

430
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,400
you

431
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:56,080
know I I want to build a legacy for my

432
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,400
kids you know my I my son you know Tiner

433
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,240
he he's going to be the fourth

434
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,080
generation I already know my daughter

435
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,798
she's grown she's you know she doesn't

436
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,960
want to do anything with the weed world

437
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:10,319
but that's fine that's her choice she's

438
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,120
doing great um out in Texas and uh so

439
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,319
for me this is really important I want

440
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,319
to bring I want to create a legacy for

441
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,079
him that is legal that he doesn't have

442
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,439
to worry and be scared about going to

443
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,918
jail and having the cops kick down our

444
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,720
door and all that [ __ ] that we've

445
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,240
worried about our whole lives and so

446
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,880
funding has been our our biggest hurdle

447
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,599
you know we've had to literally stop

448
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,799
what we're doing and wait for to try to

449
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,678
conjure up some money here or there one

450
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,960
of the guys went back to work full-time

451
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,440
to get another job just to help pay for

452
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,840
the mortgage and

453
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,519
stuff jeez so you know it's not easy

454
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,279
it's not all the you know Glam and Glitz

455
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,319
that a lot of people think it is it's

456
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,759
really hard work and they don't make it

457
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,519
easy especially if you're not a rich

458
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:58,519
millionaire like anybody who's on the

459
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,679
market now that is legacy you can

460
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:04,440
guarantee those people have worked their

461
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:07,600
asses off to get where they're at for

462
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,759
sure yeah it's I me it's a lot and you

463
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,278
know like there's also the added cost of

464
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,038
testing each time you bring in a new

465
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,759
strain each different way you extract it

466
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,839
has to be tested that cost a lot of

467
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,640
money like a lot of people just assume

468
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:23,319
that that's there it's cheap but it's

469
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:26,919
not it's super not yeah every COA is

470
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:30,918
$475 exactly it's so that's for every

471
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,960
metric ticket if I wash 10 lbs of runs

472
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,640
that's a metric ticket if I have

473
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,840
something else that's another metric

474
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,679
ticket and and then if I take that runs

475
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,000
and I put it in live rosin that has to

476
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,840
be tested and if I take that same runs

477
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,798
and I put it in a cart that cart still

478
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:48,759
has to be tested separate and then if I

479
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:50,480
take that and put it into an edible that

480
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,640
has to have separate testing you can't

481
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:57,038
just test what I made once and put it

482
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,919
into three products exactly so every

483
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,079
basically every point of the production

484
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,240
chain almost or the supply chain needs

485
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:05,879
to be tested every time it's a new

486
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,400
enters into a new product and form if

487
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:13,320
I'm correct yeah

488
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,360
yeah that in form has to have a COA yeah

489
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:19,200
yeah so I guess just another reminder or

490
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:21,000
insight into the fact that you know it's

491
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,519
essentially still very much pay to win

492
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,960
or pay to play I guess um you know you

493
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:30,000
really need to be able to either

494
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,159
sacrifice enough you know afford yeah

495
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,839
what is an immense cost to get going um

496
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:39,159
yes

497
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:42,720
okay um stepping away from some of that

498
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:46,278
uh what you called it um jumping through

499
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,720
hoops and going back to the the hash for

500
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:52,599
a little bit um one thing I wanted to

501
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,839
ask you about was how you see your

502
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:58,678
process having developed like you told

503
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,038
us about some of the very first you know

504
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,519
quotequote extract or hash that you

505
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:07,440
made what how how did this journey go

506
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,798
for you you know like first of all like

507
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,759
just developing yourself as someone

508
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,480
who's doing hash at home and then

509
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:18,079
transitioning into this bigger scale

510
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,880
it's more commercial scale um well let's

511
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,879
see

512
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,278
um in uh I was actually in you know

513
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,880
we've always done our own personal thing

514
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:33,679
and for friends and family um yeah maybe

515
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,600
we can just start there first then just

516
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,759
start with like what was it like making

517
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,278
hash for your friends and

518
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:43,319
family it was

519
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:47,440
nice it was you know a one gallon bucket

520
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:49,918
on the kitchen counter um and it was

521
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,320
just really simple you know you we would

522
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,440
do it an ounce at a time like uh I think

523
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:59,839
one of our best washers at the time was

524
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:03,960
the LA Confidential that we had um it it

525
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:06,678
always washed well um and then you know

526
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,240
so it was just like a you know cuz

527
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:13,080
Buckshot got hurt way early in our

528
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:16,919
relationship with his back and uh so

529
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:19,119
he's been basically the stay atome take

530
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,720
care of the you know things at the house

531
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:25,439
and then I've been out working and and

532
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:29,798
you know handling all that stuff and

533
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:34,558
uh in uh 2018 I was in nursing

534
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:36,720
school and uh I finished my pre Rex and

535
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:40,599
all that and I actually got my

536
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:44,000
associates degree in uh science oh wow

537
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:48,599
and uh I was supposed to go to RN

538
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,480
school for the rest of it and uh the pro

539
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,480
I went and I was going to sign up for RN

540
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,519
school and I went to the meeting and I

541
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,240
was doing my stuff and she's like okay

542
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:02,599
well um you she's like do you work I'm

543
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:06,558
like yeah I'm a full-time CNA I you know

544
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:08,519
I work 40 plus hours of work a week as

545
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,398
you know a CNA and she was like well you

546
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:14,038
can't do that anymore and I'm like what

547
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:15,918
do you mean she's like well to go to R

548
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,240
in school you need to be in school

549
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,559
fulltime ah you're going to have to quit

550
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,919
your job and go to school because

551
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:28,240
there's no way you can do both it just

552
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:31,120
doesn't work and um I couldn't I I

553
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,960
couldn't quit my job how are we going to

554
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,158
eat I can't support us I have to work

555
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,120
like these are realistic American

556
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,159
choices now it it is it was no joke like

557
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,278
I had gone through all my financial aid

558
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:47,840
for all the prxs I did sure um I had

559
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:51,119
nothing left and so we had

560
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:54,158
literally uh his mom had given us 10

561
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,119
grand and I was she cuz she was like you

562
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,399
know put this towards nursing school do

563
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,558
something and I was like

564
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:03,119
well I can't live off this long enough

565
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,798
for to go to nursing school cuz that was

566
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,719
my first thing no way yeah and so

567
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,440
Buckshot took it and invested in uh what

568
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,000
the clear

569
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,880
class and uh learned how to do

570
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,119
distillate well when he did that they

571
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,720
were supposed to give him a job yeah and

572
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,000
that was the plan he was going to get a

573
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,519
job doing that and then I could go to

574
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,759
school to be an RN and we would be okay

575
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:31,079
cuz once I was done I'd be able to

576
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,798
support us and we'd be fine we wouldn't

577
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:37,359
have to struggle anymore well they never

578
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:40,440
gave him a job they sold him some CBD

579
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,879
distillate and taught him how to do all

580
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,798
this stuff took his money and then never

581
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,559
gave him a job so we were sitting here

582
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:53,000
and you know he was already into the

583
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:56,278
rosin and learning all that and had a

584
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,319
the first Sasquatch uh M1 press he was

585
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:02,720
doing flower rosin

586
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,278
and uh when this happened I was like

587
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,360
[ __ ] what are we going to like what am I

588
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:09,640
going to do I can't go to school like I

589
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,918
know how to grow good weed I know that

590
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,278
like it's something I've always done

591
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,640
I've always made good Edibles I mean

592
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,798
back in the day I used to make edibles

593
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:23,759
for the velia clubs for the medical

594
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:25,639
clubs and so um we decided to put

595
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,679
everything into

596
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:34,399
hash and we bought a freeze dryer and we

597
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:37,919
bought um the bags and we started with

598
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:41,599
uh the fruitless trash cans yeah and I

599
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,038
literally washed hash in our kitchen on

600
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:48,079
scaffolding on a ladder standing on a

601
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,960
ladder to wash hat he actually has proof

602
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,119
of this there's pictures

603
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,600
a um and that's how we started with the

604
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,798
white fruitless trash cans and we got

605
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:02,158
the ice extract bags and a free dryer

606
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:05,038
and uh it we started there and then we

607
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,720
started to do the seshes and it honestly

608
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:10,158
just kind

609
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,880
of took off from there yeah what do you

610
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:17,120
mean by the seses well around here the

611
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,360
secret sesh where uh the black market

612
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,719
companies come together in some rented

613
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,839
secret location and we set up a table

614
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,440
and they let people come in and they get

615
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,639
to shop kind of like a farmers market

616
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,278
yeah

617
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,519
we got it it was it was fun it was a lot

618
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,759
of fun I'm not going to lie um it was a

619
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,440
blast because you got to meet

620
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,278
like-minded people and become a part of

621
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,519
the community and then we were helping

622
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:46,640
people again and it just was a lot of

623
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,919
fun so I did want to dip into the tech a

624
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,960
bit more at this point um just so up

625
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,640
until this point of like scaling up when

626
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,880
you're still dealing with like you know

627
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,399
the one gallon bags and whatnot in that

628
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,159
early era what did you learn do you

629
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:08,119
think about making

630
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:10,919
hash honestly back then I I don't I

631
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:15,119
didn't learn as much as I did once we

632
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:16,880
got the bigger equipment um okay cuz

633
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,759
there wasn't as much information out

634
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,039
there you know like and and we wen't

635
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,519
ones to be on the internet very

636
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:27,119
much uh that's actually a question I did

637
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:29,919
want to ask at this point so how did you

638
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,798
get that information to start making

639
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,559
cash where did you learn that I have

640
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:40,000
that came from Buckshot yeah he he is a

641
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:43,558
research Powerhouse um

642
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,640
okay weed has been his life forever and

643
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:49,639
so he had read I'm pretty sure some

644
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,399
information from Neville about hash

645
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:57,159
making and that had peaked his interest

646
00:29:53,398 --> 00:30:00,918
and that's when we got the one gon bags

647
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:02,840
and and so um the biggest part I think

648
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,000
about that point was learning how to dry

649
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:08,038
it right cuz there was no freeze dryers

650
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,919
and so we would wash it through the

651
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:13,640
little bags and then they when the kit

652
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,840
you got these little screens they're

653
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,159
orange and

654
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:21,319
blue and we would put that on top of a

655
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,399
piece of cardboard yeah and then put the

656
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:26,439
hash on it so it would draw it out and

657
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:29,119
then if you keep it in the fridge it

658
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,600
helps the whole process and does all

659
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,439
that so that was probably the biggest

660
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,119
learning curve at that point was just

661
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:38,880
learning how to dry it right so that you

662
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,558
would get it moldy yeah I've I've heard

663
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,360
this I I don't know much about like I

664
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,798
said earlier like I'm not you know very

665
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,199
Advanced at all and in hash making but I

666
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:51,278
have I have heard that you know the

667
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,240
drying part is really really key um you

668
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:56,480
know like my hardest part when I was

669
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,319
learning how to like use bubble bags and

670
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,960
stuff I was teaching myself because I

671
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:02,879
you know like I mean the information was

672
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,200
out there at that point but like I just

673
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,679
was stubborn and figured well I just see

674
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,639
how people do this they just stir it

675
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,320
with some ice no big deal right you just

676
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:13,719
pull up yeah nothing but but I was

677
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,759
taking like dry leaves that would

678
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,319
crumble up and crush up you know just

679
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,919
stuffing it all in there getting a full

680
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:24,678
drill with a painter paddle on drill

681
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,519
speed and just go for 45 minutes and

682
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,759
yeah that did not make exceptional hash

683
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,519
it did not it's some of the worst [ __ ]

684
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:35,119
ever so a lot of it is is to do with

685
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:39,558
preparation too right like big part yes

686
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:42,599
like uh we learned about cuz uh We've

687
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:44,839
we've done we do leaf and we have done

688
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:47,240
Leaf but most of the time we like to to

689
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:50,519
wash flour because it just gives you

690
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,319
better results and um one of the things

691
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,558
we did learn back then was about making

692
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,879
sure you froze it first even if it was

693
00:31:54,558 --> 00:32:00,960
dry yeah um cuz it just helps

694
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,840
the stocks break off yeah yeah it just

695
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,840
makes it

696
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:09,000
easier um on the point that Matt was

697
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,278
making um yeah the other the other kind

698
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,278
of variable that I see people obviously

699
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:17,599
needing to control to some degree is the

700
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:19,880
the kind of like how much agitation are

701
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,439
you actually introducing and there's

702
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,278
obviously a sweet spot right like you

703
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,080
need to move something around but not

704
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,359
too much or you're going Break Stuff

705
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,319
yeah you don't want to go drill

706
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,879
drill speed is a little much yeah cuz

707
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:37,158
you got to keep in

708
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,960
mind that every time a leaf breaks in

709
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,600
there it releases chlorophyll yeah so

710
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,759
when you release chlorophyll that's when

711
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:49,798
you get the green slime and so but you

712
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:52,638
also have to wash hard enough that

713
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:55,599
you're you push the water through the

714
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,558
bud you know like I like how a river

715
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,240
rushes through a canyon

716
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,480
yeah that's what you want the water to

717
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,759
do so it'll rush through there and break

718
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,960
the heads off and carry them out so you

719
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:12,319
can't be too gentle but you can't be you

720
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:16,960
got to not be too rough and I have found

721
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:20,798
um you know my I use a 20 gallon and so

722
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,278
that means I'm washing 5 lbs of uh fresh

723
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:27,599
frozen yeah uh with 20 gallons of water

724
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:30,200
and so uh what I do is I do a 10 minute

725
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,158
wash and then I let it settle for 10

726
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,120
minutes and then I do so many every wash

727
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,159
I do is a 10minute wash I found that's a

728
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:42,199
pretty nice sweet spot where for one

729
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:44,799
your arms will get tired yes let me tell

730
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,519
you and two it seems to be a good amount

731
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,839
of agitation to you know without

732
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,759
breaking it up too much and totally

733
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:55,319
disintegrating

734
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:57,079
it and that's just something right there

735
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:59,240
you know that's something people as a

736
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,918
wash hash you'll have to learn how hard

737
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,919
to do it I mean people can see my videos

738
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,559
I I put some good work into it but you

739
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,720
know you're trying to that's I don't

740
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:12,800
know how many pounds of water and weed

741
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:17,039
in there that you're trying to you

742
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,960
know get all the heads off so do you

743
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,559
normally grind the weed up before you

744
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,398
start or like just put in full buds no

745
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:28,960
um honestly if it's perfect the perfect

746
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:32,679
way to have it is where you take off all

747
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,760
the fan leaf and trash Leaf um anything

748
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,358
that doesn't have crystals and then you

749
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,599
Buck it up into little like the buds you

750
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:45,119
don't want a giant bud in there you know

751
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:47,800
you want to take it off of the stem um

752
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,679
and the other cuz it's hard cuz you

753
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,519
don't want too many Cuts cuz like I said

754
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,079
every cut in there releases chlorophyll

755
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,440
yes but if you have too big of a bud

756
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,640
you're not going to be be able to get to

757
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,240
the inside of that that makes

758
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,000
sense but if you grind it up too much

759
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,078
then you're going to have way too much

760
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,239
chlorophyll makes a lot more sense some

761
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,519
people too um what I have found is if

762
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:15,358
I've had people bring me Leaf to wash

763
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:17,239
which I hate washing Leaf because it you

764
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,920
have to wash it different you cannot

765
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:22,319
wash Leaf like you wash bud and I think

766
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,400
that's a common mistake some people make

767
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,240
is assuming the instructions for what

768
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,440
people put out there for washing fresh

769
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:33,199
frozen flour is not how you're going to

770
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,800
want to wash your Leaf

771
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:39,439
interesting yeah I didn't know that no

772
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,920
clue it's a little different you got to

773
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,000
it's cuz the material is different it's

774
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,800
really not the same and so people have

775
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,599
washed their Leaf just like the flower

776
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,440
and they end up with a muddled mess like

777
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:54,240
you said when you over agitate you get

778
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,800
too much Leaf material in there cuz you

779
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,159
break it up you know it it mashes in

780
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,800
there even though it's in water and

781
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:03,519
Frozen it'll still break up and if it

782
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,119
gets too small it just passes right

783
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,759
through the bags that makes sense I mean

784
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,358
most of my hash was always like greenish

785
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,359
Brown and like after it was dried it

786
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:16,279
would just snap you know it's not not

787
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,920
not ideal too too much plant material

788
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,280
yeah just a bit just a bit I learned

789
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,760
later you know I got a washing machine

790
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,560
like a like one of those like you know

791
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,440
Chinese made little tiny washing

792
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,239
machines for home and I realized like

793
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,318
how slowly it was agitating stuff and I

794
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:36,279
was like oh oh oh okay so 45 minutes of

795
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:40,119
drill speed probably a little bit

796
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,599
much yes yeah little bit Annihilation

797
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:44,680
man Annihilation dude it it made hash it

798
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,720
made a lot of hash but not much

799
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:51,559
resin in

800
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:52,719
this yeah um so this is really good I I

801
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,400
love this little trunk of the

802
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,358
conversation cuz we just got to hear a

803
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,119
bunch of tips um but did want to draw

804
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,880
out a bit more from you peaches like can

805
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,400
you tell us about what your process is

806
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,440
like now for like the

807
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,358
business uh yeah cuz I definitely had to

808
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:15,639
adjust because well I used to have help

809
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:18,679
washing hash yeah um either bucka and I

810
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:20,480
washed together or we had a couple of uh

811
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:23,639
the friends from the veteran group that

812
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,440
would come help so I had to adjust a lot

813
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:29,799
to coming up here and doing it by myself

814
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,760
um and then wanting people wanting me to

815
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,960
produce a certain amount in a certain

816
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,599
time you know

817
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,079
that's would you mind like taking us

818
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,240
through the process as though you were

819
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,599
like like like in a in a normal workday

820
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:46,078
for you okay yeah so if I was coming in

821
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,760
wash hash the first thing I have to do

822
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,480
is I prep my washroom I got to put all

823
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,119
my equipment together get the air

824
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,519
conditioning running bags ready you want

825
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,760
to wet your bags down so they're not dry

826
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,559
um make sure everything's clean ready to

827
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,359
go um I line my trays with my liner so

828
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:06,960
when I'm ready to scoop they're ready to

829
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:10,598
go

830
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,920
um then let's see I chill my spoons for

831
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:17,400
scooping I always put them in ice and

832
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:20,200
water so they're cold um I fill up my Ig

833
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,838
glue Reservoir with ice and water um and

834
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:26,719
I put ice in my sprayer and then um I

835
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:31,239
take out my fresh Frozen from the

836
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:34,358
freezer and then uh I put it into a 220

837
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:37,559
wash bag inside the bruit with ice and

838
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:40,039
water and then that soaks for 30

839
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:41,920
minutes just sits there and soaks that's

840
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:46,358
what you let it

841
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:49,760
do then uh after that I will do a

842
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:52,920
10minute wash and then I let it settle

843
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,680
for 10 minutes so the hash sifts down

844
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,680
through and collects at the bottom um

845
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:05,318
now at home I used to scoop the bags

846
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:09,919
with every wash um but that's really not

847
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:13,000
time efficient and so now what I do uh

848
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,200
is I have ice in my catch can too I have

849
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,318
ice in the bottom of my catch can and

850
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,799
then I have my bags in there and um I

851
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:24,400
also because we only do full spectrum

852
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,000
hash which is the 70u through the 149 U

853
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,318
I don't have the 120 bag in there I

854
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,358
don't have my 104 bag and I don't have

855
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:35,599
my 90 bag in there I literally do a and

856
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:37,358
I don't catch 25 cuz 25's trash some

857
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,960
people will say whatever but I don't

858
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:47,078
catch 25 I've got my 45 bag my 70 bag my

859
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,119
150 bag the 180 bag and then a 220 bag

860
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,160
cuz I always make sure I put a 220 catch

861
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,039
bag in the top of my bags even though I

862
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,920
wash in a 220 bag that way let's say

863
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,119
your bag rips

864
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,079
yeah something happens and you get

865
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,559
material through then you don't get it

866
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:08,760
into your hash you catch it in that 220

867
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:10,559
bag first yeah um so uh so I let it

868
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,119
settle for 10 minutes and then I drain

869
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:16,400
it and I also keep ice in my 220 bag so

870
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,800
that when it go so I'm trying to keep my

871
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,639
catch can as cold as possible because

872
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:27,240
I'm not going to pull my bags for each

873
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:30,239
wash so I drain it and then I have a

874
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:34,598
trash can reservoir filled with water

875
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:37,279
and I take a like 10 L

876
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:40,640
Glass thing and I Scoop from there and I

877
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,599
fill up my can real quick cuz if I wait

878
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:47,239
for the hose it takes too long cuz I

879
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,880
have a food uh safe drinking water hose

880
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,879
you know MH and um but if I use that to

881
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,240
fill the Can it can take up to 20

882
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,640
minutes to fill the can so I fill my

883
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,598
reservoirs and I have them chilling and

884
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,960
sitting there and so I Scoop from there

885
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,680
I filled the can probably takes a couple

886
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,800
minutes and then I do another 10minute

887
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:10,279
wash M 10 minute settle drain it and

888
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,920
then I repeat the process again and wow

889
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,400
at home I used to do four to five washes

890
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,880
um but at work I do three washes and I'm

891
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,800
done cuz if I

892
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,358
found from my prior experience of

893
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,760
washing and scooping between each wash

894
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:31,400
that as your washes go you get less and

895
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,839
less hash and pretty much by your fist

896
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,880
wash unless you have like some excellent

897
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:38,159
washer you're not getting anything but

898
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,119
stocks you've already gotten the heads

899
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,480
and you'll know that if you've ever

900
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,280
washed and kept your washes separate and

901
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,199
then pressed your washes separate you

902
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,519
can tell that you get less of a return

903
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:55,239
the the farther washes you go

904
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:57,880
out that makes sense I also use a um

905
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:02,598
scope to to scope the weed to make sure

906
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:05,079
the heads are missing um you just a a a

907
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:07,280
bud and I break it open and I scope it

908
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:09,880
and I see like did I get most of the

909
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,519
heads are there stocks missing or you

910
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,800
know then never heard of that that's

911
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:18,280
yeah it's a great tip

912
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,640
yeah y I mean if you don't have a scope

913
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,119
I would the other thing I do is the

914
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:26,838
finger sticky test and uh you just grab

915
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,640
a bud and break it open and feel and if

916
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:31,000
your fingers aren't really sticky then

917
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:35,039
you probably don't have much THC

918
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,199
left um who so my main question is how

919
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,039
are you lifting these heavy

920
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:41,239
bags

921
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,480
u i mean that's pretty heavy though like

922
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:48,000
20 gallons of wet products well it's

923
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,000
really you know the it's really the five

924
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,880
pounds or so of weed that's wet with the

925
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,159
ice in there about 20 lb of ice and

926
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,240
however much 5 lbs of wet weed weighs

927
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,960
it's heavy but I I don't know I I just

928
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,159
do it

929
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,838
cuz I was just thinking about when I

930
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:06,519
used to do it with like even five gallon

931
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:08,000
bags but we didn't have a drain at the

932
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:09,759
bottom so we were lifting the ice and

933
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
the water and that [ __ ] was heavy as

934
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,960
[ __ ] no if I had to lift the water too I

935
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,440
probably couldn't do it yeah yeah no

936
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,599
that would be very heavy that's why I

937
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,679
was like it is heavy plus I'm standing

938
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,760
on a stool so that I'm waiting for my

939
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:26,598
ass to fall off of there I'm not lying

940
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:29,040
yeah oh no get a lad

941
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,000
I well what I want is a Pneumatic table

942
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,000
one that will go to the ground so I can

943
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,679
wash at the ground and then pump it up

944
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,679
and then drain it yeah but I don't have

945
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,759
that so we only have a table so I have

946
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,879
to stand on a little stool to wash hash

947
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,520
oh

948
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,880
no which I don't mind it's it's better

949
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:48,519
than sitting on a ladder they probably

950
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,880
make like cheap foot pump pneumatic

951
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:56,239
Tables by now though I was going to say

952
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,960
like you go sweet oh it's just it's it's

953
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,879
one of those things where it's a it's a

954
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,480
couple hundred expense that we haven't

955
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,358
got to get to yet for sure yeah yeah it

956
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,199
could go to testing it could go to any

957
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:08,639
number of places that's where it's gone

958
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:12,759
as testing I bet which I have to say I'm

959
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:17,159
proud to say I've passed all testing and

960
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:23,240
my coas came in and my rosin tested at

961
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:25,318
over 80% THC wow so I've and just as a

962
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:30,358
side note when when we met up you gave

963
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:32,838
me some um different uh products and I

964
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:35,119
I've had experience with Rosen um but

965
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:38,159
not a lot of experience with like really

966
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,280
professionally well-made rosin and now I

967
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,399
get rosin I did not get rosin at all I

968
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,440
did not understand it why it was so why

969
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,519
it would be a more expensive product why

970
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,960
people preferred it over other types but

971
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,519
that was some exceptional stuff so Props

972
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,079
to you on that wow thank you very much

973
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:58,719
that that really means a lot to me have

974
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,760
worked really hard she won the hash bash

975
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,759
in fact uh for for our server so if that

976
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:08,319
tells you anything

977
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:11,640
yeah yeah really cool should be very

978
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:13,960
proud earlier on you also touched on how

979
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:15,960
important drawing was at home when you

980
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:20,039
were learning what is the drawing

981
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:23,800
process like at work oh it's so much

982
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:25,599
easier um so once I scoop it out I put

983
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,318
it on the freeze dryer trays that are

984
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,079
lined with parchment paper and then you

985
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,318
put those in the freezer to prefreeze

986
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:35,680
cuz they need to be frozen solid before

987
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:38,039
you stick them in the freeze dryer and

988
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:41,039
then um I use the freeze dryer for

989
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:44,358
drying I do uh you do adjust the

990
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,519
temperature down um this is somewhere

991
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:49,440
where I'm going to come in conflict with

992
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:51,239
a lot of people um I've been using the

993
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,159
freeze dryer for a really long time

994
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:55,519
before anybody was even using it for

995
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:59,719
hash that I'm aware of I mean there

996
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:03,440
might have B but um the freeze dryer

997
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:07,598
works through sublimation okay so what

998
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,039
happens is the freeze dryer heats up and

999
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,039
releases the moisture from the product

1000
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:16,558
and the vacuum sucks it up and it sticks

1001
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:19,838
to the drum mhm and that's how things

1002
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,480
get dry and so and and so the freeze

1003
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,920
dryer Cycles through a heat and cooling

1004
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,280
cycle as it does this because your

1005
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,079
product's Frozen in there mhm cuz it

1006
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:33,079
always freezes at

1007
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:35,400
first so when we first started um I

1008
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:37,160
reached out to somebody to ask about hey

1009
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,119
what are you drying your with your

1010
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:42,000
freeze dryer at and all this cuz I had

1011
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:45,160
read that hash needed to be done at a

1012
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,679
different temperature mhm and uh they

1013
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:52,000
told me to run the freeze at

1014
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:56,118
35° and I'm like that's not even out of

1015
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,880
freezing like yeah you know like that's

1016
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:03,200
so I I tried that and I got wet

1017
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:07,480
hash it didn't

1018
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:09,039
dry and so I was like I had already

1019
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,800
thought when they told me that I was

1020
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,199
like that that doesn't sound right

1021
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,920
because it has to heat up to a certain

1022
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:19,439
temperature in order for sublimation to

1023
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,639
occur that's just how science Works um

1024
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,318
so if your product's not defrosting at

1025
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:27,039
all how is it releasing the moisture in

1026
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:30,358
the right amount of time or even at all

1027
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:34,318
I personally set my freeze dryer at

1028
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:37,880
50° because that is warm enough where it

1029
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:40,599
allows sublimation to occur but not so

1030
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:44,079
hot that it affects the color or the

1031
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:46,318
Tarpin or anything like that and you

1032
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,480
know and I just have found better

1033
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:53,159
results I don't ever have wet hash my

1034
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,880
hash is always dry um and so because

1035
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:57,399
you'll see a lot of people who tell you

1036
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,720
oh after you make here rosing uh you

1037
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,680
need to tint it overnight to release the

1038
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:04,838
moisture and that's because you had wet

1039
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:07,078
hash that you pressed because you didn't

1040
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:08,519
sublimate out the moisture during the

1041
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:11,039
freeze drying process because

1042
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,519
everybody's so concerned about color

1043
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:16,679
that they're literally not even really

1044
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:18,920
freeze drying their stuff is that like a

1045
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:23,519
thing in hash where they want just white

1046
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:26,318
hash is that a demand or it is a demand

1047
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:29,079
it's very frustrating because um um a

1048
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:31,440
lot of people will pull early mhm you

1049
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:34,680
know like everybody oh Harvest two weeks

1050
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:38,559
early and you'll have lighter color well

1051
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:41,318
I honestly don't like the taste of hash

1052
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:45,599
rosin that's been pulled early because

1053
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:48,440
anybody who's a grower of any sorts has

1054
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,079
pulled their weed early or lost a branch

1055
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,960
or something along those lines and then

1056
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:56,960
dried it in the oven and smoked it right

1057
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,639
yep okay so we we've all done that if so

1058
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,358
that taste that

1059
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:05,920
weird chlorophyll like taste that comes

1060
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:09,318
with that early harvested weed that's

1061
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,358
not ripe is what you get in your hash

1062
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:15,039
you don't get the Tarpin you just get

1063
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:18,480
that weird flavor yeah I

1064
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:21,279
iric it to me it's an injustice to the

1065
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,719
plant yeah I mean to me it just sounds

1066
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,240
like marketing almost like uh how how

1067
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,679
the customers are driving the genetics

1068
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:32,399
Market by demanding cookies even though

1069
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,279
Growers know that's not an ideal strain

1070
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,960
to grow anymore blah blah blah we've

1071
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,960
kind of all moved on past it but because

1072
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:42,159
the consumer is demanding it it's almost

1073
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:44,599
like nobody can move on yeah

1074
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,639
yeah that makes sense all you know the

1075
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,720
whole color thing came into play with

1076
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:52,239
distillate and

1077
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:54,000
BHO um everybody was all up oh the you

1078
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,399
know you can't have dark distillate and

1079
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,280
dark vho means it's bad and all that and

1080
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,280
then somehow it transferred over to Hash

1081
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,839
yeah and it's kind of ridiculous because

1082
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,119
in my opinion some of the best hash is

1083
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:09,880
made from Su

1084
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:14,480
grown fullterm

1085
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:16,079
weed yeah it's got flavors that you just

1086
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,318
can't get

1087
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:22,200
from does it have bigger

1088
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:25,519
heads you know I mean I haven't I

1089
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,759
haven't exactly examined the difference

1090
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,920
in between uh the heads of indoor and

1091
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,040
outdoor up close sure um I'll have a

1092
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,000
chance to do that this year though I'm

1093
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,759
interested take a look and see if

1094
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,920
there's a difference I just I think it's

1095
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,520
the turpine profile that develops you

1096
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,720
know the sun does something out there

1097
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:45,798
that's how the plant was meant to grow

1098
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,279
yeah

1099
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,000
um and indor makes great hash too I just

1100
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,880
think you need to let it go all the way

1101
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,119
let it do what it's supposed to do let

1102
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,599
those heads get white get a few Amber in

1103
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:01,760
there let it develop the tpin I mean I

1104
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,119
when we grew the blueberry muffin in the

1105
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,760
very beginning it smelled like

1106
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:11,000
pickles and then it turned into this

1107
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:13,760
amazing Jiffy blueberry mix so in a few

1108
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,440
weeks time the turine profile changed so

1109
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,599
imagine if you're pulling 2 weeks early

1110
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,480
the change in the tpin that happens

1111
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,400
during that development like there's a

1112
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,000
surge of all kinds of stuff in that last

1113
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,119
finishing part of flowering and people

1114
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,760
are missing that because they're so hung

1115
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:31,760
up on I want white

1116
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:37,199
rosin that makes that yeah I mean is

1117
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:40,039
there ever any white can you make white

1118
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,039
hash that is completely fully finished

1119
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:45,239
or would it always include some form of

1120
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:48,719
Amber no it's always going to have Amber

1121
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:50,199
because just how the plant is yeah so if

1122
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,239
you're seeing white hash can you

1123
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:55,000
artificially do that is there a case

1124
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:57,598
where people are artificially doing it

1125
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,960
um well a lot of people are passing CRC

1126
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:05,200
off as hash and what's

1127
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,639
CRC the color remediated stuff and it's

1128
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:10,480
not even hash it's actually BHO that's

1129
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:12,920
been run through the color remediation

1130
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,318
thing and they remove all the color and

1131
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:19,680
[ __ ] from it and then they sell it as

1132
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:21,679
hash I didn't even know that was a thing

1133
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,358
remediation they this is a thing that

1134
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,159
they

1135
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:28,558
make oh yeah yeah wow it's to help

1136
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,000
remove you know cuz they first used it

1137
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,359
like with distillate and stuff to help

1138
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,239
remove pesticides or you know stuff from

1139
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,440
the dirty distillate and then people

1140
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:39,118
learned how to do it with BHO and then

1141
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,679
people started saying oh well look at

1142
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,720
this looks like rosin so I'm going to

1143
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:47,399
sell it as Ros even though it's just

1144
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:49,439
treated D yeah that's wild but you know

1145
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,760
what like it's not too far off from what

1146
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,400
I'm seeing in the market with them

1147
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,040
passing off outdoor as indoor in the

1148
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,160
myar bags because you can't really see

1149
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:58,440
it from the outside and I don't know

1150
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:01,000
that the market can identify It Anyways

1151
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,838
either way if they're not Growers like

1152
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,079
even I can have a hard time sometimes

1153
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:07,719
you know like with that with your boss

1154
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:09,680
[ __ ] the other day it was so well grown

1155
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:13,558
and so

1156
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:15,239
loud and you know it the bucket said

1157
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,119
it's like 11 months old so I figured

1158
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:19,679
this has to be just really well dried

1159
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,798
and cured indoor but no it's the density

1160
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,838
everything was so nice on it um I would

1161
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:25,639
have never guessed so yeah I mean the

1162
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,759
stuff I'm seen though is that C off as

1163
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:30,159
outdoor to indoor is nowhere near like

1164
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,880
that it is obviously like oxidized

1165
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:34,879
outdoor

1166
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,160
completely yeah that's a big problem

1167
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,119
with the industry yeah it is and uh you

1168
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:41,719
know like that's another aspect of not

1169
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:42,920
having to deal with corporatocracy

1170
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,879
though that's pretty cool if you guys

1171
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,798
can make it work you know because you

1172
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,720
won't have to play in those games you

1173
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:51,639
don't as a smaller Corporation you don't

1174
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,759
have to um appeal to investors and

1175
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:55,838
people that aren't cannabis people you

1176
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,559
know pushing the rules so that's pretty

1177
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:01,279
cool yep exactly

1178
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:04,720
yeah um I want to flip the question a

1179
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,680
bit um and ask you you know for those of

1180
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:11,000
us at home who we don't really know what

1181
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,199
to look for in Hesh um in terms of

1182
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,119
you've talked quite a bit about the

1183
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:16,759
process and we just are now starting to

1184
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:20,119
talk about the end product so in your

1185
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:22,960
opinion you know how can we know when

1186
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:25,760
hash is good in your opinion what's what

1187
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,039
makes good hash um in terms of the

1188
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,559
actual product are you talking visually

1189
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:31,318
or smoking just to break it down for her

1190
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:33,640
a little further those things so

1191
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:35,400
basically once hash has arrived in your

1192
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:37,558
hands in some form and you don't know

1193
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,280
anything about the process how do you

1194
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,280
judge that it's

1195
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:48,199
good

1196
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:52,280
H well I would say my first thing would

1197
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:55,639
be just uh I always smell it first to

1198
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:58,440
see what it smells like um yeah

1199
00:54:55,639 --> 00:55:01,440
I don't I don't ever judge by color

1200
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:04,480
because uh you

1201
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,159
know I already explain that part yeah um

1202
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,318
but yeah

1203
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:13,078
um I would say it's upon smoking it like

1204
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:17,000
um if it's live rosin then you know you

1205
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:21,920
want it to uh have a good melt in your

1206
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,280
bowl and not um crackle or anything like

1207
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,798
that cuz if it crackles or something

1208
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,920
that means it has more moisture in it

1209
00:55:27,798 --> 00:55:33,440
um

1210
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,000
uh and then and then I go by The Taste

1211
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,920
when I when I smoke it how it tastes um

1212
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,519
cuz I can't stand that early harvested

1213
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,240
taste cuz it to me it's just this weird

1214
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:47,880
I don't even know how to describe it

1215
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:51,439
it's just a weird coating flavor um so

1216
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:53,720
uh I also look for like if the tpin coat

1217
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,280
your mouth that's also a good sign of a

1218
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:57,919
nice hash because you get get that where

1219
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,680
you you know for a couple minutes

1220
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,880
afterwards you can actually taste it on

1221
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:04,358
your palette and you're like yeah you're

1222
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:08,039
like hm what was that that's what what

1223
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:10,000
are these flavors that are happening um

1224
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,680
now if it's like the full melt you want

1225
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,639
to put it on a you know bowl and melt

1226
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:17,639
that and see if it actually Bubbles and

1227
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:20,239
melts down and does all that nice

1228
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:22,519
gooiness into your bowl you

1229
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:25,318
know now you

1230
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:26,798
mentioning you go M no I was going to

1231
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:29,480
ask there's there's a few terms you use

1232
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,400
like live rosin live can you explain

1233
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,079
that term because I think it's very

1234
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:38,079
misunderstood even by

1235
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:40,680
me so live rosin means that uh they cut

1236
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,920
the plant when they cut the plant down

1237
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:46,719
uh they bucked it up and immediately

1238
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:49,559
froze it within like you know 20 to 30

1239
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:53,838
minutes of it being cut off the plant

1240
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:57,200
it's put into a bag like the way uh we

1241
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:59,480
did it was we got dry ice and we put in

1242
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:01,118
the ice chest and then we put a bag in

1243
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,920
there cuz you don't want your weed to

1244
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,838
come in contact with dry ice ever

1245
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,079
because dry ice is manufactured with

1246
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:11,358
chemicals and so it has chemical

1247
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,318
residues on it so dry ice can be used

1248
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:15,400
for stuff but you don't ever want your

1249
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:17,038
stuff to come in contact with it and so

1250
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,720
you put the bag in there and then as

1251
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,400
you're trimming the weed um like we

1252
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:24,078
would chop the plant down and hang it

1253
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,358
upside down and then just start de

1254
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,119
leafing and then you take the buds and

1255
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:29,880
you chop those up and as you're chopping

1256
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:31,240
them up you're dropping them into the

1257
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:36,000
bag and they're

1258
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:38,598
freezing and um the way we do it is we

1259
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,960
put it in the turkey bag first because

1260
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:42,720
if you you don't want a vacuum sealing

1261
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,838
because when you vacuum seal it you

1262
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,959
smash everything and they're going to

1263
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:48,679
stick together and you're smashing tric

1264
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,679
Combs and all that so you just want it

1265
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:52,719
packed Loosely in a bag if you want to

1266
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:55,358
put it in a vacuum seal bag you can but

1267
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,679
don't vacuum seal it just seal it and

1268
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,519
then it goes straight into a freezer and

1269
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,639
that's where it stays until it gets

1270
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:06,038
washed and that's what makes it live

1271
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,679
rosin so how does that differ from fresh

1272
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:11,319
frozen that's the same fresh Frozen

1273
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:14,440
whole plant fresh frozen is what makes

1274
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:16,318
live rosin gotcha gotcha I've always

1275
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,318
wondered what live meant like if they

1276
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,719
were keeping the plant in the pot and

1277
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,358
like lifting it over to the press and

1278
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:25,199
like smashing it like that's what I

1279
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:27,558
thought it meant I didn't know like I've

1280
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,038
seen the new term like living diamonds

1281
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:32,240
and I'm like living now this is taking

1282
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:35,440
it a step further like not just alive in

1283
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:37,959
a pot like I thought but living diamonds

1284
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,480
does this have you ever heard this term

1285
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,679
that that's a new one for

1286
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,400
me I don't know like are they still

1287
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:47,440
growing in there they should be growing

1288
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,240
in my jar by the way it sounds I don't

1289
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,200
know I mean I've made solventless

1290
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,159
diamonds but I wouldn't say they were

1291
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:57,480
anywhere close to living and I I made

1292
00:58:55,159 --> 00:59:00,078
them with live rosin but I wouldn't say

1293
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:03,280
they were living like yeah going from

1294
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,680
live to living is is a Le is a it is a

1295
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,519
leap a little bit you know like

1296
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,719
something's inferred and implied and the

1297
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:12,639
other is like why you're

1298
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:14,239
alive I don't know I just I I remember

1299
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:17,440
um some of the first people I saw using

1300
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:18,838
the term live resin was over in Colorado

1301
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,838
I can't remember who it was it was one

1302
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:23,078
of the um it's one of those guys R

1303
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,199
Pritchard or one of those dudes but yeah

1304
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:27,119
it was it was very interesting um

1305
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,358
watching that come up and then like

1306
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,880
people gate keep over that term and

1307
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,318
saying oh no that's really not what it

1308
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,559
is this is what it is you know like

1309
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,920
people redefining it as it went so I was

1310
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,680
always kind of interested where the

1311
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:44,639
definition ended up Landing in the end

1312
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:46,879
yeah yeah um I also did want to

1313
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:47,838
like just summarize some of what you

1314
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,079
said

1315
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:53,759
about how you evaluate um hash and you

1316
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,359
and kind of like what man has has said

1317
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,079
about flowers as well like you can't

1318
00:59:56,358 --> 01:00:02,038
really judge it based purely on its

1319
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:04,240
visuals like you were saying um too much

1320
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:06,119
variability too much diversity you can't

1321
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:07,959
really tell that something's good based

1322
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,920
purely on how it looks I was just

1323
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,559
curious about one other quality um can

1324
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,720
you tell anything from how pliable or

1325
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:17,519
not the hashes is is is there does that

1326
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:22,000
mean

1327
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:24,798
anything um well if it there that would

1328
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,798
be the the stuff that's a little less

1329
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:30,559
pliable is what people refer to as fresh

1330
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:32,960
press um it's what comes right off the

1331
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:36,599
press but then it also depends on

1332
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,920
strains um yeah every strain is

1333
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:41,599
different uh when it comes to washing

1334
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,599
and then the texture you get at the end

1335
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,798
of the hash uh every strain has a total

1336
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:50,880
different effect there's some strains

1337
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:51,880
that are very creamy texture like um and

1338
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,960
then there's ones that are almost

1339
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,720
shatter

1340
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:59,318
like uh yeah

1341
01:00:55,719 --> 01:01:01,919
mhm so it's it's hard to judge off the

1342
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:07,440
texture as far as if it's a good quality

1343
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:10,240
or not um yeah I I yeah I I would agree

1344
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,280
too because like I've had with what

1345
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,719
little hash experience I have because I

1346
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,880
I'm such a noob to Hash other than like

1347
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:18,480
smoking like bubble hash and like finger

1348
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,358
hash you know like going into the

1349
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,960
diamonds and all that stuff I'm fairly a

1350
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:24,798
noob and so I remember making shatter

1351
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,119
back in the day in San Diego and being

1352
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:29,199
you know like I know what that tastes

1353
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:30,920
like and seeing all these other hashes

1354
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:32,960
come out that look like they're just

1355
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,920
gooey tricomes I assume that shatter

1356
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,798
would be the subpar stuff now especially

1357
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,000
because it's so cheap now but like the

1358
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:42,318
other day I haven't seen shatter that's

1359
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,039
just as tasty as anything else whereas

1360
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,279
like mentally I'm thinking it's cheaper

1361
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:49,039
it must not be as good but I don't even

1362
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,039
know if that's the

1363
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:55,000
case do you have any opinions on that

1364
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:59,039
one with shatter versus any of the other

1365
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,480
sorts you know cuz the texture doesn't

1366
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:04,000
necessarily have to do with the quality

1367
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:07,400
as it well it in some cases it does cuz

1368
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,119
like I know that if um when we were

1369
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,798
messing around back in the day when we

1370
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:15,838
would press some older weed like that

1371
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:18,639
was been cured and older back when we

1372
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:22,199
were doing the flower rosin thing um

1373
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:25,920
stuff from older weed came out more

1374
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:28,519
shatter likee like it didn't want to get

1375
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,318
creamy it didn't want to

1376
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:34,639
um have any but kind of texture but just

1377
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:38,318
to make a mess like literally like glass

1378
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:40,798
and so uh I don't know if BHO is along

1379
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:43,318
those same factors where you know maybe

1380
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:46,599
something that's older has a tendency to

1381
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:49,759
not have those uh maybe the fats and

1382
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:52,559
lipids that bind it together so

1383
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,720
much so you're getting something that's

1384
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:57,839
you know a totally different different

1385
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:01,038
texture and that glass light

1386
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:02,400
texture if that makes sense it's just so

1387
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,880
interesting to me because like if you

1388
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,480
smell shatter like you're not getting a

1389
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,318
ton of scent off it even some of like

1390
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,760
the dried rosin I don't get a ton of

1391
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:11,599
scent off it but when you smoke it it's

1392
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:14,480
like full flavor everything's there and

1393
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,599
like it's all new experience to me you

1394
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,559
know I love it I love learning all this

1395
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:22,039
stuff what I don't like is like

1396
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:23,480
dispensary typical dispensary stuff

1397
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:25,119
because you just never know what kind of

1398
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,480
Mystery

1399
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,838
magic you're getting especially when

1400
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:32,559
it's like black market dispensaries and

1401
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:34,798
stuff that's true yeah yeah for

1402
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:38,599
sure

1403
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:41,159
um you touched on this a little bit

1404
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:45,838
Peach but I did want to know what your

1405
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:45,838
favorite plants or strains were for

1406
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,599
extracts the first one that comes in my

1407
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:53,278
head is strawberry

1408
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:55,440
banana she's a

1409
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:58,519
dream

1410
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,200
she washes well and uh retains the

1411
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:06,000
tarpine profile very well makes a great

1412
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:09,960
textured rosin um just a a really good

1413
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,679
one um a couple other that I've washed

1414
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,278
that were good washers were uh grapes

1415
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:18,598
and

1416
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:20,798
cream uh that one M produced over

1417
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:23,000
5% do you know what the lineage of that

1418
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:23,000
one

1419
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:28,439
is no honestly I do not probably an

1420
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:31,318
exotic mic one I'm

1421
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:34,318
guessing with and cream you know like

1422
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:36,038
cookies and cream type stuff yeah yep

1423
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:38,558
and he stole strawberry cream in put

1424
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:40,680
made it strawberries and cream [ __ ]

1425
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,160
okay that so that's two any any others

1426
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:48,038
that you

1427
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:51,598
like um Oreos was a good washer for me

1428
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:51,599
um uh let's

1429
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:58,880
see the Doughboy didn't do bad at all

1430
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:01,598
either I hate washing gelato okay yeah

1431
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:05,278
let's flip it what are the worst ones

1432
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:08,798
what are the worst ones gelato okay it's

1433
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:12,519
not just me fellas no what I've found

1434
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:15,239
with gelato is it has very thin

1435
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:17,119
membranes THC membrane heads you know

1436
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,879
cuz that's part of what when you wash

1437
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,960
hash you want something that the the

1438
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:24,720
membrane of the THC head is kind of

1439
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,079
durable so can

1440
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:33,639
deal with the washing without shattering

1441
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:36,200
yes so gelato likes to those heads

1442
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:38,558
shatter really easy and so what happens

1443
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:41,000
when you wash gelato is not only are

1444
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:44,480
there not very many heads but the heads

1445
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,760
that there are shatter and so you end up

1446
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,960
with like a sticky mess in your

1447
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:54,200
bags um cuz you know when it's a Sandy

1448
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,440
resin it collects in a bundle and it's

1449
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:58,118
down there in the water and it's

1450
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:01,159
swirling around but when it the head

1451
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:02,720
shatter like that they just want to

1452
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:05,038
stick in your bag and you can't get them

1453
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:07,199
out like even with the coldest spray

1454
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,278
water they'll still stick in your bag

1455
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:14,519
screen and it's just maddening because

1456
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:16,480
it's a mess and you lose THC and like

1457
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:19,798
it's just not fun cuz there's hardly

1458
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,079
anything left when you scoop um except

1459
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:24,599
for some fats and lipids and a little

1460
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,599
bit of THC um

1461
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:31,640
the other one besides that I have to say

1462
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:33,278
now um I don't know whose train wreck it

1463
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:36,038
was but it was a train wreck that was

1464
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:39,599
grown by a friend of ours that it was a

1465
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:45,000
horrible washer interesting um yeah we

1466
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:45,000
washed five lbs of it and got seven

1467
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:51,440
gr wait five PBS and you got seven

1468
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:54,159
grams absolutely horrible cuz when we

1469
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:58,358
washed 5 lbs of strawberry banana we got

1470
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:59,318
over two ounces of rosin back oh wow

1471
01:06:58,358 --> 01:07:02,038
yeah that's

1472
01:06:59,318 --> 01:07:04,759
horrible so that that that's a

1473
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:07,720
comparison for you from over 2 oz of

1474
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:09,278
rosin to 7 gram of the same amount of

1475
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:11,759
flour

1476
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:14,400
washed so and that would be purely

1477
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,200
because of its heads for whatever

1478
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,519
reason uh yeah you know or it could be

1479
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:22,759
how it was grown I mean um somebody else

1480
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:25,759
might grow a train wreck that you know

1481
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:28,000
washes better I'm not not sure but um it

1482
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:31,200
has to do a lot of factors it's you know

1483
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,079
it can go back from to the The Strain

1484
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:37,679
itself and the structure of its heads

1485
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:40,480
how it releases them how much THC it has

1486
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:42,358
and then you go to the grower and that

1487
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,039
person has to you know grow it right and

1488
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,719
treat it right cuz otherwise it's not

1489
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:47,960
going to be very good just like flow

1490
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:50,598
it's the same thing if you don't put

1491
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:53,278
that love and time and attention into it

1492
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:56,798
you're not going to get Hash Hash is

1493
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:58,519
only as good good as what's put into it

1494
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,079
yeah it's kind of like what mat and I

1495
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:02,559
were talking about a little bit In The

1496
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:05,920
Name Game episode

1497
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:07,680
where the plant when you're when you're

1498
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,119
like processing the plant there just so

1499
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:14,118
many different points of which you could

1500
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:15,920
mess it up really um or different points

1501
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:17,920
at which you could change something

1502
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:22,079
quite quite majorly Without Really

1503
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:25,119
knowing um yeah yeah I'm I'm excited to

1504
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,798
see how uh The Punchy washes did you

1505
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:28,798
you've gotten to smell all the the

1506
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:31,838
examples now

1507
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:34,000
right yes I did I'm excited about that

1508
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:36,359
Punchy one cuz it had some really good

1509
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
flavor and I'd be interested to see if

1510
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:40,759
that gets to come through the wash and

1511
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,838
into the hash itself actually fingers

1512
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:47,880
crossed yeah yeah nice shout out to the

1513
01:08:44,838 --> 01:08:49,960
uh Punchy bloster yeah oh um we have the

1514
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,400
review going up tonight so you know

1515
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,798
anybody watching this video can go back

1516
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:54,838
and check out the reviews of the same

1517
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,479
samples that she's talking about right

1518
01:08:54,838 --> 01:09:00,039
now yeah it'll be like a week in the

1519
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:03,519
past now but yes yes people can check

1520
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:06,319
that out um okay well I did want to

1521
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,480
round out some of the tick side and I

1522
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,199
wanted to kind of bring it back to

1523
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:10,919
people who make hash at home and just

1524
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:13,519
want want to kind of maybe ask you a

1525
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:16,679
difficult question which is

1526
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,319
like from all your experience you know

1527
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:21,920
what would be some of your like top tips

1528
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:23,400
for people making hash at home you've

1529
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,158
sort of touched on a little bit of this

1530
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:27,719
already uh so don't don't worry about

1531
01:09:25,158 --> 01:09:29,679
repeating yourself but you know what are

1532
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:31,198
the stages and what are the techniques

1533
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:34,719
to focus

1534
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:37,960
on um well if you're at home you know I

1535
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:40,079
have made some bomb hash in my kitchen

1536
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:43,759
without a cold room you know everybody

1537
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:46,719
says you have to have a cold room and um

1538
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:48,640
it does help um I'm not going to lie but

1539
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,560
if you're at home you know wait till

1540
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:55,360
night time and turn on your

1541
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:59,600
AC so it's cooler in there um

1542
01:09:55,359 --> 01:10:04,198
the other thing would be uh have

1543
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:06,640
a an Igloo cooler you know like you put

1544
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:08,919
water in like uh construction guys use

1545
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,679
them all the time they're drinking water

1546
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:14,158
safe so you get yourself an Eglo cool

1547
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:16,719
cooler and you fill that up with ice and

1548
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:19,359
water and then you have your pump

1549
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:21,640
sprayer and you fill that up with ice

1550
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:25,039
and when you're going to scoop your bags

1551
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:27,199
and rinse you make sure you fill your

1552
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:29,000
sprayer that's full of ice with the ice

1553
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:31,678
water from that Igloo

1554
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,439
because the main important thing when

1555
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,880
collecting your hash and doing the whole

1556
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:40,000
hash process is keeping things cold and

1557
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:44,719
so at home you're battling not having a

1558
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,198
cold room and so having your uh spray

1559
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:50,840
water chilled and ready having your

1560
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:54,279
sprayer cold is essential and then um I

1561
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:56,719
have found um by putting ice in the

1562
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:59,519
bottom of my catch can under the bags

1563
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,399
like in the bottom where the water goes

1564
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,560
and then in my 220 bag in the top I'll

1565
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:10,839
put ice in there too cuz that'll help

1566
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:15,159
keep your catch can cold yeah um mhm and

1567
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:18,360
then I would say make sure you

1568
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:21,719
um soak your or put your Scoops and ice

1569
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:24,238
water so they're nice and cold

1570
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:26,319
um the using the two

1571
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:29,319
220s make sure you you know you wash in

1572
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:32,799
your wash bag 220 and then use a catch

1573
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:37,279
220 um and

1574
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:39,880
then um at home you do have to I do not

1575
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:42,519
recommend doing several washes in them

1576
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:45,760
pulling at home you're going to want to

1577
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:48,520
do your 10minute wash with and and this

1578
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:51,360
would vary I mean if you've got a

1579
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:53,159
small setup like a one gallon you're

1580
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:54,439
going to want to wash for 5 minutes not

1581
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:56,638
10

1582
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:58,319
right you know that it IT sizes up as

1583
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:00,760
you go so you don't because you don't

1584
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:04,000
want to overwash and I think sometimes a

1585
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:06,440
lot of people um overwash more than they

1586
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,800
underwash and so at home you're going to

1587
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:10,238
want to do your wash and your settle and

1588
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,880
your drain and then you're going to want

1589
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:18,479
to collect your bags and then um repeat

1590
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:21,039
the process after that and so as and

1591
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,839
that's how when you collect those bags

1592
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:24,800
you look and see how much hash you're

1593
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:28,079
getting in there

1594
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,719
and then after each wash you evaluate

1595
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:33,840
those scoops of hash

1596
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:37,198
and that's how you can determine for

1597
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,039
yourself how many washes you want to do

1598
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,519
like I said at home sometimes I would do

1599
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:44,560
four or five washes where at work I do

1600
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,600
three and I'm done trying to get it you

1601
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,199
know through the cycles so at home I

1602
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,880
would recommend you know as you scoop

1603
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,439
you know use your intuition if you look

1604
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,840
like you're still getting a good amount

1605
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:56,799
in there then go another wash but if

1606
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,119
it's like a minuscule amount and you're

1607
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:03,600
like I don't know if it's worth all that

1608
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:03,599
hassle then it's time to call it quits

1609
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:12,238
there those are really good tips um

1610
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,119
anything on the drying at home or yeah

1611
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:16,119
any tips for like how we know people

1612
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:17,479
don't have a freeze dryer obviously so

1613
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:21,399
what what's the next best thing people

1614
01:13:17,479 --> 01:13:23,879
can do um well the the they want to you

1615
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:25,920
know use the Micron screen

1616
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,840
and just like we did back in the day

1617
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:32,279
with the um put it on the cardboard so

1618
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,159
it pulls out the moisture and then um

1619
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:36,519
keep

1620
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:38,719
it covered in the refrigerator so it

1621
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:41,760
doesn't oxidize too much but it still

1622
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,760
will you know release the moisture and

1623
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,800
uh do all that and then there's the

1624
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,480
whole micro planing it after that and

1625
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,000
then letting it dry some more on the

1626
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,839
screens

1627
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,600
um that's the best thing you can you can

1628
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,880
do and if you don't care about color

1629
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,840
then you don't have to worry about the

1630
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:02,199
air too much um and most people who are

1631
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:05,199
drying air dry anyways aren't too

1632
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:06,559
worried about color cuz it's already

1633
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:09,039
going to be a little darker because of

1634
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,639
the air drying unfortunately air is the

1635
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:16,960
enemy of hash so yeah um

1636
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:19,119
yeah okay I had one one last one on

1637
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,520
people for people at home which

1638
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,880
is um in terms of the actual process of

1639
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:28,199
washing or agitating you know what what

1640
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:30,119
is your like ideal for someone at

1641
01:14:28,198 --> 01:14:33,759
home

1642
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:39,158
um well I would not use a electric mixer

1643
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:41,639
of any sort or a drill no drills no um

1644
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:44,079
you can buy you know you can either buy

1645
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:46,800
a whisk at the store some people like to

1646
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:48,600
use whisk um The Kitchen Store is a

1647
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,840
great place to go or like the restaurant

1648
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:53,760
supply store uh to you don't mean like a

1649
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:56,840
hand whisk right like a machine whisk no

1650
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,800
well no they're like like bigger whisk

1651
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,319
um well it depends on the size of your

1652
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,760
buckets like if you're using a one

1653
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:04,559
gallon and yeah you could use a little

1654
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,320
hand whisk no problem and I would say

1655
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:11,719
like I say a five a five minute

1656
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:13,158
agitation on that on a on a little one

1657
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:15,039
gallon bucket now if you're going to go

1658
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:18,000
to a 5 gallon bucket you could probably

1659
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:19,760
do a 10minute and be totally fine and I

1660
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,800
mean you're not going to want to beat

1661
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,480
the hell out of it but you got to try to

1662
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,079
push the water through the buds so

1663
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:30,119
you're going to want to wash it I mean

1664
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:32,079
if you've ever watched a washing machine

1665
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:34,238
you know like not the new ones that

1666
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:37,000
don't have the thing but you know old

1667
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:39,359
school ones that spun you know that's if

1668
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,840
you've watched any hash machine on

1669
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:46,279
Instagram run you can see

1670
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:48,800
how it it it does push stuff through

1671
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:51,840
it's not too gentle of a process but

1672
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,639
it's also you know it's it's a learning

1673
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,880
process you can tell people and that's

1674
01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:58,279
what I find is people a lot of times

1675
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:02,000
somebody told me they washed for 25

1676
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:04,079
minutes and I'm like why 25 minutes

1677
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,039
straight and how many times and he was

1678
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,639
like four times and I was like oh no no

1679
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,158
that's totally

1680
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:14,359
unnecessary you know cuz you're you know

1681
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:18,279
you don't want to beat the hell out of

1682
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:20,479
stuff yeah so um I can I can verify you

1683
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:22,719
don't want to beat the hell out of

1684
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:26,319
stuff because you have to remember the

1685
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:29,439
longer it's in the water the it if your

1686
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:32,679
product's Frozen it's defrosting and

1687
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:35,519
what you'll see is as it defrost it will

1688
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:38,440
start to release chlorophyll more and so

1689
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,239
once that starts to happen is when you

1690
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:42,559
you know you don't want to be washing

1691
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:45,559
forever because you're trying to do it

1692
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:48,280
in a short amount of time before that

1693
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,360
weed gets so saturated it's a sloppy

1694
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:54,960
mess

1695
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:57,519
yeah thanks nice thank you

1696
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,600
so many um gems that you've dropped

1697
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,800
already um I'm going to have to rewatch

1698
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,520
this a few times just yeah just to get

1699
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,400
some of this down I know a lot of it

1700
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:08,600
seems basic but I am so basic when it

1701
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:10,238
comes to Hash making I I will need to

1702
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:13,719
yeah because I'm I'm going to do a round

1703
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:15,718
soon I think um so I'm gonna try and try

1704
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:19,600
and absorb as much of this as

1705
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:22,279
possible um we wanted to maybe do a

1706
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,800
little uh tangent away from from the

1707
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:26,599
hash for a moment

1708
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,600
and ask you about your

1709
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:32,678
Edibles

1710
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:35,600
yeah I don't have no way to begin I mean

1711
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:39,639
did Matt get to try anything I did I got

1712
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:42,199
to try a bunch and um you know I'm not a

1713
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:44,279
big edible person I love the FL flavor

1714
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:46,158
of cannabis and stuff but I've always

1715
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:48,399
found it's either like my friends have

1716
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,359
put like you know 10 grams into a

1717
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:51,799
brownie of hash and I'll just be total

1718
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:54,079
for three days or I just don't get

1719
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,239
affected too much but these were really

1720
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:59,479
nice man and it wasn't just like the

1721
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:01,479
effect it was the actual flavor the

1722
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:02,519
things I'd never seen before and and I

1723
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:04,238
don't know if you want to talk about

1724
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,120
like some of the milk dads stuff like

1725
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:08,198
that that that are very unique and and

1726
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:11,960
just

1727
01:18:08,198 --> 01:18:14,479
amazing well um you know I've I've been

1728
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:17,119
doing Edibles since we've been doing

1729
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:20,000
weed um at first I did you know

1730
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:24,000
caramel's cookies and all that stuff um

1731
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,880
but when we got the freeze dryer um

1732
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,560
bakashot came to me and he's like hey

1733
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,960
have you seen or ever heard of

1734
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,840
freeze-dried Skittles and I'm like of

1735
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,679
course not like I don't know anything

1736
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,360
about the freeze dryer yet we just got

1737
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:39,880
it I'm reading the book here and it

1738
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:42,079
talks about you know you can do ice

1739
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:44,119
cream and I'm like I remember space you

1740
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:46,279
know actually not ice cream from school

1741
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:50,399
I remember that and that's obviously

1742
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:53,238
what this is and he's like

1743
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:55,000
dude like we should look into freeze dry

1744
01:18:53,238 --> 01:18:59,279
candies and I was

1745
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:02,719
like okay so we started with hash and

1746
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:05,279
then I threw in some Skittles and

1747
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:09,679
figured out how to medicate them and it

1748
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:11,198
was kind of over from there yeah I bet I

1749
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,880
started doing all kinds of stuff I

1750
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:16,000
learned you know in my opinion if a

1751
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:18,440
candy like there's certain candies that

1752
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,439
don't work mik and I don't work

1753
01:19:18,439 --> 01:19:24,198
chocolate doesn't freeze dry peanut

1754
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:26,319
butter doesn't freeze dry um

1755
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:29,839
there's certain candies that just don't

1756
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:31,960
want to do things others do you know

1757
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:35,319
it's just a matter like licorice just

1758
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:37,119
gets hard and it's and and I I only do

1759
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:39,119
candies that change into a texture

1760
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:41,238
that's appealing like to me if it just

1761
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:44,079
freees and gets hard that doesn't mean

1762
01:19:41,238 --> 01:19:46,599
it's actually worth it yeah

1763
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:48,920
exactly so it was a lot of trial and

1764
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,800
error with things

1765
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:53,039
um but uh so yeah I started doing the

1766
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,560
freeze dryed candies cuz because I

1767
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:57,039
wanted to have something that nobody

1768
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,159
else had on the market everybody has the

1769
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:01,880
same Edibles everybody's got gummies

1770
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:06,399
they do brownies they do all the you

1771
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:09,440
know the same sh lollipops yeah yes and

1772
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:12,799
so go ahead I have a I have a

1773
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:15,960
provocation here um which is I'm someone

1774
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,679
who's like why mix food and the you know

1775
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:21,639
and cannabis why not just keep them

1776
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:23,800
separate make good candy sure but why

1777
01:20:21,639 --> 01:20:26,920
why mix them like what's the

1778
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,679
point well because consuming cannabis

1779
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:31,119
has a totally different

1780
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:33,279
effect and

1781
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:36,439
um there are some people who don't like

1782
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:39,559
to smoke and some people who can't smoke

1783
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:42,799
uh people with COPD and things like that

1784
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:45,520
that can't actually you know smoke

1785
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,560
cannabis can use it and consume it and

1786
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:52,760
get the benefits from it by eating

1787
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:54,400
it and um and people eat it at work and

1788
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,560
do it in front of everyone they have

1789
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:59,679
nobody has any clue it's nice and sneaky

1790
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:03,880
you know yeah that's that's one of

1791
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:05,600
things to me yeah sorry you go paches um

1792
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,880
I like the Edibles to be able to sleep

1793
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,520
at night like when I travel and stuff

1794
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,560
and I'm not going to get a good at night

1795
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,120
sleep that's when I like to use Edibles

1796
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,400
cuz I honestly as much as I love making

1797
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:20,000
Edibles I hate the taste to we with a

1798
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:22,759
passion like it'll almost make me puke I

1799
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,639
love it I love it so much stand it

1800
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:28,679
that's funny cuz you make such good

1801
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:30,520
stuff with it it's unreal oh you should

1802
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:33,639
see my face there's times when I've made

1803
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:38,960
brownies right and I like out of habit

1804
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:42,119
lick my finger and be so sorry oh my God

1805
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:44,439
so sorry that I did that because I just

1806
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:47,198
I can't stand the taste of it but the

1807
01:21:44,439 --> 01:21:51,519
thing about my Edibles I like is they

1808
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:53,799
don't have that overwhelming weed flavor

1809
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:56,000
that I can't get past I mean I've had

1810
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,960
Edibles we bought back in the day that I

1811
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,158
literally couldn't eat I was like I

1812
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,960
can't I'm going to puke like I bet and

1813
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:06,039
so part of my goal was to create Edibles

1814
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,198
that not were only unique in style but

1815
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:10,519
didn't have such a strong flavor that

1816
01:22:08,198 --> 01:22:12,359
maybe people want to eat them and that

1817
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,679
was part of the feedback I've got from

1818
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:16,880
people is that they do enjoy my Edibles

1819
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:19,679
because they're not such an overwhelming

1820
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,639
weed flavor that they can't actually

1821
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:24,399
enjoy

1822
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:27,440
it yeah I know my my chick was doing

1823
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:29,679
literal dances as she ate your cucumbers

1824
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:31,479
your your uh freeze-dried cucumbers and

1825
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:33,239
they had like Dill on them and stuff so

1826
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:35,759
they were kind of pickly yeah they were

1827
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:38,000
like pickle chip they were she is so in

1828
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:41,159
love with those things so you even make

1829
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,880
healthy items too now that um are as

1830
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:47,039
well yes that was one of my goals too is

1831
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:50,239
um one I don't think you should have to

1832
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:53,880
eat 1,000 calories to get high yeah it's

1833
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:57,439
not right Point um can is supposed to be

1834
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:02,319
medicine and a lot of people are using

1835
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:04,919
um it for for illnesses and for cancer

1836
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,719
and we all know sugar feeds a lot of

1837
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:10,319
cancers and

1838
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:11,880
so when I developed my edible line the

1839
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:15,198
one there's several things I kept in

1840
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:17,560
mind one was serving size none of my

1841
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,359
bags of candy are more than a serving of

1842
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:23,120
candy yeah you don't have to eat two

1843
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:26,359
whole bags of Skittles to get high yeah

1844
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:28,079
you get 25 Skittles in a bag which is

1845
01:23:26,359 --> 01:23:30,319
the serving size of one of those little

1846
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:31,960
bags of Skittles that you would get and

1847
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:35,000
that's what you get same thing with all

1848
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:37,639
the other candies it's not a huge

1849
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,279
serving and then I also wanted to do

1850
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:44,480
healthy ones so that somebody who can't

1851
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:46,599
eat candy like me yeah yes can have a

1852
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:49,678
fruit and I just started doing the

1853
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,800
vegetables recently um but I've been

1854
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:54,600
doing fruit for a long time because to

1855
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:57,480
me that was like you can put it in

1856
01:23:54,600 --> 01:24:00,039
yogurt you can put it in a smoothie um

1857
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:03,638
you can eat it straight I mean it's

1858
01:24:00,039 --> 01:24:07,279
great and it's healthy like you you can

1859
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:10,199
consume it and not feel guilty yeah and

1860
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:11,960
for somebody who's a cancer patient and

1861
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:15,719
they want to consume a certain amount of

1862
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:17,760
cannabis a day um I think it's important

1863
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:18,560
for somebody to have a healthy choice to

1864
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,079
do

1865
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:23,000
that yeah absolutely and and like you

1866
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:25,399
said ingestions actually the strongest

1867
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,079
way to take in cannabis in the first

1868
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:30,799
place so if someone has like a serious

1869
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:32,198
serious pain management issue like maybe

1870
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,960
like trying to sit there and smoke

1871
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:35,719
joints every 10 minutes it's going to be

1872
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,239
a bit much on their lungs so yeah you

1873
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:42,920
can eat one hash Brownie and be toasted

1874
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:45,238
for a few days and be good you know

1875
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:47,760
yep yeah I think you should be really

1876
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:49,079
proud of those um the the healthy items

1877
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,880
that you have too because you just I

1878
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:53,840
don't really see that in dispensaries or

1879
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,199
Collective too often where you're seeing

1880
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,079
like like cucumber chips and stuff

1881
01:24:56,198 --> 01:25:01,479
that's that was really really out of the

1882
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:05,000

1893
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,239
that's part of the other cool thing

1894
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:36,519
about some of the freeze-dried things is

1895
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:38,959
stuff that like people who have teeth

1896
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:42,199
problems um yes you know some people

1897
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,600
can't eat salt water taffy anymore uh

1898
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:46,158
any kind of Taffy and when you freeze

1899
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,840
just you know like the caramel inside

1900
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:52,319
the milk that is it puffs up and it

1901
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:55,760
becomes that crunchy ball of goodness

1902
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:58,118
and So like um saltwater taffy does the

1903
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,000
same thing wow it puffs into a little

1904
01:25:58,118 --> 01:26:02,399
ball and so it just melts in your mouth

1905
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,760
and so people who can't eat those things

1906
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:07,679
anymore can now eat them in a and

1907
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,440
experience that same flavor just in a

1908
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:11,239
different way and experience without

1909
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:14,079
losing a tooth or messing up their

1910
01:26:11,238 --> 01:26:16,359

1912
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:19,719
since I was young so like that's a

1913
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:20,799
serious consider like hard candies and

1914
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:21,719
stuff like that I don't even mess with

1915
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,039
it because I don't want to knock out

1916
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:27,118
teeth or anything crazy but yeah these

1917

hash section but I also thought we could

1926
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:53,079
move to some more General open questions

1927
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,600
about

1928
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:58,840
you know your Reflections on your time

1929
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:00,440
uh in the industry and and and whatnot

1930
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,880
and then maybe if we have time after

1931
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:06,118
that we can come back to some of the um

1932
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:08,560
other extract questions yeah so I did

1933
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:13,079
want to come back to

1934
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:14,600
the you know um how has it been you know

1935
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:16,960
you you you mentioned women in the

1936
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:19,360
context of like veterans and like them

1937
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,679
needing safe spaces what's it like for

1938
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:24,118
you as a woman in the in the in the in

1939
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,118
the cannabis

1940
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:31,719
um feel free to be as honest as you want

1941
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:35,360
you know or not yeah yeah as diplomatic

1942
01:27:31,719 --> 01:27:38,520
or as not as you to be well it's

1943
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:42,319
definitely a man a male dominated

1944
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:46,560
industry um yeah that's for damn sure

1945
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:48,238
and for me I think my version of being a

1946
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,840
woman in the industry is probably a

1947
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:51,839
little different than some others

1948
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:54,159
because I don't have any big names

1949
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:57,800
behind behind me I don't I'm not related

1950
01:27:54,158 --> 01:28:00,479
to anybody famous um yeah I've had to

1951
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,760
fight tooth and nail to be where I am I

1952
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:06,118
remember going to get a job trying to

1953
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:07,679
get a job at the local grow store and

1954
01:28:06,118 --> 01:28:08,880
they told me they wouldn't hire me

1955
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:11,840
because I was a

1956
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:15,000
girl and I guarantee I could grow better

1957
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:18,880
weed than anybody there I promise you

1958
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:22,118
could God knocked the teeth so and for

1959
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:26,920
example when I first started this job um

1960
01:28:22,118 --> 01:28:29,960
um there was another guy that uh he he

1961
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:34,158
had actually wanted to do a article on

1962
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:39,118
me uh for some about flower rosin that

1963
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:42,479
he had gotten from me um and

1964
01:28:39,118 --> 01:28:44,238
uh anyway he he got to talking with the

1965
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:47,158
people who I'm involved with pure

1966
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:50,759
organic medicinals and he actually

1967
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:53,238
during a period of time um I had cuz I'm

1968
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:55,719
a two-time cancer Survivor I've had

1969
01:28:53,238 --> 01:28:58,039
breast cancer and ovarian cancer so a

1970
01:28:55,719 --> 01:29:00,039
couple years ago I had a scare where I

1971
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:03,920
thought my breast cancer had come back

1972
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:05,760
and so I wasn't able to come up to work

1973
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,840
uh for like 2 weeks because I had to go

1974
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,400
to my appointments and have a mammogram

1975
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:13,800
and ultrasound and all this stuff and

1976
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:16,000
during that time period this guy tried

1977
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:21,079
to take my

1978
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:25,880
job wow and I guarantee if I had been a

1979
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:27,800
male he to try to do that no yeah and uh

1980
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:31,440
cuz he was trying to set his girlfriend

1981
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:35,480
up to be the female presser for our

1982
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:38,118
company and you know and I'm like

1983
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:41,559
um I am a

1984
01:29:38,118 --> 01:29:44,719
female I don't I don't I don't need help

1985
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:47,239
like um so it it's been hard you know I

1986
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:50,719
went and took uh they paid for me to

1987
01:29:47,238 --> 01:29:52,879
take a class a hash class this the

1988
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:55,639
puranic paper for me to go take this

1989
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:59,520
hash class just to see what was going on

1990
01:29:55,639 --> 01:30:01,760
out there and uh I found it funny cuz we

1991
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,360
went to the class and when I first

1992
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,400
showed up they're like oh are you here

1993
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:10,158
to drop somebody

1994
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:14,759
off um no I'm here to take the class oh

1995
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:17,000
okay and then um I I was nice I brought

1996
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,480
you know cuz I I'm a giving person so I

1997
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,760
brought some edibles with me and I

1998
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:23,399
handed them out and I find it funny that

1999
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:26,239
after I paid for a class and took the

2000
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:28,638
class and I watched that those people in

2001
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:31,118
that class follow everybody who took the

2002
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:34,520
class but not one of them followed me

2003
01:30:31,118 --> 01:30:37,399
that's wild that is so wild to me they

2004
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:39,920
are so St it's sad oh man yeah it's sad

2005
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:42,920
but also like unsurprising um

2006
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:45,319
unfortunately to me it's also their loss

2007
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:48,079
like even in our group you know like our

2008
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:50,399
group it is a very good demographic of

2009
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:54,760
mostly male like the Cannabis Community

2010
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:57,679
is it's like a few females and 99% male

2011
01:30:54,760 --> 01:31:01,360
but like not at any time would I have

2012
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:04,239
ever thought to not like respect

2013
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:05,839
your experience and skills because

2014
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:08,079
you're a woman like it wouldn't have

2015
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,800
mattered if your name was Sweet Peach

2016
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:12,840
kiss or douge Bob fresh you know like it

2017
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,320
wouldn't have mattered and I just it

2018
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:16,039
blows my mind that people are so

2019
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:17,759
ignorant they'll walk away from some

2020
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:22,158
someone super talented that they could

2021
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:25,520
learn a lot from just to uh not have to

2022
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:27,279
cater to women or some annoying [ __ ] I I

2023
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,679
don't get it myself

2024
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:32,279
but it is that I just want to say you

2025
01:31:30,679 --> 01:31:34,679
know shout out and respect to all the

2026
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:37,439
women in the industry it can't be easy

2027
01:31:34,679 --> 01:31:40,359
um DN right for all those

2028
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:41,839
reasons um and yeah I think you know

2029
01:31:40,359 --> 01:31:43,679
we're going to we we do what we can I

2030
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,360
think within our little Community to to

2031
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,920
make sure that you know people feel as

2032
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:51,839
as safe and as comfortable and as

2033
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:54,158
welcome as we can make them um but yeah

2034
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,679
it's definitely a set of problems that

2035
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:59,799
like this industry is not dealt with yet

2036
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:01,480
not very well not at all not at all yeah

2037
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,840
not to mention I could tell you a couple

2038
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:06,000
of hash makers who I've had to block cuz

2039
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:08,560
they you know for some reason find it

2040
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,279
necessary to find send pictures and not

2041
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:13,480
hash oh yeah and that's another thing in

2042
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:14,840
our like I hear this all the time guys

2043
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:17,198
keep your dick in your pants women don't

2044
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:19,480
want to see that it's ugly like no I've

2045
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:21,479
never heard heard of a woman in my life

2046
01:32:19,479 --> 01:32:23,079
being like man I'd really like to see

2047
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:26,079
some someone's penis that's a very

2048
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:29,039
attractive fleshy member like what do

2049
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:30,559
they think like this is not how it works

2050
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:33,118
it's not how much rather see a picture

2051
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,239
of hash yeah right show me your hash

2052
01:32:33,118 --> 01:32:37,000

2053
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:39,519
not your little dick right yeah cuz now

2054
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,560
I got to block you and [ __ ] all that

2055
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,719
cuz it's totally inappropriate and

2056
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:46,080
unnecessary and like really and it

2057
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:47,399
creates a lot of bad feelings too

2058
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:49,920
because it's not just you it's your man

2059
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:52,599
too because now you know what I mean no

2060

those things where like they're

2077
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:35,719
such the obstacles that you face must be

2078
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:38,039
so subtle sometimes and so Sinister and

2079

01:33:47,479 --> 01:33:52,799
anything else we just um draw people's

2085
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:57,960
attention to the fact that these things

2086
01:33:52,800 --> 01:34:00,960
happen um yeah still y you know I just

2087
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,480
to add to this I watched you know I I

2088
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,679
had had mentioned that we were going to

2089
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:06,439
be putting Miss Jill seeds on the site

2090
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:09,600
and and I was pretty disgusted at the

2091
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:11,879
response that that the male people were

2092
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,600
giving her a lot of it had nothing to do

2093
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:16,279
with her as like being a person it was

2094
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,000
more about her being female and I just

2095
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:20,679
judging her off just being female and it

2096
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,238
was just so bad and I ended up blocking

2097
01:34:20,679 --> 01:34:26,600
so many people that day it's just yeah

2098
01:34:23,238 --> 01:34:28,759
do better please do better can ofis

2099
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:33,880
Community you know that's part of why I

2100

don't post pictures like uh of myself

2101

smoking and doing all that cuz I I want

2102
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:41,519
to be taken seriously I don't want to be

2103
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:43,759
seen as an influencer or a dab ho I've

2104
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:47,080
had to work really hard to not be

2105
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,840
considered as a dab ho you know um oh

2106
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:51,000
God you have to work extra hard you have

2107
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,000
to work extra hard and that's that's not

2108
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,840
fair

2109
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,118
mind yeah yeah it's actually so terrible

2110
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:58,440
like yeah what do you have to wear like

2111
01:34:56,118 --> 01:35:01,079
fake glasses to look smarter and I don't

2112
01:34:58,439 --> 01:35:02,879
know like keep your hair shorter man

2113
01:35:01,079 --> 01:35:05,079
it's actually so

2114
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,319
ridiculous no I actually you know I

2115
01:35:05,079 --> 01:35:10,279
posted a picture of myself washing hash

2116
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:14,319
and I I'm sorry I have boobs I'm a

2117
01:35:10,279 --> 01:35:16,198
female and sometimes in the cold room

2118
01:35:14,319 --> 01:35:18,079
even in the middle of the summer it's

2119
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:20,799
cold but when you're washing hash you'll

2120
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:23,639
get warm like I do I don't know maybe

2121
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:26,079
it's just hot flash or whatever anyway

2122
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:28,199
so I posted a video of me watching hash

2123
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:30,920
because I'm proud of the fact that I can

2124
01:35:28,198 --> 01:35:33,638
do this by myself like I don't have a

2125

feels yeah I mean that's that's the

2170
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:32,039
other funny part like I think people see

2171
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,960
a you know identify someone as a woman

2172

people in our in our community but

overall I think it's like a pretty good

2179
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:52,079
place and sometimes they hide in plain

2180
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:54,519
sight

2181
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:55,840

01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:19,440
the server I believe that's a

2190
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:21,880
term um I did want to move on to you

2191
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:25,079
kind of reflecting more on GI Janes as

2192
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:26,440
well um as kind of adjacent um so you

2193
01:38:25,079 --> 01:38:29,158

2194
01:38:26,439 --> 01:38:30,638
over Co um is it starting back up is it

2195
01:38:29,158 --> 01:38:33,279

2199
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:45,439
somewhere for us all to meet and um I

2200

live up in the hills and I well plus I

2201
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:49,559
don't let strangers come to my house I

2202
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:51,279
mean I do know these ladies but like if

2203

2204
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:57,118

people at my house um yeah so we're I

2206
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:01,039
I'm I'm still currently looking for a

2207
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:02,599
meeting place cuz it needs to be

2208
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,960
somewhere where we can hang out and

2209
01:39:02,599 --> 01:39:10,760
smoke yes you know um not many people

2210
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:12,279
allow that yeah I was just thinking

2211
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:15,560
sorry this is totally an interruption

2212
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:18,319
but I was just thinking um I don't know

2213
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:19,560
how the women are with tick but you know

2214
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,039
you could always set up like a little

2215
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:25,080
Discord just for them as well um in the

2216
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:27,238
absence of like a you know a physical

2217
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:29,920
space um you could have a little Discord

2218
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:32,479

2219

um yeah because I don't know I I always

2225
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:51,599
think about part of it is the

2226
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:55,679
camaraderie that they have to be able to

2227
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:57,000
talk and hang out and um wow that's a

2228
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:59,960
you just

2229
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,880

01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:07,719

01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:58,920
last to I can't imagine yeah if I had

2292
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,960
seen it coming I at least could have

2293
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:04,480
fought back but I I had no clue and it

2294
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:07,319
was so quick I just remember this

2295
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:09,598
blinding pain in my head that just came

2296

2356

for like like the business and yeah what

2357
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:58,719
are you excited about well I'm excited

2358
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:01,639
about hitting

2359
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:04,279
distribution um uh and things actually

2360
01:46:01,639 --> 01:46:07,440
hitting the market uh that's probably

2361
01:46:04,279 --> 01:46:09,439
com is it is near that's what I've been

2362
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:12,479
doing this last few days is getting

2363
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:14,079
everything grammed up and packaged um it

2364
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:15,638
just takes a while because it's only me

2365
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,719
I'm the only one that does all the

2366
01:46:15,639 --> 01:46:19,400
gramming uh because I'm the only one

2367
01:46:17,719 --> 01:46:21,079
with the quality

2368
01:46:19,399 --> 01:46:23,638
control

2369
01:46:21,079 --> 01:46:26,079
um yeah makes sense so it it takes a

2370
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:30,319
while to and plus I can't be up here you

2371
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:33,399
know I have my other businesses I run um

2372
01:46:30,319 --> 01:46:34,920
and so it's it's hard I I come up here

2373
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:37,359
and I do some work but then I got to go

2374
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,079
home and do work and so I can't be up

2375
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:41,880
here plus I can't afford a hotel for

2376
01:46:39,079 --> 01:46:43,118
more than a couple days at a time I bet

2377
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:45,760
because you're investing your own money

2378
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:48,238
in this to do this correct like the gas

2379
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:51,159
Hotel well yeah between gas and hotel

2380
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:53,238
and all that yeah sometimes they pay me

2381
01:46:51,158 --> 01:46:56,598
like when they have money and then like

2382
01:46:53,238 --> 01:46:59,039
I said sometimes they don't so it's you

2383
01:46:56,599 --> 01:47:02,239
know it's a labor of love for you and

2384
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:04,960
and hoping it yes it is yeah so getting

2385
01:47:02,238 --> 01:47:07,479
to hit distribution means I will be

2386
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:09,319
getting a paycheck eventually like

2387
01:47:07,479 --> 01:47:12,000
that's what I'm hoping for so this

2388
01:47:09,319 --> 01:47:14,519
becomes my full-time job so I can fully

2389
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,960
immerse in it and then if it all takes

2390
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,599
off then they're supposed to put in a

2391
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:20,800
kitchen so that then my Edibles can hit

2392
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:24,199
the market and that's probably another

2393
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:26,480
thing that I'm most excited about money

2394
01:47:24,198 --> 01:47:29,000
money when people taste your Edibles

2395
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:31,959
that's money I'm telling you I've tried

2396
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:34,760
so many Edibles it's

2397
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:37,039
money you have to let me and Matt know

2398
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:38,280
when things are starting up so we can

2399
01:47:37,039 --> 01:47:41,519
like

2400

extract Channel um I know we sort of

2443
