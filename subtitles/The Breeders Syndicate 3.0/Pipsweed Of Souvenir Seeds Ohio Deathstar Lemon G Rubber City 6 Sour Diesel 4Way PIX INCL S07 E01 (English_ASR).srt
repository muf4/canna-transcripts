you're currently doing with your your

29
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,400
career

30
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,500
um so let's start at the beginning let's

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,118
start talking about one of the

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,859
one of the Clones they held your

33
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,478
interest the most uh when you first

34
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,280
started growing what was circulating at

35
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,259
the time

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,540
um I mean when I first started growing

37
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,519
it was just I I had gotten random clones

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,140
from a few different people uh they

39
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,199
weren't really anything special it was

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,759
something orange really low yielding uh

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,500
that's what I ran for my first several

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,700
grows and it was kind of depressing but

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,140
it was better than nothing because it

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,380
had a good smell and it was you know

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,319
decent smoke at least for me at the time

46
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:06,060
but uh the main ones uh you know I would

47
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,340
say probably with when the lemon G and

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,899
the Death Star came into my light was

49
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,060
like really when I saw like the full

50
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,739
potential of like good quality cannabis

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,378
and

52
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,360
um and it's it really fascinated me so

53
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:19,560
that kind of like gave me the oomph to

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,340
take it to the next level and take

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,560
things seriously and uh and I did and I

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,020
you know grew those for a long time for

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,239
over a decade straight and uh made a lot

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,340
off of them how early into your like

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,780
smoking like from the age of where you

60
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,539
started smoking to where you started

61
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,039
growing like how long did it take until

62
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,318
you started getting like death star

63
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,679
quality type weed okay so when I first

64
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,479
started smoking I was probably around 13

65
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,640
and uh I was just get I got weed from

66
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,619
this kid at school and he stole it from

67
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,419
his dad and sold it to me for you know

68
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,700
twenty dollars I paid him in rolls of

69
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,699
quarters I stole from my my parents

70
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,679
closet or something like that you know

71
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,959
um and smoked it and I didn't get high

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,900
yeah so the first time I really ever

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,819
smoked weed I never really got a buzz

74
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,659
and then um

75
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:11,098
later on you know I would you know High

76
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,259
School came around you know we had

77
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:16,259
access to the swag basically the seated

78
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,939
pressed Mexican stuff right yeah um

79
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,979
there's different varying levels of that

80
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,780
uh some were actually surprisingly good

81
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,959
except it wasn't really compressed and

82
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,000
had the nice mature seeds in it uh a lot

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,519
of lime green stuff like that too we

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,098
call it the Christmas trees but uh there

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,140
was good stuff as well but um

86
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,818
I don't know I would say probably my

87
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,859
sophomore year of high school was when I

88
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,439
discovered what we called at the time

89
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,659
kind bud KB

90
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,060
um and it was in Akron at a college

91
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,378
party and one of my smoking buddies and

92
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,199
good friends I've known for a long time

93
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,459
came downstairs and showed me this I was

94
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,339
out on the porch and he showed me this

95
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,598
Bud he's like look at this KB bro and

96
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,739
I'm like what the hell is KB like

97
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,679
I'm looking at it I'm like what the hell

98
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,299
is this he's like it's weed and I I

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,159
looked at it and smelled it I was like

100
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,080
you gotta be kidding me dude

101
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,239
oh that's confusing going from

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,819
compressed to seeing like your first

103
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,340
actual dance Bud like well-grown

104
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:17,159
manicured [ __ ] personally Bud yeah

105
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,959
yeah so at that point I had already been

106
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,340
uh selling stuff for a while I did

107
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,139
through high school and stuff just to

108
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,698
make extra money we you know I didn't

109
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,060
come from the wealthiest family in the

110
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:29,460
world by any means so uh it's kind of in

111
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,620
a you know growing up situation was kind

112
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,359
of every kid fend for himself after a

113
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,579
certain point so

114
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,660
I did what I had to do to survive and

115
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,359
make money

116
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,100
so that's how uh that's what I did for a

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,740
while and then eventually you know after

118
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,040
I mean senior year I grew some plants I

119
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,800
grew my first plants yeah uh outside my

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,419
parents backyard way in the back and I

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,759
planted them late and they weren't going

122
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:55,740
to finish in time and I knew it so I dug

123
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,479
them out of the ground and put them in

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,220
pots and brought them inside and put

125
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:00,779
them in my closet to finish out like the

126
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,120
last you know three weeks or whatever

127
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:06,359
they needed yeah I line the whole closet

128
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
with tinfoil black light black lights in

129
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,160
there like you know what I mean yeah

130
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,459
yeah totally it was it was looking back

131
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,840
it's just hilarious but um I was worried

132
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,060
I was going to get caught my mom wasn't

133
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,418
super mean but she would uh she would

134
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,120
whip my ass probably I thought yeah

135
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:26,399
and uh I had harvested it eventually and

136
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,740
then like months later maybe a year

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,899
later she told me that uh while I was at

138
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,000
school she was watering it because it

139
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,579
was about to die that whole time but she

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,199
never told me and my mom was a gardener

141
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,639
too I grew up growing flowers all kinds

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,340
of flowers and planting gardens at our

143
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,500
house and other people's houses so

144
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,538
that's kind of like you know we're I got

145
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,279
a little bit of a green thumb before the

146
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,800
whole cannabis thing so I understood how

147
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,138
things work and yeah and you know how to

148
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,000
water and how to feed and you know what

149
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,800
a healthy plant looks like and what a

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,819
sick plant looks like and all that kind

151
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,819
of stuff how to prune them

152
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,979
um and then I never heard that story

153
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,120
about your mom that's funny

154
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:09,060
she's a sweet lady she's been put

155
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,160
through hell over her lifetime but mad I

156
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,139
can't even picture my grandma being like

157
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,699
Oh I'll just take care of the thing like

158
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,379
you know what I mean that's pretty cool

159
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:21,000
that's pretty rad

160
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:23,219
yeah so um I would say uh what was it

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,139
probably right after right after high

162
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,300
school is really when I started you know

163
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,819
growing pretty good and I you know

164
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,038
probably three four years after that I

165
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,560
uh I'd say

166
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,759
2005 six seven ish right around those

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,339
years I started getting a lot of really

168
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,900
good genetics I moved up to Akron

169
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:44,279
and uh I met a friend of mine who is

170
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:45,719
still a really good friend of mine we

171
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,258
know each other for a really long time

172
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,960
he's a good guy his name's Jay and he

173
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:55,759
shared a lot of really nice clothes with

174
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:58,560
me he shared the um the Bubba Kush

175
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,160
he shared the lemon tree The Afghani

176
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,259
mango the Death Star the sour diesel

177
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,460
those were like the main ones you know

178
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,259
we've had different things over the

179
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,939
years and stuff this is very early at

180
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,919
that time to be getting clones like that

181
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,259
too for people listening that aren't

182
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,359
aware this is actually pretty early to

183
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,180
be uh having access to stuff like that

184
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,979
in in random circles so it's pretty cool

185
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,959
that's a good connect

186
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:23,639
I had the Indiana bubble gum research

187
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,500
was around at that time

188
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,139
um one of the very first ones I ever got

189
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,519
is one that 99.9 of the you know percent

190
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,560
of the people listening aren't gonna

191
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,839
know what it is unless you're local but

192
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,780
it was called um wanaki some people say

193
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,418
hunaki and it was pretty frequent early

194
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,159
2000s around this area being sold

195
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,500
and a lot of people around here remember

196
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,979
it uh so that's one I've had in my

197
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,779
collection you know since probably 2000

198
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:51,659
and what's happening like

199
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:54,000
it's a it's kind of like Jack oh really

200
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,740
yeah um I've done a lot of research it

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
might I don't know what it is I feel

202
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,379
like it could be like J1 maybe or I

203
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,180
don't know it came from it was a big uh

204
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,719
a lot of the big Asian crews around this

205
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,418
area uh ran that it was a it was a big

206
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,740
one uh and it was everywhere but this

207
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,719
was back in the day it was for a short

208
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,860
period of like two or three years that I

209
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,419
remember our group getting it

210
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,160
consistently

211
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,740
yeah yeah that was one of the first ones

212
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,780
I got was that a TV

213
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,340
yeah it was it was pretty yeah it's like

214
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,799
it's it's tea lean but it's got like

215
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,839
that funkiness that fun yeah kind of

216
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,879
like thing in it well that's interesting

217
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,218
yeah that's cool it's a beautiful it's a

218
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,778
beautiful plant uh I I don't it's those

219
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,520
kind of plants aren't my favorite to

220
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:38,399
smoke I don't like the turquently and

221
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,079
stuff yeah uh but I keep it because I've

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,179
had it for so long and I do enjoy the

223
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,158
Aromas uh that come from those plants

224
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,659
and I do I mean I enjoy the looking at

225
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,700
them and growing them and seeing the

226
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,620
different colors and you know yeah

227
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,420
so I keep it around I throw it in the

228
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,039
flower room once every couple years and

229
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:55,019
do a nice one of it

230
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,039
hand it out to friends or something you

231
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,778
know

232
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,059
but if you're a sativa person you know

233
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:01,860
you like that kind of stuff that's uh

234
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,958
you know it's a good plant it's just

235
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,100
super nostalgic yeah it's great if

236
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,859
you're from around here and you're

237
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,959
around in those times

238
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,720
so we have that we have the one would

239
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,759
you wanaki

240
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,519
we called it the knock the knock okay

241
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,838
that's easier the wanaki the the we we

242
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,000
didn't want to mess around with the

243
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,459
pronunciation so we just we just called

244
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,539
it The Knack

245
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,979
that wasn't like that was just our

246
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,439
friend group that wasn't like everybody

247
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,600
you know that was just us we referred to

248
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,519
it as the knock so that's one of the

249
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,620
really interesting things about weed

250
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,899
that I like a bunch is that how like

251
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,940
especially it seems much more so in

252
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:42,059
America than other places

253
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,500
every crew is insistent on giving all

254
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,958
these different strains they get little

255
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,759
nicknames and then amongst that little

256
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,518
crew it becomes like just what it's

257
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,379
known by you know and so these different

258
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,879
strains at different times can take on

259
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:56,700
different lives

260
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,838
and you only know what your friend gives

261
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,720
it to you as

262
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,100
well

263
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,540
you know it could start off as that and

264
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,600
then it turns into the knock and then it

265
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:08,159
turns into this and then you know and uh

266
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,778
it's it's interesting because sometimes

267
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,519
you don't make those connections unless

268
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:13,379
you know someone that knew it by both

269
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,039
names right

270
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,419
yeah you know it can happen you know

271
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,519
um I mean we definitely have seen

272
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,958
strains that like we think it's one

273
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,700
thing and we'll probably talk about that

274
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,139
a little later but we we think it's one

275
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,399
thing and then lo and behold it turns

276
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,639
out to be another

277
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,500
you know we think it's another and you

278
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,480
know I'm I'm originally from the Midwest

279
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,278
too although I've been in California a

280
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,080
long time now

281
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,600
um and it's kind of interesting how the

282
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,259
Midwest works in the sense that it was

283
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,079
much less like trendy it was basically

284
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,720
like as as pip was saying it's like if

285
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,039
you got something better than Mexican it

286
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,379
was better than Mexican

287
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,539
and it wasn't there wasn't competition

288
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,600
for it the the desire for something

289
00:10:54,539 --> 00:11:00,480
better than Mexican was huge so any kind

290
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,519
of kind bud you had went any kind of

291
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
right we called it dank you know we used

292
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,600
to call it nuggets and the reason why we

293
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
called it nuggets is because only

294
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,740
nuggets were uncompressed

295
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,439
you know like you had the shape of the

296
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,240
bud the Nugget itself you know and so it

297
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
looked like nuggets where it's like most

298
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,720
other stuff was compressed and even if

299
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,419
it was lightly compressed it still

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,920
changed it but if I can stop yeah so you

301
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,240
know it we had some nice stuff every

302
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,740
once in a while you run around nice

303
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,500
stuff but a lot of the Homegrown stuff

304
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,159
back then was a little bit creamy a

305
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,320
little bit moist still you know

306
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,319
um and then we have my town anything

307
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,360
better than Mexican was kind bud right

308
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,399
right same here like if it was messed up

309
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,200
if it wasn't dried the right way or

310
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,600
cured the right way if it was preemie

311
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,100
there wasn't competition for it there

312
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,659
was still more people that wanted it

313
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,339
than there was it

314
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:53,519
so it just went

315
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,680
beasters I mean beasters was kind bud

316
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,240
this was kind bud some of you guys

317
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,879
remember that that stuff went for the

318
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,320
same ticket it went for 50 and eight you

319
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,879
know some people probably charging more

320
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,579
I mean if you had if you knew a guy who

321
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,078
knew a guy you'd get the 40 deal but you

322
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:09,120
know straight up it was 50 bucks an

323
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,759
eighth when it first hit the funny thing

324
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,459
about about beasters in Canada is like

325
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,259
the really bad beasters they sent to the

326
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,578
parts of America that they thought had

327
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,439
no competition

328
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:20,458
and then the parts of America they

329
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,560
thought had a little bit more

330
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,419
competition from outdoor or indoor they

331
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,338
would send like a different grade

332
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:28,679
so depending on what part of the country

333
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,720
you're in sometimes there was some stuff

334
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,120
that was actually pretty damn good

335
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
for the time and then there was some

336
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,139
stuff that you were like oh

337
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:41,099
now I will say our Canadian Watchers

338
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:43,139
have wanted me to to say remember they

339
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,100
only sent their crap down here right

340
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,100
yeah

341
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,480
they're like just remember we had good

342
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:52,980
[ __ ] we just didn't share with y'all we

343
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,019
could chat about we could chat about

344
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,759
that later too but pip and I have had

345
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,060
some long combos about there's certain

346
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:01,679
strains he has that he even likes them

347
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,899
sort of fermented

348
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,000
oh and you know and what I mean by that

349
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,679
is that a lot of times beasters because

350
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,720
I mean think of it it's like it wasn't

351
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,879
cured that great it was still had some

352
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,339
moisture in it and then they'd seal it

353
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,679
in a freezer in a freeze and freezer you

354
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,720
know sealer meals and ship it and it

355
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,000
would get no air exchange for a couple

356
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,519
of weeks until somebody cracked it and

357
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,320
some of that beasters would firm it and

358
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,480
I remember having conversations with Pip

359
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,040
about that and he was like man you know

360
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,019
there's a couple strains that I actually

361
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:34,199
do that intentionally to

362
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,539
because I like the fermentation process

363
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,180
which is almost like that African cob

364
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,759
work yeah in a way right yeah the

365
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,979
fermentation stuff uh you know it seems

366
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,259
to me like a lot of the gassier stuff

367
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,539
that I run it does it really well like

368
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,879
the Death Star uh you know you cure that

369
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,439
at super high humidity uh I had my notes

370
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,179
somewhere I forget it's like I put it

371
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,300
keep it in like a five gallon bucket

372
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:59,699
with a screw top lid for 75 humidity or

373
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,859
something like that for a while and and

374
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,778
not a cold area though you want that

375
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,519
warm air to kind of like get that

376
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,838
process going I feel like it takes a

377
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,419
little bit longer if you keep it in a

378
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,339
cold area but it does good with a lot of

379
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:14,278
the gassy stuff the death star dust RS

380
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,380
ones I did it with it was really good

381
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,259
um I think star dog I think I've done it

382
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,939
with before lemon G it is I love the

383
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,860
lemon G when it's done like that when

384
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,260
it's like slightly fermented like that

385
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,519
it's uh I like it fresh too I like it

386
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,259
both ways it's just you know what's your

387
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,000
preference it's different you know just

388
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:34,620
slightly different but yeah

389
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,059
just so people know too like when we

390
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,639
talk about fermentation if they're

391
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,859
unfamiliar with it a lot of times curing

392
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,139
happens on the stem and if you trim

393
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,959
stuff up kind of quick and it still has

394
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,299
some moisture content going on and you

395
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,159
start to some people call it burping you

396
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:53,219
know all that that's basically like

397
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,439
light fermentation if you're if you've

398
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,480
got fully trimmed work in a bag or in a

399
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,639
in a five gallon bucket like he's

400
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,560
talking about and it's not ready to

401
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,919
smoke yet you're kind of fermenting it

402
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,239
in a way in my opinion at least yeah and

403
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,559
you definitely got to burp it too you

404
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,139
can't just throw a bunch of wet weed in

405
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,059
a bucket and no it's called molding yeah

406
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,620
yeah yeah you don't want to do that

407
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,179
there's a fine line there's a fine line

408
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,519
it takes you a while to figure it out

409
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,620
for each strain and like all that but in

410
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,019
the time frame and all that but you know

411
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,820
I just keep it in room temp and and it's

412
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,639
done pretty good versus like in a colder

413
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,740
area stuff like that

414
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,680
yeah that's a that's a complex process

415
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,659
and I'd imagine a lot of failure uh on

416
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,120
the way to figuring it out well honestly

417
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,519
it was it was by accident really you

418
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,860
know in my earlier years yeah I just you

419
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,899
know left some stuff it just it did the

420
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,120
process by itself I guess I just left it

421
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,799
in a bag or I left it somewhere and I

422
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,120
would notice every time I did that that

423
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,698
stuff that was a little bit more moist

424
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,919
and sat upstairs in a bag after a couple

425
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,719
months or whatever it taste it was like

426
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,599
it was a little bit darker like it was

427
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,399
like like degrading you know but and it

428
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,259
wasn't as loud but it wasn't like with

429
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,419
the Death Star it was like sweet it like

430
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,740
loses its gas a little bit and becomes

431
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:06,659
like sweet

432
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,940
and uh

433
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,679
and it's just I mean it's super smooth

434
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,839
smoke it's way smoother than like

435
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,458
smoking a fresh Bud out off of a plant

436
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,699
or something I remember the smoke was

437
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:20,099
super rich it was Thick Smoke

438
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:22,439
yeah I mean fermented stuff super thick

439
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,720
cloudy smoke oh nice thing I sent you

440
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,300
left about it oh okay I didn't know I

441
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,740
got the flower yeah it's uh dude it's

442
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,698
it's awesome I enjoy it it's not

443
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,500
something I'm going to smoke all the

444
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,479
time but like you know it's like a fine

445
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,940
wine it's just it's cool smoking and

446
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,259
getting that sweet flavor and like I

447
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,600
don't know it's just you gotta you gotta

448
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,220
try it to understand it and that that's

449
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,899
also something that's interesting I

450
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,639
think too about like the era we're

451
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,399
talking about where information didn't

452
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,259
exchange as fast and a lot of times like

453
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,958
when I learned like how I cure and stuff

454
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,240
it was kind of like you dry things and

455
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,159
sometimes it goes well and sometimes it

456
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,339
doesn't and then sometimes you learn

457
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:01,139
things good and bad by accident on right

458
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,579
how you treated it you know and that's

459
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,199
kind of what it sounds like you know all

460
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,279
you you put it up there you put it in a

461
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,199
bag and all of a sudden it did this

462
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,459
thing you weren't expecting and then

463
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,199
you're like oh well how did I do that

464
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,480
and you start playing with like what you

465
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,160
did to make it do that right you know oh

466
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,660
does it work with this other strain nope

467
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,939
this strain doesn't like it at all but

468
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,160
this strain boy do I like what it does

469
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,140
when it does that and I think that's

470
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,819
kind of cool because you know a lot of

471
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,699
times one of the cool things about

472
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:30,298
growing in the midwest is that because

473
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,700
change was slower back home people grew

474
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:34,918
the same strains for longer

475
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,419
there was there was less turnover where

476
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,919
like all of a sudden your customers are

477
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,820
like oh this is bunk I need something

478
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,000
new

479
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:44,579
yeah that doesn't happen

480
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,460
yeah they were just stoked you get

481
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:49,379
what's there that's that's what it is

482
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,900
and so as a result of that sometimes

483
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,240
Midwestern Growers really got to dial in

484
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,640
certain strains because they had a long

485
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,339
relationship of success by being able to

486
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,259
grow them right um and it's also we'll

487
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,759
talk about that soon

488
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:04,558
um some of the some of the stuff that

489
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,500
you know that uh pip has in his

490
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:10,139
collection is pretty rare Nationwide

491
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,579
because there wasn't pressure to move on

492
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,500
to a new thing

493
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:15,720
you know there was various clones and

494
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,640
cuts getting passed around locally and

495
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,700
they did well locally so they had their

496
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,559
own they had a life of their own almost

497
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,600
um we're in California you know populate

498
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,859
you know popularity changes and all of a

499
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,379
sudden everyone dumped something and

500
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,000
just moves on to the next new thing

501
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,640
right

502
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,259
you're exactly right you were able to I

503
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,200
mean you were you were telling us

504
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:39,240
you know death star and lemon G like

505
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,038
we're the better part of a seven eight

506
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,000
year run for you in terms of success

507
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:47,940
right I mean yeah man I mean I've I ran

508
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,740
them hard hard for you know at least

509
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,419
eight years you know and then I kind of

510
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,058
brought new other strains in and I was

511
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,759
still running lemon G and death star so

512
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:58,379
so over that over that time you know you

513
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,960
know especially with indoor where you

514
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,480
get to do a number of rips a year you

515
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,058
really get to learn how the plant likes

516
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,000
to grow how big to get it what size pots

517
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:10,558
how to feed all that type of stuff you

518
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,359
know really like you really get it's

519
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,980
like a long-term relationship you really

520
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,979
get to know your partner

521
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,860
you're right you're so right man it's uh

522
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,200
you know it took me uh I'd say it

523
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:24,479
probably to fully Master Lemon G

524
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,360
consistently uh especially on a bigger

525
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,819
scale you know took me probably a solid

526
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,019
four or five years uh you know and that

527
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,359
was at the beginning when I started

528
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,980
growing too so nowadays it probably it's

529
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,558
not as difficult but

530
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,558
uh it's a finicky plan it's not

531
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:43,319
something that you can throw in with a

532
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,019
bunch of other plants and expect it to

533
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,000
you know do well you got to kind of like

534
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:50,460
give it its own environment its own

535
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,900
everything like lemon G doesn't like a

536
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,340
lot of light it doesn't like a lot of

537
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,280
heat like cannabis plants in general

538
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,918
don't but lemon G especially

539
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:02,339
um I raise my lights up to do crops and

540
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:05,038
it flourishes under you know 25 watts

541
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,720
per square foot like really really low

542
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,279
lighting

543
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,200
um that's half of what suggested I

544
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:14,220
believe they suggest what 50 60 watts

545
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,779
per square foot yeah so and that's what

546
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,038
I've been running for most of my life

547
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,038
honestly

548
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,919
um it's it's I I like that I get good

549
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,179
quality off of it and it keeps the heat

550
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,799
down because I don't have to have a

551
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,700
bunch of Lights packed in somewhere you

552
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:30,538
know

553
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,880
but I also think it keeps the Terps

554
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:34,859
um a lot of times one you know you you

555
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,419
do two hotter lights on the top foot

556
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,519
foot and a half of your plant might look

557
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,559
gorgeous but it might have some of the

558
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,019
Terps burned out by the intensity and

559
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,178
like actually the bottoms tend to smell

560
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:47,940
and taste better so you can get away

561
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:50,160
with less light more of the plant brings

562
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,080
out some of that subtlety I guess

563
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,759
and in my area we've always I should

564
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,980
mention we've always had low ceilings

565
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,558
the houses at low basement ceilings in

566
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,919
the houses around so uh you've actually

567
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,379
seen before so uh I was kind of a lot of

568
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,299
people around here use 600 Waters and

569
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,520
that's what I've used pretty much since

570
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:11,160
I started I've used thousands before but

571
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:15,359
ninety percent of what I've done is all

572
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,279
been 600 watt lights so

573
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,079
yeah well Amsterdam had the same thing

574
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,000
when I first started going there they

575
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,619
were all four and six hundreds they

576
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,259
thought a thousand Watts were crazy

577
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:27,359
American stuff yeah

578
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,460
so now that we're on to Lemon G let's

579
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,079
talk a little bit one about the genetics

580
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,058
of lemon G

581
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:34,740
um the history of lemon G and the

582
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,839
terpene profile limited because that's

583
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,339
really like I think I mean what most

584
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,980
people find really exceptional about

585
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,119
lemon juice that flavor smell all that

586
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,659
goodness

587
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:47,519
um my first introduction to it was uh on

588
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,679
the forums you know there was there was

589
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,500
some speculation about it being skunk

590
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,380
Misty something you know there's some

591
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,380
speculation G13 hash plant you know

592
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,179
expression what have you found out

593
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,559
well there yeah there's you know I've

594
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,440
been told a lot of things over the years

595
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:06,058
I've been married to a lot of theories

596
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,980
different theories over the years a

597
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,940
couple at least yeah

598
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,159
um

599
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,220
and you know

600
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:17,400
a lot of a lot of what you read is not

601
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,058
the case uh some people are close you

602
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,820
know

603
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:23,339
um but I was able to get the story from

604
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:25,019
a friend of mine who worked for the lady

605
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:26,579
who made it I'm not going to mention her

606
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,099
name sure

607
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:33,359

611
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,240
now the June the G13 this this lady got

612
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,580
as seeds from I believe from a friend I

613
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,640
don't think she ordered them yeah uh I

614
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:55,558
don't know what they are I have no idea

615
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,600
um G13 skunk G13 hash plant G13 nl2 how

616
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:01,139
many G13 crosses was there you know yeah

617
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:04,139
yeah who knows uh but that's uh you know

618
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,259
and this is a good buddy this is uh my

619
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,240
my my really good buddy who

620
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,819
he wouldn't [ __ ] me or anything like

621
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,798
that so uh that's what she says that's

622
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,359
from her mouth that's I guess what she's

623
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,980
always said so just to kind of clear

624
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,158
that up that's where the stories add on

625
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,759
the lemon Chi as far as what it is

626
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,539
um

627
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,038
I don't know exactly what year uh it was

628
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:28,700
made I would assume it was probably

629
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,500
somewhere in like the early 2000s yeah

630
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,179
uh that's kind of like what I feel but

631
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,538
I've never really gotten an exact date

632
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,298
on it so and the terp profile how would

633
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:41,038
you best describe the flavor of G3 or

634
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:46,079
lemon G sorry

635
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:49,079
lemon juice lemon G lemon G is very very

636
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,079
lemony

637
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:55,319
um yeah not hardly I mean no no Turf in

638
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,960
a lean or anything like that really do

639
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,819
you notice any Matt no okay because I

640
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,159
can't pick it up if there is any uh

641
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:05,538
lemon

642
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,539
and uh lemon rind and lemon

643
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,179
it leans lemon astringent yes you know

644
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,038
like it doesn't have a lot of sweetness

645
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,259
on the back end it has like a very

646
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,440
pungent lemon

647
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:22,019
let me stop let me stop you sir when you

648
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,159
grow it like crap it gets that very it's

649
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:28,500
that very like Randy bitter almost smell

650
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,740
but if you if you grow that plant good

651
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,740
it comes out it's like sweet sugar candy

652
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,720
lemon G ooh I'm telling you there's it's

653
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,339
a finicky plant and most people get rid

654
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,960
of it because they can't they can't get

655
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:41,879
it to perform right they just get that

656
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,700
like basic version of it like Frank like

657
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,320
uh he was just yeah yeah so yeah just

658
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,140
get that basic version

659
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,819
and um and they have a hard time with it

660
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,220
but like I said it took me several of

661
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:56,460
your faces as we both realized oh we

662
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,519
only ever grew it like [ __ ] no but I

663
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,380
mean

664
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:03,418
I I have a thing with Citrus where like

665
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,460
you know there's there's a range there

666
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,919
from like spraying mouth like cleaner

667
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,840
into your mouth to like a little like I

668
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,380
tend to like the sweet back end because

669
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:15,298
it balances the astringent you know

670
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,620
um and it's one of those things where

671
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:22,200
for me like I love Citrus but I have to

672
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:25,139
have other things need other things I

673
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,360
can't have citrus be my only weed yeah

674
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,820
you know when I described lemon G I

675
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,939
always tell people it's like a lemon

676
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:36,000
came into a being formed like a human

677
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,900
form and then pissed lemon into your

678
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,880
mouth

679
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,038
that's about how I can describe lemon G

680
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,000
it's just so lemon I it's it's very

681
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:47,460
unique to me uh I've I've seen a lot of

682
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,778
plants and I was lucky to get that

683
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,179
planter I was so lucky to get that plant

684
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:53,700
earlier yeah I mean that I can't believe

685
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,919
it but it's so it's still to this day

686
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,259
it's so unique there's nothing that I've

687
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,538
ever seen really that smells like lemon

688
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:02,778
G like lemon G does that didn't come

689
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:05,099
from lemon juice

690
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:06,599
like when you pull lemon G out and you

691
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,480
give it to somebody that's never smelled

692
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,579
it before I don't care who you are your

693
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,400
eyes are lighting up like you're like

694
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:16,619
what is this you know

695
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,960
um it just blows you away and it's a

696
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:22,619
good Buzz uh indoor it's it's decent

697
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,600
outdoor that plant is magical I love the

698
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:26,339
buzz of that stuff outside and I will

699
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:30,000
only smoke lemon G if it's grown outside

700
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:33,480
oh wow um it's just so much better in my

701
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,038
opinion um but I I grew it indoor most

702
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,659
of my life and it's still good don't get

703
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,298
me wrong it's still good it's a it's a

704
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:41,880
light Buzz it's happy yeah it's 100

705
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:43,440
percent it's all my female customers

706
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,299
over the years require it's the number

707
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,220
one requested for some reason the ladies

708
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:49,558
absolutely love it it keeps it gives

709
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,179
them energy they clean on it you know

710
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,278
and all that stuff

711
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,500
so um

712
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,298
so yeah it's been it's been pretty you

713
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,419
know pretty popular with the females as

714
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:02,879
well have you um have you tried lemon

715
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,400
tree or lemonade yet

716
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,679
uh I haven't I've heard lemon tree

717
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,900
smells a lot like lemon G but I tend to

718
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,500
think that they're related some ways to

719
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,840
me it's it has to be a lemon tree it has

720
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,000
to be yeah in my opinion

721
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,619
yeah uh another thing I wanted to

722
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,659
mention is my buddy mentioned that he

723
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:25,798
had smoked uh my same good buddy again

724
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:28,740
he smoked um uh the G13 what was it it

725
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,000
was a G13 skunk uh back in the day and

726
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,859
he said that's the closest thing he's

727
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,380
ever spelled to Lemon G it was like very

728
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,939
spot on but it was just kind of mild so

729
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,740
I thought that was a kind of interesting

730
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,298
you know thing and then I know a lot of

731
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,778
people are going to ask about what's the

732
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:45,599
skunk Misty as well yeah and honestly

733
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:48,119
um I haven't I I wish I could tell you

734
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,558
it's probably uh they had a string

735
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,058
called Misty back in the day it didn't

736
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:52,859
they Nirvana or something Nirvana

737
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:54,720
Nirvana seeds not to be confused with

738
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,298
your people always confused Nirvana with

739
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,460
Gypsy Nirvana whenever I say oh yeah so

740
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:00,658
no Nirvana seats had a Misti and I can't

741
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,940
remember off the top of my head I can't

742
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,640
remember what it was NL something

743
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,640
and so basically everything in Amsterdam

744
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,919
then that wasn't from Neville or a few

745
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,659
other breeders almost everything was was

746
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,240
something by Skunk one

747
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,059
pretty much you know so having something

748
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,659
that was Misty by Skunk one in the 90s

749
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:23,700
that was the most common hybrid in

750
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,039
Amsterdam was something by Skunk one

751
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,380
right because skunk one was just

752
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,079
consistent you know and I actually can

753
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,059
kind of like that the G13 straight cut

754
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:36,658
that you had pip

755
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:38,460
um I can kind of see skunk and G13 in

756
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,320
that lemon G

757
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,179
yeah oh yeah

758
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,639
um I mean lemon G is kind of like it's

759
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,380
kind of got that uh this is this is like

760
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,159
people don't take this the wrong way but

761
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,440
it kind of has that like ugliness to it

762
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,240
you know there was an ERA where like we

763
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,480
didn't have to be pretty

764
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,419
you know and lemon G definitely has kind

765
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,960
of that like G13 like weird Bud

766
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:06,419
formation Leaf formation especially look

767
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,460
you know and then you know from skunk

768
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,900
one some kind of citrus coming through

769
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,200
is pretty common

770
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,080
so I can see you know it's it probably

771
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,298
the skunk one probably took the G13 from

772
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,058
being leafy in a mess and made it gave

773
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:22,918
it that nice running Cola that probably

774
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:25,319
made it such a good Cropper for you for

775
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,880
a long time right you know

776
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,119
and uh

777
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,980
yeah I I saw you know the lemon G for

778
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,319
the longest time or let me start by

779
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,720
saying actually first uh there's a G13

780
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,898
clone that's gone around this area for a

781
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,419
long time since I was in school still my

782
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:45,418
parents my friend's parents grew it and

783
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:49,679
my other friend's parents grew it and um

784
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:51,059
eventually I got it and that thing is I

785
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,580
thought for sure that is what was used

786
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:55,740
for lemon G because you could smell

787
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:57,178
that in the lemon G like it's obvious

788
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,798
you could smell that plant and the lemon

789
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:01,019
G it's like okay these both came from

790
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,519
the same state you know they smell

791
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:03,839
related they're probably related so I

792
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,918
just always figured that's kind of what

793
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,139
it was

794
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,240
but um and I don't know what that it's a

795
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,299
what that G13 plant I don't know if it's

796
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,519
an Airborne G13 cut from the forums or

797
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:17,278
whatever I'm not sure it's just a short

798
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,119
little stubby Afghan

799
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,538
um

800
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:24,058
it's not really like it's nothing really

801
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:25,980
a lot of people would prefer to smoke or

802
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:28,139
grow these days I feel yeah it's more

803
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,960
like your head stash unique old-school

804
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,240
Afghani type of type of stuff but like a

805
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,159
little soapy a little like it's been a

806
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,298
while since I smelled it I lost it you

807
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,000
know when I went through that whole

808
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:40,139
dudding scenario unfortunately

809
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,640
um I

810
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,559
it's just one I've never been able to

811
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,120
get back I've been looking several times

812
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:47,099
right like people have given you stuff

813
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:50,099
back and it turned out not to be it

814
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:52,740
uh I mean I think maybe once with the G

815
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,418
but okay the G is pretty easy to spot

816
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,859
like if you get a clone of that and it

817
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,179
veggies up a little even a little bit

818
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:58,619
you know you might even be able to tell

819
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,620
from clone like it's a really unique

820
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:03,479
plant oh wow um short squat little

821
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,178
Afghani but we can talk about that in a

822
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,038
little bit if you want yeah okay I used

823
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:10,380
to talk about it and when we were

824
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:12,000
looking he would send me pics and we

825
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,700
would always kind of like Wonder is it

826
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,619
like is it Airborne is it Pacific is it

827
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,278
something more ancient than that that

828
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:21,959
like survived where he's at and I will

829
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,880
say that like if you look at some of the

830
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,759
Neville's few picks that he put up of

831
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,980
the classic G13 clone

832
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:34,140
it kind of had that like gnarly ancient

833
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,240
Afghani ugly look to it I thought it

834
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,038
looked very similar for lack of a better

835
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,599
turn that's not distant you know there's

836
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,000
plenty of weed that I think is kind of

837
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:45,240
ugly that I actually love to smoke chem

838
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,519
91 the ugliest plant ever it's not the

839
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,159
ugliest plant ever but on Earth

840
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,139
no there is definitely some Haze that I

841
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,320
find that I find attractive that is way

842
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,100
more hideous

843
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,599
you know you're like oh this thing

844
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:01,319
doesn't have any Crystal it doesn't have

845
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,658
any sugar Leaf it's loose it's calyx's

846
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,639
it's [ __ ] you know and then

847
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,620
uh yeah I curse but we're in the middle

848
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,000
of it

849
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:11,219
all right you're good we're after a

850
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,500
minute in

851
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,179
but maybe so that we we chatted about

852
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,859
the lemon G for a second why don't we

853
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,480
chat yeah the other thing you got early

854
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,658
that you really love which is the Death

855
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,399
Star oh yeah which is a classic it has a

856
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,440
great name and it's been consistently

857
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,599
one of your favorites basically from now

858
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,620
to then it really hasn't shifted

859
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,398
yeah

860
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:34,259
yeah the Death Star is my All-Star I've

861
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,058
loved that plant since the day I got it

862
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:37,919
the day I smoked it I was so happy the

863
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:40,740
day I got it

864
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,259
um you know I only had probably at that

865
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,899
point like 10 or 12 plants in my

866
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:47,759
collection and it just completely

867
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:50,158
kicked them all out of the water you

868
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,619
know I I like that that hardcore like

869
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,500
potency like knock you down put you into

870
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,879
the couch type of stuff and uh and

871
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,159
that's the effects you get off the Death

872
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,919
Star but you know you also get the super

873
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:06,080
crazy like oniony tennis ball like

874
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:09,179
rubber gas like skunk like nastiness

875
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,519
everything's there and you grow a killer

876
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:14,038
people don't understand like I've had

877
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,898
shitty Death Star like where it's grown

878
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,398
to where there's not very much burnt

879
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:20,398
rubber at all where it's more of that

880
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:22,379
oniony spicy back end and it's not very

881
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,199
good but then I've had your death star

882
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,140
where it just kicks its ass so when he's

883
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,640
describing this if if if it smells

884
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,320
different than what he's describing it

885
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,240
because he's grown it very very very

886
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,278
well for a very long time so go ahead

887
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,200
continue please on the history of Death

888
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,819
Star okay

889
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,399
um I I guess where do I start I guess

890
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:42,720
I'll start at uh Team Death Star right

891
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,058
yeah yeah

892
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,038
um they're from Ohio Columbus area

893
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:50,339
and they are the people that created the

894
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:53,158
Death Star the Death Star is a cross of

895
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:55,558
uh Scentsy star and

896
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,620
um Sour Diesel

897
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,418
and they it was an accidental

898
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,219
pollination I guess

899
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,899
um and they had a couple seeds and they

900
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,058
sprouted them and they picked the Death

901
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:07,259
Star and one of those few seeds that

902
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:09,838
they sprouted

903
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:11,280
was this amazing plant

904
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,500
um

905
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,899
and I was so lucky I was so lucky to get

906
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,179
it in the mid-2000s at the time when I

907
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:21,898
had you know only been growing for for

908
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:24,139
five years or something like that and I

909
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:27,000
was just so

910
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:29,159
intrigued by this plant and how potent

911
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,960
it was and how much yield it put out so

912
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,240
I just started putting it in all my

913
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,679
rooms basically that I had that I had

914
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,598
flowering and I just started growing and

915
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,980
growing it growing it and it I mean

916
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,899
there's people at my door with

917
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,940
pitchforks you know three weeks before

918
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:44,819
Harvest like where's it we need it we

919
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:48,179
need it it was it was scary it just it

920
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,639
just it flew off the shelves yeah

921
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,780
um and I enjoyed I was smoking it all

922
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,899
the time

923
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,960
I bet uh but yeah so that it came from

924
00:34:54,898 --> 00:35:00,719
uh from them they got uh

925
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,960
the the sour diesel cut they got I think

926
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,598
came from fish show in Vermont

927
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,358
back in like uh I forget the date it was

928
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,460
like 2004 I think fish did like a

929
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:14,039
farewell show at a airport in Vermont

930
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,300
and um and they picked up I don't know

931
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,559
if they picked it up in Vermont or if

932
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,560
they picked it up back along the way

933
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,599
from Vermont to Ohio but along that trip

934
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,578
is when they acquired that and then um

935
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,859
from what I've heard of another friend

936
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,740
of theirs went to Amsterdam and got

937
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:30,960
seeds and came back and um I guess they

938
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:33,539
were grown and a selection was made and

939
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,980
that was given to team death star by a

940
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:39,059
friend of theirs and then that's how the

941
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,219
cross got the Death Star got made okay

942
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:43,019
one of the things maybe I should mention

943
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:46,019
because it's like a long-term running

944
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:49,139
joke but it ties into what Matt and pip

945
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:52,440
were just discussing is that um

946
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:55,379
you know it it takes probably a good 84

947
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,179
days right uh you know I mean that's

948
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,400
that's about that's that's what I push

949
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:01,319
it to like you can pull it at 77 days I

950
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,358
mean a lot of people told it 70 days

951
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,400
that's where a lot a lot of people make

952
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,019
that's the point I'm gonna make is that

953
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,420
one of the differences and one of the

954
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:12,599
reasons why it might be so good from pip

955
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,180
versus other people is that you know he

956
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,280
was willing to actually see like how

957
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:19,919
long does this thing need to go before

958
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,720
it hits Perfection and what happens like

959
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,119
and this used to happen with sour diesel

960
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,039
a lot in California is that there's

961
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,559
people that would grow it until it hit

962
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,719
the sweet spot and there's people that

963
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,219
would grow it until it hit good enough

964
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,500
for Market

965
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:36,659
and there's a vast difference that like

966
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,460
say you might be able to cut off like he

967
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,159
was just saying if you cut that star at

968
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,300
70 it might fly out the door but not be

969
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,299
as nice

970
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,760
and pip would take it an extra two weeks

971
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,500
and it would reach this extra level

972
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,540
and I think the same thing would happen

973
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,519
with sour out west it would happen with

974
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:55,559
some other Cuts where it was like there

975
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:57,420
was croppers where like as soon as it

976
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,420
had the nose and was good enough to go

977
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,980
it's time to cut it yeah because there's

978
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,920
a lot of people that don't like taking

979
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:07,199
anything over nine or ten weeks

980
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,240
you know and sometimes not with

981
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,799
everything sometimes you go downhill but

982
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:12,899
with some things if you give it that

983
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,859
extra week or two

984
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,539
um it makes a huge difference

985
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:21,598
you know it lets the potency and the

986
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,820
flavor and some of the depth come out

987
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,500
um and uh you know so I think when Matt

988
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,940
was talking about all this Death Star

989
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,639
sucks there was probably a lot of death

990
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,338
star that was cut at 10 that needed to

991
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:35,400
go 12. I'm sure there was a lot cut at

992
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:38,279
seven and it needed to go 12 too earlier

993
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,260
you cut it you know the the less nuance

994
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,660
and depth it'll have

995
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,640
so yeah

996
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:47,039
uh one thing else I wanted to add too is

997
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,598
when this accidental cross happened I

998
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,759
believe it actually pollinated some

999
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,500
other plants as well they had uh the

1000
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,660
Indiana bubble gum which was a clone I

1001
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,480
had at this time as well it was popular

1002
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:59,699
around here uh and they had the dumpster

1003
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,338
which is a popular one from you know

1004
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,739
back in the day around here and I think

1005
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:06,779
those were both pollinated uh because

1006
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:09,419
when I was at you know the Festival

1007
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,880
Nelson Ledges in you know the mid-2000s

1008
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,760
I was seeing these strains called Bubble

1009
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,380
star and dump star yeah I think there

1010
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,420
was maybe one or two more that I can't

1011
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,960
recall right now but I definitely

1012
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:24,240
remember seeing a lot of the bubble star

1013
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,740
um I remember the Death Star was a

1014
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,299
little bit difficult to get and I think

1015
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,919
the Scentsy star was a little bit

1016
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,839
difficult to get as well I don't think

1017
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,940
it was just like lots of it you know

1018
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,920
yeah kind of like

1019
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,780
you mentioned dumpster Yeah you

1020
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,639
mentioned dumpster Ohioans are going to

1021
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,680
want to hear about dumpster can you rep

1022
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,598
Ohio's dumpster for us what the hell is

1023
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,899
dumpster does it smell like a dumpster

1024
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,900
was it really found in a dumpster

1025
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,400
what's the story bro oh that's

1026
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,720
I haven't heard it from the horse's

1027
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,820
mouth I've heard a lot of things over

1028
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:56,039
the year and it's it's all generally

1029
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,900
lines up you know things get left out

1030
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:01,940
over the years things get added I guess

1031
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:04,320
so take it whatever I say as is but

1032
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,599
supposedly it was uh there was a couple

1033
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,599
of guys growing together one of them was

1034
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,880
known as the professor okay and I was

1035
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,220
told that they basically had a falling

1036
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,599
out and they were they were growing this

1037
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:18,118
plant and then they had a falling out

1038
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,559
and they threw this whole room away into

1039
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,300
a chat the one guy threw the whole room

1040
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,099
away into a trash can or something and

1041
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,960
then the other guy went back and got the

1042
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,740
cut that they were growing out of the

1043
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,619
dumpster and called it dumpster all

1044
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:34,019
right yeah so I mean that's that's just

1045
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,960
what I've heard I'm not 100 yeah I know

1046
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:38,338
there's more details um I do have some

1047
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,720
connections I can get more details on

1048
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:45,000
that from but uh you know I think

1049
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,679
what did I what did I say it it kind of

1050
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,079
It kind of reminds me of like the

1051
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,679
there's a garlic Bud pick and have you

1052
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:55,019
ever seen that what is it 1989 yep yeah

1053
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:57,598
it's the seed bank right it kind of

1054
00:39:55,019 --> 00:40:00,539
reminds me a lot of dumpster it's really

1055
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,400
it's it's almost dead on that leaf and

1056
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:06,300
everything it just looks you know just

1057
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,519
like it yeah uh so I've heard people say

1058
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:11,039
it's you know Shiva skunk you know nl5

1059
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,599
skunk one

1060
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,179
um I mean there was a lot of that sold

1061
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,800
so yeah I mean definitely possible I

1062
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,239
mean the other interesting part just

1063
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,880
real quick before we get up on that

1064
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,578
tangent is that at the seed bank Neville

1065
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,920
called this line garlic bud and then

1066
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,599
when it and then when Scentsy seeds sold

1067
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,760
the same line when they bought his

1068
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,160
company they called it Shiva Shanti

1069
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,660
right you know

1070
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,598
um and so there could be some truth to

1071
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:38,819
both it could you know pip and I have

1072
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,240
chatted about it does very much look

1073
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:44,160
like sort of an old NL skunk type hybrid

1074
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,139
of some kind

1075
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,679
you know what does it smell like what's

1076
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:53,460
the chirp profile uh I I classify it as

1077
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:55,379
like it's like a a sweet pineapple with

1078
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,380
like that toe jam Funk there's like a

1079
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,358
funk in it too you know uh that's kind

1080
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,480
of that's kind of like where I lie with

1081
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,219
it it's it's uh it's good smoke it's

1082
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,838
decent it's it's I mean to be honest

1083
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:08,759
it's just average smoke it's a

1084
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:10,679
commercial just typical like a

1085
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,900
commercial type variety a lot of people

1086
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,879
did a lot of grows of dumpster in Ohio

1087
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:18,119
over the years and oh yeah because it

1088
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,338
yields like crazy but um it does get big

1089
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,680
buds it's a little bit prone to mold you

1090
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:24,000
gotta watch out

1091
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,098
um

1092
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,500
but overall it's I mean it's a staple in

1093
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,740
Ohio it's been around for 20 years or

1094
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,599
whatever now so

1095
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:36,000
there was a there was a fake one that

1096
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,059
went around Ohio I think Jason mentioned

1097
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,119
it in his books it was called chumster

1098
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:44,099
with a CA with a CH trumpster yeah uh I

1099
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,720
personally never saw that one but I just

1100
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,980
figured I would mention it

1101
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:52,019
uh and it was mostly run in Toledo back

1102
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,460
in the day I believe at first and that's

1103
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:54,719
like we're like the professor and all

1104
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,099
that stuff was but I've also heard

1105
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,259
people say that there was a guy in

1106
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:59,940
Columbus uh and that's where this whole

1107
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,859
situation happened as well so I'm just

1108
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,700
not 100 sure but that's kind of where

1109
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:08,039
I'm at uh with the dumpster cool yep how

1110
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:09,838
about the um Afghani mango I know that's

1111
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:13,500
another older classic

1112
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:16,679
oh man The Afghani mango Afghan Diego

1113
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,619
yep I got that uh I got that around

1114
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,259
again around mid-2000s uh from my buddy

1115
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:24,059
uh it was one of his favorite ones and I

1116
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,460
remember going over to his house one day

1117
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:29,219
he was living up in Akron

1118
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,139
and I walk in and I smell the smell I'm

1119
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:32,879
like man that smells I mean that is

1120
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:34,559
really unique what are you smoking he's

1121
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,539
like I'm smoking Afghan mango and he was

1122
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,019
smoking it out of his Volcano Vaporizer

1123
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:41,420
oh nice so he gave me some Puffs and I

1124
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:43,679
smoked it and the flavor was

1125
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:48,180
unbelievable it was just like this like

1126
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:50,219
soft mango a little bit of a sweet for

1127
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:53,098
sure a little bit of like metallic smell

1128
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,539
in there as well I feel like yeah it was

1129
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,920
just super interesting and then he you

1130
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:57,539
know brought me upstairs and showed me

1131
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,980
like two or three lights in an upstairs

1132
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,079
bedroom

1133
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,920
a little window AC or something and a

1134
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,019
fan

1135
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,460
and he had uh he had it growing up there

1136
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:07,318
and it was just such a unique looking

1137
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,179
plant I I mean I'd really never seen

1138
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,619
anything like it up until this point I

1139
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:12,960
was growing a lot of like kind of more

1140
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:15,240
like Indica dominant stuff whereas The

1141
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,699
Afghani mango is definitely a little bit

1142
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,618
more sativa it makes these long Spears

1143
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:22,500
that kind of like aren't thick but they

1144
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:24,900
fill in they're just like long Spears

1145
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,179
and uh and I ran it for ran it for quite

1146
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,740
a while but it could be finicky uh it

1147
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:30,960
does this weird thing it'll stunt out

1148
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:32,039
sometimes uh like kind of like fail to

1149
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,000
start

1150
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:35,880
um

1151
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,800
and then it also if if the conditions

1152
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,660
aren't perfect it can tend to like harm

1153
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,220
a lot or like if one plant in the room

1154
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:43,578
is like buy the fan constantly getting

1155
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,559
beat up the whole time like it can hurt

1156
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,839
so I never really did large runs of it

1157
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,818
it's been a commercial Ohio strain for a

1158
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:54,119
long time lots of people have done big

1159
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:55,380
big runs of uh Afghan mango and pass it

1160
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,539
around the state over the years and

1161
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,740
stuff but it's just a it's a super

1162
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:01,139
unique one

1163
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:04,618
um I don't know exactly what it is I've

1164
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:06,118
I've you know I've seen uh Angel's

1165
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:08,460
breath and like I've told you before

1166
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,619
Matt by Mr Nice and Angel heart and that

1167
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,539
and it kind of looks very similar to

1168
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:14,400
that but um I know you've mentioned to

1169
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:16,318
me that those are relatively recent

1170
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,079
releases within the past 10 11 years

1171
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,358
yeah and I've had the Afghan mango for

1172
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,400
you know for longer than that obviously

1173
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,858
so yeah yeah I guess that would you know

1174
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,019
that would kind of nullify it but I

1175
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:30,000
don't know 100 super unique plant it's

1176
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:33,480
been around Ohio for a long time

1177
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
KC 33 maybe always an option

1178
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,000
um KC mango I'm not sure oh yeah the the

1179
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,179
Casey brains stuff yeah you know that's

1180
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,318
older and I mean it was it was grown a

1181
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,118
lot because it was one of the more

1182
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:47,460
affordable lines but there was great

1183
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,380
great stuff in it like amazing stuff in

1184
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,920
it a lot of breeders ended up knocking

1185
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,720
it off later on too uh BC's BC mangoes

1186
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,700
based on that one I'll have to take a

1187
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,858
look into that yeah yeah it might be

1188
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:00,239
another Direction yeah I thought I've

1189
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:01,920
talked to a lot of people you know a lot

1190
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,659
of local people people in the Wii game

1191
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,280
over the years and I always ask about

1192
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,659
Afghan mango because it's one of the

1193
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,940
ones that I have the least information

1194
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:10,618
about yeah I don't know who made it I

1195
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,539
don't know if they made it if they

1196
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:14,940
bought seeds of it from a company when

1197
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:17,039
it came around

1198
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,318
um it's definitely you know early to mid

1199
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,599
2000s areas where I would put it put

1200
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:23,219
that one we've got to ask Konza where he

1201
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,099
sourced his seeds

1202
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:28,259
see if he has any kind of

1203
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,240
anything on it

1204
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,839
you're here to talk to him about it

1205
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,259
no yeah I haven't either ask him no

1206
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:39,059
okay so we go from

1207
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:41,579
we haven't done four-way have we

1208
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:43,858
uh I don't believe we have let's hit

1209
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:47,640
four-way all right

1210
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:50,639
the uh the four-way

1211
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:53,338
I had I had originally gotten a plant

1212
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:56,699
back in before I don't know the exact

1213
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:57,559
date 2014 15 16 somewhere around there

1214
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:00,419
probably

1215
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,519
uh I had gotten a plant from

1216
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,039
a friend of a friend and it was called

1217
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:08,940
uh Scentsy star

1218
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:10,559
and I grew it and I realized I had

1219
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,599
smoked this before you know but I

1220
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,400
couldn't it's been so long I couldn't

1221
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,039
tell you know like is this a Scentsy

1222
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,358
star I smoked or you know so so I had

1223
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,219
grown it for years and I had liked it

1224
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,838
and I after growing it a couple times I

1225
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:22,980
really noticed a lot of similarities to

1226
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,099
the Death Star because I think they're

1227
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,440
on Death Star forever yeah uh it kind of

1228
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,960
has that like little zigzag uh structure

1229
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,599
it does and some of the Aromas in it as

1230
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,119
well kind of uh kind of are very similar

1231
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,099
so you know I actually thought for a

1232
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,740
long time that it actually was the the

1233
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:42,599
plant that was used uh to make dust on

1234
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:45,059
our pot sure absolutely

1235
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,960
but uh recently I found you know I was

1236
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:48,179
wrong

1237
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,920
um Death Star I've grown test RS ones

1238
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:52,440
and I've definitely seen the S1 tragedy

1239
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,900
and it's pretty pretty clear now that

1240
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,159
they are uh you know Scentsy stardom in

1241
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,480
it uh

1242
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:59,699
so

1243
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,639
um I feel like it's related the the

1244
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:05,699
four-way my cut what you know is related

1245
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:09,239
somehow whether it's part of Scentsy

1246
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:11,098
star or a component of it was used to

1247
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:13,979
make Sensei star or something like that

1248
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:16,019
you know yeah uh so that's kind of like

1249
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,800
that's kind of where I

1250
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:21,838
where I'm at now with with that I I grew

1251
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,900
that Scentsy star for years and then

1252
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,699
eventually along the way I had gotten

1253
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,980
plants under different names

1254
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,539
um such as it's if they were the same

1255
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,280
plant as my Scentsy star I got it under

1256
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,858
the name of death star from some people

1257
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,720
I got it under the name of four-way from

1258
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:38,039
the guy I got it under the name of you

1259
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:39,659
know all this different stuff and every

1260
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:41,699
time over the years I throw it out I'm

1261
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:43,440
like oh my gosh it's the same plan again

1262
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:45,539
like why this is the one that you kept

1263
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,000
getting back it's different oh my gosh

1264
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:49,980
it was it was crazy

1265
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,579
so you know fast forward several years

1266
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:55,980
after that a couple years ago I I was

1267
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:58,980
looking I reached out to a friend of her

1268
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:01,079
of a friend who had a friend

1269
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,679
um who said that they had the Ohio

1270
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:07,200
four-way clone that used to go around

1271
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,419
so I I get in contact with him I go over

1272
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,598
to his house and he's a super cool guy a

1273
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,159
little bit older and he shows me a jar

1274
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,619
of the flower and

1275
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,420
and I kind of like you know saw the

1276
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:19,980
resemblance I was like almost like this

1277
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,200
is that same plan again but I wasn't

1278
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,818
sure and then he took me downstairs into

1279
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,618
his little Hut and he had like a light

1280
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,480
with like you know three or four plants

1281
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,818
and they weren't in the best shape they

1282
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,559
had some thrips on them and stuff uh but

1283
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:35,338
it just wasn't the best representation

1284
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:37,078
so I wasn't 100 sure yet yeah so um so

1285
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:38,519
anyway he you know he gave me the cut

1286
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,079
and I brought him some stuff too because

1287
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,480
he's from a small circle he doesn't have

1288
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,180
access to a bunch of stuff so sure I

1289
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,740
gave him some cool stuff to grow and I

1290
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:49,139
went and you know grew this thing out

1291
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:50,879
and uh when we were talking and smoking

1292
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:53,400
is flour when I met up with him he told

1293
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,900
me that he's had it for 20 years and

1294
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,880
that one of his buddies was the guy that

1295
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,338
bought the seeds and made the selection

1296
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,039
back in the day wow yeah and he

1297
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:04,619
originally said uh you know the guy that

1298
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:06,900
I met uh that I got the cut from said

1299
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:08,640
that it was from Scentsy seeds but I had

1300
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,680
him actually contact his buddy the guy

1301
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,659
who you know and he confirmed that he

1302
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:14,818
said he got him from Nirvana oh

1303
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,519
interesting yeah so yeah

1304
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,420
um so you know

1305
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:20,280
Nirvana's description is slightly

1306
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,139
different from Scentsy seeds but you

1307
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,900
know they did a lot of work with other

1308
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:26,940
people's lines back in the day so it

1309
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,920
wouldn't be surprising to me if it was

1310
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,380
more than likely to sensei's work that

1311
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,700
they were using that's probably the most

1312
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,220
you know

1313
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,480
you know and Nirvana was probably I

1314
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,059
probably would have bought Nirvana's

1315
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,059
over scentsies during you know during

1316
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,619
those Early Air that early era because

1317
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:46,500
Nirvana's was always like 90 whereas

1318
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:48,800
since these was like 240 you know is it

1319
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,800
right yeah

1320
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,880
Nirvana verifiably took various lines

1321
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,460
from Scentsy

1322
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,900
um and reprode them and made and gave

1323
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,240
them their own names I mean they

1324
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,539
famously took Neville's nl2 and called

1325
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,159
it Oasis that's the fashion oh that's

1326
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:06,838
Dutch Passion yeah I mean it was it was

1327
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:08,639
very common yeah

1328
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:10,440
um and all that and then one thing we

1329
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,659
probably should mention about the about

1330
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,119
the Scentsy star itself is that even

1331
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:17,699
though it came out in 1995

1332
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,480
uh we still don't know what the heck it

1333
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:20,059
is

1334
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,119
right yeah

1335
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:28,078
he's he's been extremely uh reluctant to

1336
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:30,539
mention any parentage uh as far as uh

1337
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,460
the guy who owns paradise and you know

1338
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:35,159
what else I found interesting was in 95

1339
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:37,740
Scentsy seeds um re-released the

1340
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,920
four-way uh I don't know what they mean

1341
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:43,019
by that uh but in 1995 they did and then

1342
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,300
a year after in 96 I believe was when

1343
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:47,699
Paradise started and released the

1344
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,960
Scentsy Star right yeah I believe so

1345
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:50,759
that's what was actually released pretty

1346
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,380
pretty close together so yeah I don't

1347
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,359
know I mean can't prove anything but you

1348
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,940
know it's just uh like I said it's

1349
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:59,219
possible that uh that four-way was used

1350
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,200
or that one of the components that make

1351
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:03,179
up four-way was possibly used you know

1352
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,460
and that's coming through expressing

1353
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:06,838
yeah was was Afghan T in four way it

1354
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,280
took a long time for us to figure out

1355
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,460
and then it was one of those things that

1356
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:14,700
was hiding in plain sight where uh

1357
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:16,380
Neville wrote in his 87 update to his

1358
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:18,719
catalog that he was about to release

1359
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:22,680
this strain called four-way and it was

1360
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:26,399
Big Bud nl1 by early Pearl skunk one

1361
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,899
that's right it was original yeah and um

1362
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,579
and so it was another one of those

1363
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,318
things that like pip and I and others we

1364
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:34,019
hunted and hunted and hunted forever

1365
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:36,719
looking for any information on what what

1366
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:37,858
actually the makeup was

1367
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,358
um and then it was one of those things

1368
00:51:37,858 --> 00:51:41,519
that was just like hiding in plain sight

1369
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,259
if you knew where to look

1370
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,739
um and so it was honestly one of those

1371
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:50,099
like the 90s was a lot of f1s but that

1372
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:52,459
was an early poly hybrid

1373
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:55,619
um you know because I believe

1374
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:58,260
uh I believe Neville released both of

1375
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:00,720
those plants that made up four-way as

1376
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:04,079
separate strains big bud nl1 just became

1377
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,939
the big bud line and early Pearl skunk

1378
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,800
one I believe got released as Early

1379
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,139
Skunk

1380
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,700
you know so it was already lined he was

1381
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:13,078
playing with separately to begin with

1382
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:14,759
and then he took two of them and

1383
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,500
combined them together yeah and there

1384
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,940
you go and so obviously as a four-way

1385
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,059
hybrid

1386
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,679
um it could lean in different directions

1387
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:24,839
um and especially amongst the progeny

1388
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,838
and stuff like that but

1389
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:30,058
um yeah so I wanted to clarify uh today

1390
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:32,940
if you go on their website Cincy seeds

1391
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:35,819
labels it as Indian by Afghanistan by

1392
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,200
Pakistan by Skunk one I don't know I

1393
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:39,000
don't I don't know when this was

1394
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,219
released it's not in any of their 90s

1395
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,579
catalogs

1396
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:47,639
um but they did use in 1987 Neville did

1397
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:49,318
the up Senate update for his 87 catalog

1398
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:51,118
right and he said he was gonna you know

1399
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:53,279
have a four-way hybrid the next year he

1400
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,079
comes out with four and more and that's

1401
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,140
the only year it comes out and then two

1402
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:00,599
years go by 89 and 90 and it's not in

1403
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:03,000
the catalog and then in 91 since he sees

1404
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:05,460
comes along and releases four-way and

1405
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,719
they use the same exact description that

1406
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:11,579
Neville used for his foreign

1407
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,919
finish time same verbiage in the

1408
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:15,839
description

1409
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,420
all that type of stuff so yeah Clues

1410
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:19,799
like that you know um and you know I

1411
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,358
mean we don't know like you know there's

1412
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,940
all there's some other famous cuts out

1413
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,460
there there's the Fairfax four-way that

1414
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,318
supposedly was from the same line

1415
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,179
um but you know obviously like if you

1416
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,440
get a four-way hybrid

1417
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:34,139
um it could lean in a number of

1418
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,519
different directions you know right one

1419
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:37,318
thing I wanted to pull on real quick

1420
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,358
because I wasn't clear on it when you

1421
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:41,579
were talking about the the the the

1422
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:44,699
bubble Style are and some of that stuff

1423
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:47,400
yeah um was that made with Death Star

1424
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:49,139
pollen or was that made with pollen from

1425
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,160
maybe like the East Coast Sour Diesel

1426
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:55,078
that threw on some of those other plants

1427
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:57,058
it was the Scentsy star that threw it

1428
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:01,019
was the Sensei so the Scentsy star was

1429
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:03,839
the was the the dad if you will yes the

1430
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:05,639
Scentsy the Scentsy star threw the

1431
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,279
Scentsy star through okay so that's

1432
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:09,900
where that's where bubbles star and some

1433
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,760
of those other hybrids you were talking

1434
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,318
about that you would see floating around

1435
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,839
came from

1436
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:17,219
uh yeah it definitely I feel like it

1437
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,039
definitely came from that same

1438
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:22,259
accidental pollination or I don't say

1439
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,460
accidental I've heard that they saw that

1440
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,500
the Scentsy star was kind of making

1441
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,240
pollen and they kind of used it and

1442
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:31,619
sprinkled it is what I've heard as well

1443
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:34,618
who knows what happened but um but yeah

1444
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:37,680
early feminized seed used to be like you

1445
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:40,680
know uh you know you know plant gets

1446
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,759
stressed accidental pollen flies and

1447
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:44,639
then all of a sudden you have some

1448
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,920
feminized backseat right long before we

1449
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:48,838
figured out STS or any of these other

1450
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,180
methods that modern where you're using

1451
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:52,980
in modern times

1452
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:54,899
you know

1453
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,659
I don't know Matt's smiling over there

1454
00:54:54,900 --> 00:55:00,000
or whatever but

1455
00:54:56,659 --> 00:55:02,399
but yeah I mean you know for old people

1456
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,559
like me we used to think that that

1457
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,240
accidental pollination like if you use

1458
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,160
that you were cheating and it would

1459
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,919
probably ruin the line because it was

1460
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,960
made not the natural way that was a big

1461
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,579
belief back in the day it was a big

1462
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,858
belief you're like oh you're going to

1463
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:18,839
use some herb accident stuff you're

1464
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:20,578
gonna probably like imprint that into

1465
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:23,659
your seed line and you'll never get it

1466
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:23,660
out and it'll be worse

1467
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,639
um so that just goes to show how

1468
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:29,400
ignorant we were at the time we were

1469
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:32,279
convinced that you know that huh yeah

1470
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,559
the other day Caleb made a post and I

1471
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,900
it drives me nuts absolutely nuts when I

1472
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,240
see this but it's the typical what I

1473
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:42,300
call the typical hippie response to like

1474
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:45,179
a feminized seed post is like ha see

1475
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:48,180
like it was it was CSI posting about a a

1476
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:49,858
reversal failure right huh because

1477
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:52,078
because you were you were messing with

1478
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:54,239
nature is what what happened there and

1479
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:57,599
then I had to point out you know the

1480
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,639
nature wants these plants intersex it's

1481
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:03,780
because man's intervened that they're

1482
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:05,519
regular seeds so actually actually if

1483
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,440
you really want to get technical they're

1484
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,780
taking it back and it's just like this

1485
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,480
really bad logical argument that they

1486
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:15,559
seem to have in their heads that herming

1487
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,300
is us being bad

1488
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:19,280
weed used to be very Bro Science

1489
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,960
yeah

1490
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,579
there used to be a lot of Bro Science

1491
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,800
and what I mean by that is just stuff

1492
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:28,200
that gets passed around in smoking

1493
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,059
circles and stuff like that and I mean

1494
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:31,439
I've talked about it on previous shows

1495
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:34,079
where we used to put our best Mexican

1496
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,858
butt in the resin chamber so it would

1497
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,859
gain equality

1498
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,659
Mexican butt in your resin chamber and

1499
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,940
you don't smoke that one till the end

1500
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:47,219
and then this butt out and you thought

1501
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,679
that was an improvement so there was a

1502
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:52,318
lot of of misinformation in the 90s and

1503
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:54,598
early 2000s when the internet and and

1504
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:57,119
sort of like you know facts it was

1505
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:58,800
basically just a bunch of kids spreading

1506
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,140
what they heard from older people maybe

1507
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,539
or reading in High Times you know we

1508
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:04,980
used to think High Times was sort of the

1509
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:07,920
Bible

1510
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,838
they are now and uh then you get older

1511
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,800
and you're like oh man who takes that

1512
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,519
advice

1513
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,839
but it was a real era in that regard so

1514
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:19,858
you know

1515
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:21,299
um yeah so I mean four-way uh you know

1516
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:23,219
it it ended up being one of your

1517
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,039
favorite plants

1518
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:27,959
it did man it's uh it's just you know

1519
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:29,338
super unique super old school you can

1520
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,780
tell if you've been growing grown a lot

1521
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:32,759
of plants you can grow it and look at it

1522
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,640
and be like yeah that's definitely

1523
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,480
not from around this time period you

1524
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:38,279
know

1525
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,480
um definitely some like 90s weeds

1526
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,099
something like that I wasn't really

1527
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,719
growing or smoking in the 80s so I

1528
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,000
didn't see a lot of that stuff

1529
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,379
but I've seen enough stuff from you know

1530
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,239
back in the day to know when something's

1531
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,760
a little bit older and you know

1532
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,500
different than

1533
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,619
would you say that the the four-way the

1534
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:57,179
Ohio four-way is skunky at all yes

1535
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:59,640
that's interesting because that that

1536
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:01,679
Fairfax four-way like the one time when

1537
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:03,838
I got to because it was super dudded

1538
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,239
when I got it but um

1539
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:07,980
the one time I got to like get any hint

1540
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,598
of smell out of it you could smell like

1541
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,159
what direction it was going it's like oh

1542
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,838
wow this does have potential to be as

1543
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:14,699
skunky as they've talked about it really

1544
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:19,078
does so I was wondering if the other

1545
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:21,419
it's cut does it's the I don't know the

1546
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:23,339
the four-way that I have is it's not as

1547
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,680
skunky as like the Death Star you know

1548
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:28,380
it doesn't it's not like that uh it's

1549
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:30,779
it's milder than the Death Star yeah but

1550
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,640
it's got more like other stuff in it you

1551
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,400
know it's like that like

1552
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:37,500
I don't know how to that old world likes

1553
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:41,220
those old world smells you know like

1554
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:43,318
kind of stuff like that hashy spicy uh

1555
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:46,318
you know skunky

1556
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:48,719
stuff going on in there yeah definitely

1557
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,519
the one the other one was like um had

1558
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:51,899
oniony in it too that was the other

1559
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:54,000
smell that could really smell yeah

1560
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:56,338
definitely but there's some stuff about

1561
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,559
that four-way certain things about it

1562
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:00,659
that remind me of stuff you'd see from

1563
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,760
afghanista so I always found that

1564
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:05,219
interesting based on what's in it

1565
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,200
I don't really see Afghan t in it unless

1566
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:08,639
Afghan teas and skunk wand or something

1567
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,058
like that which is something that I'd

1568
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:15,179
always like to dig further into

1569
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:16,859
yeah I mean it it uh it was it was one

1570
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:19,798
of those confusing things for a really

1571
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:21,598
long time because Neville was one of the

1572
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:24,298
only guys that just sort of laid out

1573
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,980
what was in his stuff all that second

1574
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:28,380
wave of breeders pretty much

1575
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:31,858
intentionally obscured

1576
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:34,079
uh genetics which for like his people

1577
00:59:31,858 --> 00:59:35,940
like us who are a little younger younger

1578
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,460
than that and historians trying to

1579
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,619
figure out what they used

1580
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,059
um even 25 30 years later some of those

1581
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:43,920
people don't want to just come off it

1582
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:46,619
like what would it what would it matter

1583
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,358
if Luke came out and you know and said

1584
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:53,220
this is what I used to make Scentsy star

1585
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:55,739
in 1995. yeah I don't know you know like

1586
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:58,078
big secret oh can't let that out you

1587
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:00,419
know like and but to this day it's still

1588
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,180
kind of like ah what's it what is it you

1589
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:05,760
know as of this year as recent as this

1590
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:07,679
year he will not say unfortunately I I'd

1591
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,960
love to have him on to to talk about it

1592
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,000
but yeah we've been getting declined

1593
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,740
that's that's been around Robin and you

1594
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,119
know it's one of those things where for

1595
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:17,039
a lot of people it's like if it doesn't

1596
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,260
benefit me why would I say it and it's

1597
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,818
like do I want to say that I like ripped

1598
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,260
it off from Neville or I got it from

1599
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:25,380
this other person that I never gave

1600
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:27,839
credit to or whatever the story may or

1601
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,920
may not be they'd prefer it to remain a

1602
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:30,358
mystery

1603
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,400
because it's not like anyone's going to

1604
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:34,619
go and like find the parents 25 years

1605
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,579
later 30 years later and like recreate

1606
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:38,039
it

1607
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:40,980
I mean that ship has sailed while we're

1608
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:45,298
in this territory let's hit my personal

1609
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:47,280
favorite the one like the the the bud

1610
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:50,579
that made me fall in love with pips

1611
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:54,079
grows the silver Pearl let's talk about

1612
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:54,079
that girl where did she come from

1613
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:59,160
um

1614
01:00:54,838 --> 01:01:01,380
uh the silver Pearl uh came from a local

1615
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,899
guy that actually got a hold of me on IG

1616
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,579
I think I met him I think we have a

1617
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,900
mutual friend as well

1618
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:10,559
um at the time

1619
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:12,420
and uh I'm not going to say either their

1620
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,280
names but sure yeah that's that's who I

1621
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,440
received it from uh

1622
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,900
preface of saying like our group has had

1623
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,579
this clone for a long time back in the

1624
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,500
day and I never grew it because I was so

1625
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:24,720
busy tied up with lemon G and death star

1626
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,699
like that was my yeah my show that was

1627
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:28,259
my Mo so like I didn't have time for

1628
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:29,699
anything else I already had 10 or 12

1629
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,880
plants that was more than enough for me

1630
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:34,379
being a Cropper yeah

1631
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,579
uh so I kind of always passed on it I

1632
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,960
would smoke it you know my friends would

1633
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:38,400
have it they'd bring it over and they'd

1634
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,079
bring it to our little you know cannabis

1635
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,079
cups that we had and stuff back in the

1636
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,059
day yeah up here in Akron

1637
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:46,980
um but I never really grew it and then

1638
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:48,720
as we got older you know how things go

1639
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:51,838
stuff gets lost it's not in the circle

1640
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,879
anymore and uh and I wanted to give it a

1641
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,159
riff so you know I was able to get in

1642
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,539
touch with this guy and he uh he had

1643
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,838
gotten it from an older gentleman who

1644
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:03,119
lived down Southern Ohio I believe

1645
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:05,400
and had it for quite a while and then uh

1646
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,140
you know I eventually acquired it from

1647
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,318
him you know gave him some stuff some

1648
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:12,659
seeds and I forget what else but uh it

1649
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:15,119
was it and a funny story is like a week

1650
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:16,500
later I got another plant uh that I was

1651
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,660
looking for I was looking for that G13

1652
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,400
you were talking about earlier and

1653
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:22,078
someone gave it to me and I grew it up

1654
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,298
and I knew before I even flowered it it

1655
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,280
was silver Pearl so I got silver Pearl

1656
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:28,199
twice in the same week from or basically

1657
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,880
different people from different people

1658
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:31,739
yeah

1659
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,900
one thing I'll say that's interesting

1660
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:37,379
about that cut is that and not

1661
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:40,380
everything does this but that cut grown

1662
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:43,318
out looks amazingly like some of the

1663
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,519
oldest pictures of silver Pearl that you

1664
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:46,318
can find I mean you know you don't want

1665
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:49,739
to use the word dead ringer too much or

1666
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:52,440
anything like that but boy uh visually

1667
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:54,239
does it look like it's it's just you

1668
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,519
know just walked out of the catalog and

1669
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:59,039
into your collection it really does it

1670
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,139
looks like if you were to look at at

1671
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,179
hips silver Pearl cut and you were to

1672
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:05,279
look at some of those old pictures of

1673
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:07,199
silver Pearl and you didn't know which

1674
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,960
was which you'd have a hard time telling

1675
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:12,480
the difference in some ways uh it really

1676
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,579
looks it really it really does resemble

1677
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,119
so that's not proof or anything like

1678
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:19,980
that but it certainly helps right right

1679
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,240
uh you know silver Pearl is just such a

1680
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,159
special plant

1681
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:25,979
um it's not like a narcotic hitter like

1682
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:27,719
I I prefer uh I respect all cannabis

1683
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,519
regardless of whether I enjoy it or not

1684
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:30,779
you know I gave it all a chance I enjoy

1685
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:32,519
all the different different aspects of

1686
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:35,220
it even if I'm not smoke again you know

1687
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:37,858
yeah but but the silver Pearl really

1688
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:41,039
grew on me uh when I first smoked it I

1689
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:42,598
was kind of I don't know off put by it

1690
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,699
because I wanted something you know hard

1691
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:46,140
hitting but after after smoking it for a

1692
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:47,818
while I'm giving it a chance and seeing

1693
01:03:46,139 --> 01:03:50,039
what it's really about

1694
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:52,079
uh you know smoking it fresh when you

1695
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:54,539
wake up in the morning uh you know

1696
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,420
nothing in your system you're fresh uh

1697
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:59,900
it's just I mean it's amazing it's

1698
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:04,318
really just really uplifting motivating

1699
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:06,358
happy you know bright Buzz uh on a you

1700
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:07,679
know it's very more like a city it's

1701
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:10,259
almost like what you think of like a

1702
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,239
sativa right but on a plant with this

1703
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:16,020
short and squat and finishes in you know

1704
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:18,419
50 days yeah yeah so it's I call the

1705
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:21,298
high electric maybe not not in the sense

1706
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:23,818
that it's um like giving you a rush but

1707
01:04:21,298 --> 01:04:25,139
it's bright and happy to me very bright

1708
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,358
and happy is the best way I could

1709
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:29,400
describe it in the in the the scent

1710
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:32,578
profile like me and not so describe it

1711
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,838
completely opposite and and it's really

1712
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:35,460
just two different takes on it but it's

1713
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:37,759
because of how complex it is how would

1714
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:41,280
you describe it

1715
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:43,140
oh uh I have a description I wrote of it

1716
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,660
somewhere I'll try to remember some but

1717
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:49,199
it's the basic smells are it's it's like

1718
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:51,179
a uh it's kind of like a sweet melon

1719
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,460
it's got a little bit of baby poo in

1720
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:55,919
there like that funk it's got the like

1721
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:59,519
the funky Funk flip funk I guess a

1722
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,260
little bit type thing it's got uh some

1723
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:06,440
like anise like almost like a black

1724
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:06,440
licorice type you know thing

1725
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:13,079
[Laughter]

1726
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:14,700
yeah I know like yeah I see for me when

1727
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,740
I smell it I smell like

1728
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:20,279
pink bubble gum is the first smell I

1729
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:21,899
smell and oh yeah D just grew it outdoor

1730
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,760
and I smelled it and I smelled it again

1731
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,559
and the first smell I smell is pink

1732
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,380
bubble gum but then there's like funky

1733
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:30,720
skunk background but not white it's just

1734
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:32,280
yeah it's got so much going on Matt that

1735
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,318
confuses a lot of people a lot of people

1736
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:37,079
have a hard time really like nailing it

1737
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:39,119
uh because there's just so much there's

1738
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:41,339
so much to it it's not like some of

1739
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,599
these there's just so many different I

1740
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:44,699
mean you can sit there and smell it for

1741
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:47,280
10 minutes straight and and pick out all

1742
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:49,558
the different it's uh it's just really

1743
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,660
really unique really awesome you know

1744
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:53,940
short flowering Indica like I said 50

1745
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:56,639
days not the biggest yield or in the

1746
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,500
world uh you gotta defoliate it it's a

1747
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,719
little bit you know like leafy throws

1748
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:03,298
fan leaves everywhere big fat indica and

1749
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,039
but it's gotta be great yeah got a great

1750
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:06,838
structure and you don't even have to I

1751
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,400
don't think I've ever netted or staked a

1752
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,259
silver Pearl plant in my life regardless

1753
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,000
of how big it's been I mean I grew up

1754
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:14,579
into like five gallons I don't go bigger

1755
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,260
than that but you know they it just so

1756
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:17,880
they support themselves like you don't

1757
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:20,520
even have to mess with them at all so

1758
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,619
good outdoor stuff uh one of the things

1759
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:25,079
that's interesting about it is that

1760
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:28,798
because pip mentioned it is that when he

1761
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:31,559
says baby poo I also get a strong baby

1762
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:35,038
poo smell off it but just to clarify

1763
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:37,619
like it smells to me like infant baby

1764
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:39,900
poo like when all their all they're on

1765
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,460
is Mother's Milk like they haven't

1766
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,500
gotten any kind of real food like

1767
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:46,139
because I I have a number of kids or

1768
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:49,199
whatever so like you know you familiar

1769
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:51,239
with that Raider but there's a very

1770
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,098
different smell to baby poo when they're

1771
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,899
one two three four months old whatever

1772
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:57,539
and all they're eating is Mommy's milk

1773
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,818
right then when they get actual real

1774
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:03,299
food so it doesn't smell like some kind

1775
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:05,579
of like gnarly kid poop it smells like

1776
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:07,318
this weird it's almost like one of those

1777
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:09,000
things to me where like if it wasn't in

1778
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:10,318
cannabis you would guarantee say it

1779
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,539
doesn't smell good

1780
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:14,279
but there's like smells in cannabis that

1781
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:17,039
smell weird but you like them but

1782
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:22,140
they're in weed and it's kind of caught

1783
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:23,220
that skunky sweet sickly baby poo and it

1784
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:25,500
doesn't sound maybe that doesn't sound

1785
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:28,259
too appetizing but it really is

1786
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,940
no I think it's a beautiful smell there

1787
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:32,160
is in the progeny

1788
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:34,200
um there is a little bit of mint and I

1789
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:37,139
can smell a slight hint of it in the mom

1790
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:39,538
but I got some nice uh nice selections I

1791
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:42,000
made that are like extremely like super

1792
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:43,740
minty you know wow it was uh it really

1793
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,239
you know threw me off guard surprised me

1794
01:07:43,739 --> 01:07:47,519
I also think it smells like a little bit

1795
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:50,519
some of them like like a Melanie a melon

1796
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:53,038
kind of you know uh it's just I mean

1797
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:54,780
it's got a lot going on man so what

1798
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:58,799
silver Pro is supposed to be according

1799
01:07:54,780 --> 01:08:02,160
to Neville is nl5 uh female the famous

1800
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:05,400
clone crossed with uh early Pearl skunk

1801
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:08,519
one male right and that is silver Pearl

1802
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,200
I mean I go ahead go ahead and one of

1803
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:13,440
the things since we were just talking

1804
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:15,298
about four-way I don't have any proof

1805
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,000
um I don't know how many different males

1806
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:19,140
Neville decided to use of early Pearl

1807
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,560
skunk one

1808
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:25,440
but it's somewhat possible that it could

1809
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,719
have the same dad as four-way it I mean

1810
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:30,358
anything's possible man you know because

1811
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:33,179
it's like it it's the same mix from the

1812
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:35,759
same guy yeah it's you know the dad is

1813
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:37,798
early Pearl skunk one in both the

1814
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:41,579
hybrids is it a different male but it's

1815
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:44,338
definitely the same line you know

1816
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:48,000
and that early Pearl is uh Early Girl

1817
01:08:44,338 --> 01:08:50,219
across with Pollyanna yeah um

1818
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,539
and that that's you know that's what you

1819
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:54,179
know they used to cross I thought it was

1820
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:55,500
the nl5 nl5 skunk one male I had it

1821
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:57,659
written down like that because I wasn't

1822
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,359
able to find exactly

1823
01:08:57,659 --> 01:09:02,099
what it is yeah but it's the same we

1824
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:03,199
have it's the same kind of strain base

1825
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:08,100
coming out

1826
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:10,379
yeah specifically it's the nl5 by by

1827
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,140
early Pearl skunk one

1828
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:15,900
you know so it's a three-way hybrid uh

1829
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,219
silver Pearl and what's interesting is

1830
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:19,379
since Matt and I have been kind of doing

1831
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:21,899
a deep dive on some of the Early Girl

1832
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,600
early Pearl stuff is you don't really

1833
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:26,278
realize it but secretly it was one of

1834
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,900
the most common things Neville used

1835
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:32,400
throughout his lines

1836
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:34,259
he loved it he loved that early Pearl he

1837
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,599
loved he loved mixing it into different

1838
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:38,579
stuff and so it's it doesn't really get

1839
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,900
talked about that much but it was one of

1840
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:41,818
his favorites

1841
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:44,119
and where did the early girl come from

1842
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:48,000
Northern California Northern California

1843
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:50,039
yeah and Pollyanna was huh we just

1844
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,439
recently found out

1845
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:54,238
um that one of them one of them I can't

1846
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:56,399
remember if it's early girl or Pollyanna

1847
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:58,439
I think it was Pollyanna

1848
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:01,139
maybe it was early girl one of them is

1849
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:04,259
not from Rob or Sam and I always thought

1850
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:05,820
both were from Rob Rob yeah no that's

1851
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,179
the there's a lot of assumptions so

1852
01:10:05,819 --> 01:10:10,920
early girl I believe is a is an Afghan

1853
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:13,079
Mexican

1854
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,880
and then they took that and they crossed

1855
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:17,760
that to Pollyanna which is an early

1856
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,800
Colombian by Mexican and that's early

1857
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,739
Pearl

1858
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:25,980
um and we also learned that that

1859
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:27,599
sweetness uh is very was very prevalent

1860
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:30,599
in the early Pearl and it was one of

1861
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,000
Neville's favorite things and he wanted

1862
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,360
to recreate it really badly later in his

1863
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,859
life because he

1864
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:41,099
really enjoyed sort of that double

1865
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:44,158
Mexican Afghan blend that was early

1866
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:46,020
Pearl and that's why it showed up in so

1867
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,658
many different hybrids he had

1868
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:51,060
and later in the night later in life he

1869
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:52,920
was working a specific oaxacan line I

1870
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:56,400
don't remember where he sourced it from

1871
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:58,260
specifically it was later but um he felt

1872
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:59,759
that that was very similar to what he

1873
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:02,579
saw in the early Pearl if I remember

1874
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,500
correctly and this is there's a there's

1875
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:07,559
a gentleman that that Matt and I chat

1876
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,800
with on IG

1877
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:14,159
um and he his family used to grow early

1878
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,380
Pearl in the 90s for about five years uh

1879
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:19,259
up in my neck of the woods and he's been

1880
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:22,980
kind of on the hunt to find he got lost

1881
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:24,659
in a bus sadly but he did say pip he he

1882
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:27,658
sent me not knowing that we're buddies

1883
01:11:24,658 --> 01:11:30,000
he sent me this pic you had posted a

1884
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:32,039
number of years ago of an early of a

1885
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,560
silver Pearl S1

1886
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:35,760
and he goes man does this look like my

1887
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:42,360
parents plant

1888
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:44,100
oh boy he did he did you know so uh take

1889
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:46,319
that for what it's worth but he go but

1890
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,880
there was uh yeah he showed me this

1891
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,340
picture and it's from you you know and

1892
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:54,239
he's like this one really looks like my

1893
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:56,579
parents old cut of early Pearl so who

1894
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,738
knows you know yeah you never know I

1895
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:00,479
mean it's it's it's it's pretty unique

1896
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:02,039
plant once you've been around it and

1897
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:03,599
you've seen some privacy you could kind

1898
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:05,819
of tell

1899
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,039
um you know what's related if it's

1900
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:10,198
related or not so I have no doubt that

1901
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:12,119
you know that's what he had and he

1902
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:13,799
thought that mine looked like his

1903
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:17,039
and it's also one of the rare things

1904
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:19,560
that pip doesn't take 84 days it doesn't

1905
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:21,300
take 84 days it's done before most of my

1906
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:24,780
plants are even halfway done flowering

1907
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:26,219
yeah it's so 50 55 or something like

1908
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:28,319
that it's like I mean you could pull it

1909
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:30,239
before 50 if you wanted to it's just uh

1910
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,619
it's it's so quick I feel like I throw

1911
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:33,658
it in the flower room and feed it for

1912
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:35,640
two weeks and then you know so it's like

1913
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:38,519
it's basically like a true seven weeker

1914
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,420
yeah oh man it's super quick yeah super

1915
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,520
quick

1916
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:43,619
I mean some of them go into the 50s you

1917
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:47,400
know 55 days or whatever but some of the

1918
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:49,979
progeny was done in 46 47 days you could

1919
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:52,139
probably pull it 45 if you lived in 1990

1920
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:53,819
like they always like yeah yeah you know

1921
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,679
you see these seed descriptions and

1922
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:57,960
flowering times and you're like oh it's

1923
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,260
done in you know 60 days and really

1924
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,340
Freedom 35 bro

1925
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:06,119
what was the flowering time on Super

1926
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:08,579
Skunk I remember being a kid 49 49 you

1927
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:10,559
know just getting started on indoor and

1928
01:13:08,579 --> 01:13:13,500
seeing those 50-day strains and being

1929
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,620
like I could get eight crops a year yeah

1930
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,619
yeah

1931
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:20,759
it was super enticing you know you're

1932
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:22,559
just thinking oh my gosh

1933
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,940
uh I didn't realize that it was a bit it

1934
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,800
was a bit of marketing back then

1935
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:27,419
claiming everything took six or seven

1936
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,100
weeks but

1937
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:31,079
um you know it was and then I realized

1938
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:33,179
how rare it was to find something that

1939
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:36,719
developed that quickly that I actually

1940
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:37,859
liked right so um so we got through uh

1941
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,579
the

1942
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:45,619
Ode to Neville let's get to q36

1943
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:48,179
oh boy excuse me

1944
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:49,859
q36 is a wild one

1945
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:54,420
um again I don't have an exact date but

1946
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:56,399
it's somewhere like 2010 11. ish 2009 to

1947
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:59,340
2011. somewhere in there I would

1948
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:01,019
probably put it uh so it's relatively

1949
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:04,079
kind of like new kid on the block out

1950
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:06,600
here uh for Ohio

1951
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,658
and it's uh when I first got it it was

1952
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,780
in like 28

1953
01:14:08,658 --> 01:14:13,679
2013 14. I don't know I'd have to look

1954
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:16,738
but

1955
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,420
it uh it when I first got that thing I

1956
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:19,678
couldn't believe it I was looking at the

1957
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,779
leaves on the thing it looked like it

1958
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,579
was like came out of the Jurassic period

1959
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:26,939
or something you know dinosaurs walking

1960
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:30,000
around so I mean super weird uh super

1961
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:32,879
dark Afghani like super unique Leaf

1962
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,520
shape and um so I've you know vegged it

1963
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,619
up and I flowered it out and it's

1964
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,780
definitely I could tell immediately it

1965
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:42,119
was definitely related to Bubba but it's

1966
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:44,219
not like anything that I've seen crossed

1967
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:46,198
with Bubba before I don't they say the

1968
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:48,359
lineage is it's basically Bubba Kush

1969
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:50,158
cross with Hawaiian indica and there was

1970
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:52,259
there was some work done

1971
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:55,500
um in that line they they had spread

1972
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:58,079
that line together a second time the f2s

1973
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,520
or the bx2s or whatever they did uh they

1974
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:00,840
had a plant called the nuke that went

1975
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,699
around for a while

1976
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,319
and it was decent

1977
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:06,238
um but eventually that kind of got

1978
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:10,019
thrown to the side once they used the

1979
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:11,099
nuke to make the Next Generation that

1980
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,980
you know

1981
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,360
the q36 came from ultimately yeah and

1982
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:16,738
that thing just blew everything out of

1983
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:18,839
the water so that nuke everybody kind of

1984
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:22,500
like threw that to the Wayside and just

1985
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:24,719
focused on the q36 so it's like a Bubba

1986
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,179
like a Bubba Kush but it's like cream

1987
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:29,100
like super creamy Bubba yeah it doesn't

1988
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:31,440
it doesn't have like typical Bubba

1989
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:36,239
leaves it's got these short little like

1990
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:37,919
like uh uh almost like uh like Clover or

1991
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:39,779
I don't know how to describe it they're

1992
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,520
they're very they're just very unique I

1993
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:43,259
have pictures on my Instagram page if

1994
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,020
you want to look

1995
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:48,239
um the the resident put it just pumps

1996
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:50,219
out resin it I mean almost looks like a

1997
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:52,019
like a like one of these hype strains

1998
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:54,539
that you see now it's just so Caked Up

1999
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,159
in resin yeah um the smaller plants

2000
01:15:54,539 --> 01:15:57,899
don't tend to yield too well but when I

2001
01:15:56,158 --> 01:15:59,399
put them in like three gallons or five

2002
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:01,920
gallons and got them nice and vegged up

2003
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:04,920
they do pretty good yielding it smells

2004
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,800
like creamy Bubba and anise like that uh

2005
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:10,500
again like a black licorice type like

2006
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:12,600
thing in there as well yeah and it's uh

2007
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:15,238
it's a low it's a low tester it tests at

2008
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,739
like 15 I think my buddies some people

2009
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:20,218
have had it tested a little bit higher

2010
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:22,979
but generally test below 20 but it is

2011
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:24,899
very just like Bubba very medical very

2012
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:27,899
good a good effect it's definitely

2013
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:30,599
smokes like it's over 20 percent uh the

2014
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:32,099
flavor is phenomenal like I said creamy

2015
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,020
Bubba

2016
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,940
um like if you're a Bubba lover like

2017
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:38,460
this one is the this is the ultimate

2018
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:39,599
it's like Primo Bubba yeah oh dude I

2019
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,819
mean it is

2020
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,340
pip has shared it in our little tight

2021
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:46,439
circle of friends and I would say almost

2022
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:48,600
universally

2023
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:51,779
um everyone regards it almost as an

2024
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,239
improved Bubba yeah you know like better

2025
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:56,639
maybe even maybe even better than Bubba

2026
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:57,839
would be a way to describe it like you

2027
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,360
know like everything they like about

2028
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:03,659
Bubba and more right that's exactly yeah

2029
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:05,519
that's how I would say and more

2030
01:17:03,658 --> 01:17:07,920
um

2031
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,179
Bubba kinda if you don't hit it right it

2032
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,340
doesn't really turn out well it doesn't

2033
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:12,960
yield well it's a little bit leafy and

2034
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:15,360
it can come out a little bit like soapy

2035
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,698
sometimes I feel like so

2036
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:19,319
uh this plant there's none of that you

2037
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:21,059
don't I mean even if you run it bad it's

2038
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:23,639
not coming out soapy it's not coming out

2039
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,140
crappy like it's still gonna do good so

2040
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,239
it's definitely like an improvement I

2041
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,699
mean I wouldn't call it above like above

2042
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:32,099
a cut right but it's uh it's definitely

2043
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:34,919
like a newer age version of like Bubba

2044
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:38,579
Kush that's the fire yeah uh improved

2045
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:40,020
improved version of the Bubba so

2046
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:41,579
the only reason why I say that is

2047
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,699
because most people that really love to

2048
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:46,738
grow Bubba for their head end up growing

2049
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:50,099
q36 for their head

2050
01:17:46,738 --> 01:17:52,259
and being totally happy with that plant

2051
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,699
and not having to grow Bubba for their

2052
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:56,340
head because they get everything they

2053
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:58,678
like about Bubba right and and a little

2054
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:01,260
bit more from it so it's just pretty

2055
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:03,060
High Praise really and just to clarify a

2056
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:06,119
lot of people get confused the uh the

2057
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:09,179
eludium is the q36 it's this it's the Q3

2058
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:11,279
eludium q36 space modulator it's the

2059
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:13,100
mark the gun or the Marvin the Martian

2060
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:15,479
used to use on the cartoon

2061
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:19,140
so that's the full name is you know

2062
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:22,019
eludium Q3 36 space modulator there you

2063
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:23,520
go there you go um and what was it um

2064
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,739
there was a weird breeding trait that I

2065
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,719
had where uh something about seed making

2066
01:18:25,738 --> 01:18:29,299
how it makes seeds yeah it doesn't make

2067
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:31,920
seeds I've tried to seed the thing

2068
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:35,100
numerous times and the same thing

2069
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:38,819
happens I get you know 20 maybe if I'm

2070
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:41,820
lucky 30 40 seeds out of each pound uh

2071
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:44,939
30 of them are premature fully like big

2072
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:46,679
seeds but just white and Hollow and um

2073
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:48,599
and then the other ones some are made

2074
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:50,279
mutated and then you sprout what you

2075
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,199
have left from that you know whatever 10

2076
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:55,500
or 12 seeds you get out of that

2077
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:59,339
15 maybe and you sprout them and then

2078
01:18:55,500 --> 01:19:01,380
summer are are

2079
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:04,260
like mutant like super mutant there's

2080
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:07,140
like maybe 25 30 of them from what I've

2081
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:10,320
seen yeah have been like mutant or runty

2082
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:13,020
or slow you know and then a small

2083
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:16,979
percentage of them though are

2084
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:19,620
are really nice I bet so it's been it's

2085
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:21,539
it's a lot it's a tough pill to swallow

2086
01:19:19,619 --> 01:19:23,819
when you try to pollinate a plant and

2087
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:26,219
you gotta rip apart a pound of weed to

2088
01:19:23,819 --> 01:19:28,139
get you know 10 or 15 seeds that you can

2089
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:30,060
grow and then only a quarter of those

2090
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,380
are going to be something decent and

2091
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:33,239
only a percentage of those are going to

2092
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:35,460
be something amazing yeah by the time

2093
01:19:33,238 --> 01:19:37,319
you were done slicing and dicing how

2094
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:40,319
much came out I was thinking to myself

2095
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:42,658
so it gets five seeds he likes I did

2096
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:47,340
cross it to the silver Pearl

2097
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:49,198
and I grew those seeds and I did find an

2098
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,300
awesome selection a really really

2099
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:53,219
awesome selection and it kind of made it

2100
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,640
worth it for me I posted it on my

2101
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:58,380
Instagram page it says it make seeds

2102
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:01,260
extremely resonance

2103
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:04,260
um yeah

2104
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:07,739
yeah it does so

2105
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:09,659
um it's extremely resinous uh maybe even

2106
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:11,459
more so than the q36 it's just

2107
01:20:09,658 --> 01:20:13,079
absolutely caked on there I'll get that

2108
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:14,698
picture over to you as well now yeah

2109
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:15,779
yeah

2110
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:18,119
um

2111
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:20,158
but I I made two selections they're both

2112
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:22,859
very nice one is just super unique it

2113
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:25,979
kind of has the uh I like that that like

2114
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:28,198
black licorice like like anise or I

2115
01:20:25,979 --> 01:20:30,899
don't know how you pronounce it but I

2116
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:34,198
like that and stuff and I like it in the

2117
01:20:30,899 --> 01:20:37,259
q36 and the the so one of the selections

2118
01:20:34,198 --> 01:20:39,238
I made has it's kind of like a lot of

2119
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:41,340
that and less of like the other aspects

2120
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:43,500
it's kind of like focused in onto it and

2121
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,360
it's not like the most ideal plant it's

2122
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,399
not a huge yield or it's kind of wiry

2123
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,259
but it's got good flower and it's got

2124
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:52,198
that flavor and that smell and that

2125
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:54,000
taste that I like so I keep it around

2126
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:57,059
I don't think a lot of people understand

2127
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,399
that too when it comes to reversals

2128
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:01,500
um is that uh because there's other

2129
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:03,479
things you've done too like with your

2130
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:06,600
East Coast Sour Diesel cut reversing it

2131
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:09,119
where like it works but it doesn't

2132
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:11,039
really give you enough seed that you can

2133
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:14,760
like even share it with friends it's

2134
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:17,158
almost like you it it gives you 15 or 30

2135
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,020
or 40 seeds or something so you can't

2136
01:21:17,158 --> 01:21:21,119
even make it happen yeah you can't make

2137
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:23,400
packs of it it's like even difficult to

2138
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:26,640
share with homies because you get so few

2139
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:28,319
and it took so much effort to do

2140
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,780
um so there's just certain varieties out

2141
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:34,259
there that for whatever reason don't

2142
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:36,960
don't reverse well or don't take seed

2143
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:40,400
don't take pollination well and it makes

2144
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,399
it really hard to make hybrids with them

2145
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,380
you know now speaking of hybrid making

2146
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:50,939
let's get into where you're at now where

2147
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:53,579
where you're at currently as of the time

2148
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:57,419
this podcast is gonna air

2149
01:21:53,579 --> 01:21:59,399
where I'm at in my seed making yeah

2150
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:02,399
uh well

2151
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:05,519
I am at a uh the point where I've

2152
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:07,379
already made the Rubber City and I did a

2153
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,940
rigorous selection process trying to

2154
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,760
narrow down what I feel like we're the

2155
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:13,678
best plants out of that run yeah and uh

2156
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,360
and I've grown them and cropped them and

2157
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,460
just done everything I could to really

2158
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:20,639
like make sure that what I want what I

2159
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:23,579
want to use and uh and then I have uh I

2160
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,140
I the one is the Ten the Rubber City

2161
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:27,658
number 10 and the other one is the River

2162
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:29,520
City number four but maybe before you go

2163
01:22:27,658 --> 01:22:32,279
any further just talk for a second about

2164
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,900
what made the Rubber City okay yeah yeah

2165
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:37,738
that sounds good and we'll go forward

2166
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:42,479
from there yeah the the Rubber City was

2167
01:22:37,738 --> 01:22:44,459
the uh Sour Diesel reversed onto the um

2168
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,678
Scentsy star at the time but the

2169
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:49,079
four-way yeah now

2170
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:52,399
and that's what uh what I created the

2171
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:52,399
original River City with

2172
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,560
so that's then you hunted that a bunch

2173
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,579
so I grew out probably

2174
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,500
um

2175
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:03,779
right around 50 seeds I can't remember

2176
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,640
the exact number I grew out about 50

2177
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:07,319
seeds of it and these are all females

2178
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,079
that you're growing female all females

2179
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:13,380
yeah all females so big and they are

2180
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:15,059
they it was just absolutely beautiful I

2181
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:16,619
couldn't have I couldn't have asked for

2182
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:19,679
a better results

2183
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:22,079
um I ended up cloning about half the Run

2184
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:25,079
uh for backups just because everything

2185
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:27,000
was looking so good uh halfway through I

2186
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:28,800
usually take my clones off the flowering

2187
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,840
plants you know a small Branch or

2188
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,340
something like that just so that they

2189
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,260
aren't constantly growing they're just

2190
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:36,900
re-veging in a stasis mode for a while

2191
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:39,060
until everything's finished yeah

2192
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:41,460
um when you keep a lot of moms you kind

2193
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:43,860
of have to right you have to figure out

2194
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:45,719
these little tactics to oh yeah have

2195
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:47,579
things outgrow each other and keep

2196
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:51,300
things in a stasis while being healthy

2197
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:53,640
at the same time yeah right so I um so I

2198
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:55,199
I definitely selected about half of them

2199
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,420
and then I did another run immediately

2200
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,279
after the sea drone was done just to

2201
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:01,859
double check because uh some people may

2202
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,658
not notice this but uh seed plants seed

2203
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:06,420
plants versus clone plants of the same

2204
01:24:03,658 --> 01:24:09,539
exact copy of the genetic is can

2205
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:11,399
drastically differ oh yeah you know yeah

2206
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:13,439
um I mean maybe not drastically but they

2207
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:15,899
can differ they're good amount you know

2208
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,479
like uh seed plants usually tend to be

2209
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:19,979
more vigorous and yield more and you

2210
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:23,099
know do you guys agree with that oh yeah

2211
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:24,479
and Hermes right right yeah right they

2212
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,940
got yeah

2213
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,738
uh so I grew out a bunch of those I made

2214
01:24:26,939 --> 01:24:32,639
selections of half of them and then I

2215
01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:34,379
did about uh probably four maybe five

2216
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,840
rounds over the course of like a year

2217
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:38,880
and a half of narrowing it down I would

2218
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,039
just grow you know each grow I would

2219
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:44,760
narrow it down from like you know half

2220
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:46,260
of them to 20 to 15 to 10. and like once

2221
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,520
I got to like I remember getting to like

2222
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,640
eight of them that I had to choose

2223
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,320
between it was just like I they were all

2224
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,659
so good that they all would have been

2225
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,698
good you know I had to like nitpick like

2226
01:24:54,658 --> 01:24:58,619
this one this one structures a little

2227
01:24:56,698 --> 01:25:00,779
bit floppier than this one but they're

2228
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:03,300
all still still fire you know yeah it's

2229
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:05,759
super good so I just kind of splitting

2230
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:08,400
hairs there you go yep I was splitting

2231
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,719
hairs so uh but eventually I had uh I

2232
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:12,299
had narrowed it down after several

2233
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:13,800
different runs to uh the Rubber City

2234
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,960
number 10 and the Rubber City number

2235
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,880
four go figure I would find two of my

2236
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,060
best selections in the first 10 seats

2237
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:24,480
huh yeah right right out of the first I

2238
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:27,060
bought 15 and the number 20 was banging

2239
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:32,059
so everybody knows he resisted the urge

2240
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:35,159
to name it Rubber City 189. he did yeah

2241
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:38,340
his effort to make it seem like that you

2242
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:40,079
know so uh problems on that one yeah I

2243
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:42,119
mean it is what it is I mean I'm not

2244
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,738
concerned with the numbers you know I

2245
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:46,260
post pictures people know what I do

2246
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:47,399
people know what I run like and we

2247
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:48,900
actually I remember when you were doing

2248
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:51,119
those selections and like the first

2249
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:52,559
round you're like oh my God guys I don't

2250
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:55,500
even know how I'm gonna cut through

2251
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:58,020
these let alone pick one or two you know

2252
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:59,939
yeah I remember I mean the other part of

2253
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:01,739
it that was funny too was he would pip

2254
01:25:59,939 --> 01:26:04,738
would call me and be like so I smoked

2255
01:26:01,738 --> 01:26:06,658
two or three examples and I'm now ruined

2256
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:09,299
and I don't think I can judge anymore

2257
01:26:06,658 --> 01:26:11,939
for a while because I'm already so baked

2258
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:15,060
I kind of have to chill out before I can

2259
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:17,039
try anymore yeah you know because that's

2260
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:19,620
what happens too like testing a large

2261
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:21,600
number of things sometimes it's like you

2262
01:26:19,619 --> 01:26:24,000
can only test two or three a day you

2263
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,500
know because you wake up and you try a

2264
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,738
few and then all of a sudden your days

2265
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:30,479
changed yeah

2266
01:26:28,738 --> 01:26:33,419
yeah it's hard to keep a fresh palette

2267
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:35,459
and a fresh head you know

2268
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:37,199
it's a slow process to do it the right

2269
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:39,899
way you got to do it over the course of

2270
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:42,359
days weeks you know months if you got

2271
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:43,799
enough stuff I guess right so I'll say

2272
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:45,179
one thing and then I'll shut up and let

2273
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,520
pip talk but one of the things I think

2274
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:50,639
that's cool that not very many people

2275
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,980
out here in breeding do anymore

2276
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:55,679
um but we have some friends that do is

2277
01:26:52,979 --> 01:26:58,138
that they make a hybrid like Rubber City

2278
01:26:55,679 --> 01:27:00,899
and then they hunt the hybrid and then

2279
01:26:58,139 --> 01:27:02,880
they select uh favorites from that and

2280
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:05,339
then they do further work

2281
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:08,219
right a lot of breeding today is sort of

2282
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:09,900
one step one-off one and done you make

2283
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:11,340
it you release it it's there till it's

2284
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:14,219
gone

2285
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:16,739
um and you know uh what we're about to

2286
01:27:14,219 --> 01:27:18,960
talk about right now is PIP you know he

2287
01:27:16,738 --> 01:27:22,019
made his some of his favorite selections

2288
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,399
and then he he you know he used those to

2289
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,739
make more things

2290
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:28,619
so let's start off with

2291
01:27:25,738 --> 01:27:31,738
um rubber band

2292
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:33,899
the rubber band yeah okay rubber band is

2293
01:27:31,738 --> 01:27:35,698
the Rubber City number 10. so all this

2294
01:27:33,899 --> 01:27:38,399
stuff on the on the Rubber City drop is

2295
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:40,500
my Rubber City 10 selection uh that I

2296
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:44,158
reversed uh so that would be the Rubber

2297
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:47,279
City 10 cross to uh triangle Kush okay

2298
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:48,899
so I did that I named it rubber band as

2299
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:50,279
it's supposed to be said all is one word

2300
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:52,198
kind of like headband rubber band

2301
01:27:50,279 --> 01:27:54,779
headband that's kind of my take on it

2302
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:56,879
you know um Sour Diesel OG Kush the

2303
01:27:54,779 --> 01:27:58,920
Rubber City 10 is a is definitely more

2304
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,119
of a sour diesel leaning looking type of

2305
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,739
plant

2306
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:03,899
um even though I consider it

2307
01:28:01,738 --> 01:28:06,419
multiple times better than Sour Diesel

2308
01:28:03,899 --> 01:28:08,759
I'll smoke it over Sour Diesel any day

2309
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:10,380
of the week yeah oh yeah

2310
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,719
yeah

2311
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:14,639
um so that's that's what the that's what

2312
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:17,880
the rubber band is

2313
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,859
um I did a uh I did a couple other ones

2314
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,020
um I did the the through chemd in there

2315
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:24,599
everybody loves the chemd and it's

2316
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:27,920
already got those those funky dirty like

2317
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:30,960
you know yeah really really gassy and

2318
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,219
skunky type of like smells to it so I

2319
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,899
figured that would be a good one to

2320
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:36,000
throw against it and and just produce

2321
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:38,039
some nice yielders and that's called

2322
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,658
Dirty Rubber and that's going to be your

2323
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:42,899
that's going to be the dirty rubber yep

2324
01:28:39,658 --> 01:28:47,239
I like that name great name yep

2325
01:28:42,899 --> 01:28:47,239
[Laughter]

2326
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:53,519
yeah and um we have the the star dog you

2327
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:55,979
use the Corey Haim cut for better than

2328
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,440
rubber I did yeah um like I said in the

2329
01:28:55,979 --> 01:29:00,359
description it the I've always liked the

2330
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:02,879
star dog that star dog cut it's a high

2331
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:04,859
yielder uh I pulled off some nice runs

2332
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,719
with it before it makes big flowers uh

2333
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:09,179
super gassy

2334
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,500
um you know JJ did some good work with

2335
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:12,239
really good work with that line I

2336
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:14,460
enjoyed that plant it's a great Cropper

2337
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,839
and it's still got gas and uh and it

2338
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:17,579
shares a lot of similar traits with my

2339
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,980
Rubber City 10s you know they're not the

2340
01:29:17,579 --> 01:29:22,380
same plant by any means uh but they both

2341
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:25,319
are very vigorous growing big they're

2342
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:27,840
that commercial style growth structure

2343
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:30,960
and stretch and Bud that you want you

2344
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,699
know like the colas and uh so I just I

2345
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,399
figured you know it'd be fun to cross

2346
01:29:32,698 --> 01:29:36,839
them together and uh and and see what

2347
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:39,238
kind of craziness comes out of those

2348
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,100
things you know yeah and I see you have

2349
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:43,379
um some Rubber City back cross one and

2350
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:45,120
Rubber City back cross yeah let's talk

2351
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:48,060
about those yeah two different versions

2352
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:52,079
of the back crosses I uh I crossed the

2353
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:54,480
uh sour back or the Rubber City 10 to

2354
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:56,698
the uh sour and I also crossed it to the

2355
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:58,079
four-way so you kind of have a choice

2356
01:29:56,698 --> 01:29:59,519
you can kind of pick something that

2357
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:00,719
you're gonna want to want to see a

2358
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,040
little bit more four-way or you're gonna

2359
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,658
see you want something that you're gonna

2360
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:06,600
see a little bit more

2361
01:30:03,658 --> 01:30:08,698
um uh sour you know yeah the Gold Coast

2362
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:10,920
hash plant all right Gold Coast hash

2363
01:30:08,698 --> 01:30:12,259
plant let's go yeah so the Gold Coast

2364
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:16,500
hash plant

2365
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:18,780
uh is my Rubber City 10 selection across

2366
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:21,000
to death Coast sister so some of you

2367
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:23,579
people are familiar with my death Coast

2368
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,859
it makes a lot of really good extracts

2369
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:27,619
uh especially solventless it's popular

2370
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:30,539
artists popular

2371
01:30:27,619 --> 01:30:33,840
it's really it's it's really the loudest

2372
01:30:30,539 --> 01:30:36,359
[ __ ] I've ever had and there's it

2373
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,520
produces Bunches of it so I run it over

2374
01:30:36,359 --> 01:30:40,198
my t-shirt screens and save jars of it

2375
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:43,199
and send it to friends for a while

2376
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:45,299
Factor yeah and so that their wives can

2377
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:48,059
scream at them and why the house house

2378
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:51,420
smells like a skunk yep yep

2379
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:53,760
that's for real that's just for Real uh

2380
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:57,060
so uh yeah but anyway the the death

2381
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:00,480
Coast was um out of the um the the BC

2382
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:02,840
one generation I did I crossed um

2383
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:06,658
uh Sour Diesel and death star

2384
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:08,219
and made a selection and uh that was the

2385
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:09,479
popular one at the time but a lot of

2386
01:31:08,219 --> 01:31:12,179
people don't know that I made a

2387
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:14,399
secondary selection as well uh which was

2388
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:16,380
definitely a more sour type of uh

2389
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:19,319
looking plant

2390
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:20,340
um and uh you know I enjoyed it it was a

2391
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:21,960
little bit different than death coast

2392
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:24,659
and I've been smoking it for a long time

2393
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,158
and uh eventually I started um I was

2394
01:31:24,658 --> 01:31:27,779
making death Coast hash and I said oh

2395
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:30,479
I'll make hash with the death Coast

2396
01:31:27,779 --> 01:31:32,340
sister too this time and see how it does

2397
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:33,658
because every time I break it up you

2398
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:36,420
know something's hashy when you break it

2399
01:31:33,658 --> 01:31:38,158
up for a joint and you see you can just

2400
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:40,079
see it all fall onto the table you've

2401
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:41,819
moved it yeah you move the pile of weed

2402
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,420
a little bit and there's there's a line

2403
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:47,939
of hash left you know yeah

2404
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:50,399
just dumps so uh and I've always liked

2405
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:52,619
the plant so anyway it just you know I

2406
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:55,259
broke that thing up and it was it was

2407
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:58,079
dumping big time Big Big Time and I was

2408
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:59,579
just I just the smoke was phenomenal I

2409
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:01,738
was like I gotta do something with this

2410
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:04,979
thing this is this is too good

2411
01:32:01,738 --> 01:32:06,718
so I cross it to my River City 10 and uh

2412
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:08,099
when it was seated up

2413
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:10,439
um breaking it up when it was even

2414
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:12,600
because seated plants are you know

2415
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:14,819
notoriously thought to not produce as

2416
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,719
much resin right

2417
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:18,658
um

2418
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:20,399
you there yeah yeah okay yeah seated

2419
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:22,738
plants are thought to not really produce

2420
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:25,738
as much resin right well this thing

2421
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:28,138
dumped just as good if not better

2422
01:32:25,738 --> 01:32:30,059
seated yeah because it does unseated and

2423
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:32,039
it just I've got the pictures on my Ig

2424
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:34,100
you can see the gloves it's just after

2425
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:36,119
every couple ounces two three ounces

2426
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,860
breaking it up with your hands the

2427
01:32:36,119 --> 01:32:39,479
gloves are just so caked that they're

2428
01:32:37,859 --> 01:32:41,460
falling apart and ripping like you have

2429
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:43,500
to switch your gloves and

2430
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,539
it's pretty wild it's pretty wild

2431
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:47,219
stuffed I mean is that what is the death

2432
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:51,719
Coast sister is that what we would call

2433
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:53,819
like internally the SD uh bx7 yes yes

2434
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:55,739
that's Yeah in our group that's the

2435
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:59,039
first the first name on the label the

2436
01:32:55,738 --> 01:33:01,439
sour diesel DX number seven plant yeah

2437
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:03,539
yeah not not bx7 but yeah it's number

2438
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:06,059
seven yeah yeah yes yes

2439
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:09,600
yep uh so I've had that one for a while

2440
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:12,900
it's you know probably my pride enjoys

2441
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,219
um I only I I the flower is nice a lot

2442
01:33:12,899 --> 01:33:16,198
of people request the flower I

2443
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:19,260
personally prefer to smoke the hash over

2444
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:22,919
the flour same with the death Coast

2445
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:24,719
um they're like it's just it just the

2446
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,359
flower is good but I love I love my hash

2447
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,920
and when I got a plant that dumps like

2448
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:30,238
this you know that's what yeah that's

2449
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:33,420
what I'm using it for and that's kind of

2450
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:36,119
what I created it for is for uh to to be

2451
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:38,520
like a hash plant you know I'm shocked

2452
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:39,899
that this I I don't know why I mean

2453
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,460
because you're you're this is one of the

2454
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:43,738
cuts you were real open with about

2455
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:46,800
sharing yeah I don't know why that this

2456
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:48,299
didn't hit the like boom past the hype

2457
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,320
market and just shoot to the top because

2458
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:54,779
it jumps like uh for resin production

2459
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:57,299
extracts how loud it is like some people

2460
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:59,698
will smell this as a straight up skunk I

2461
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:02,699
think so people like I smell more burnt

2462
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:03,779
rubber with that back end but to a lot

2463
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:05,099
of people this is going to be one of the

2464
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:08,039
skunkiest things they've ever smelled

2465
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:09,840
and actually I think the skunk comes out

2466
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:12,179
stronger in the hash

2467
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,500
definitely yeah that's for sure you know

2468
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:16,619
and I think that happens with the

2469
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:19,979
numbers Amplified yeah uh the skunkiness

2470
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:22,500
is Amplified in hashish yeah it really

2471
01:34:19,979 --> 01:34:26,279
it really is it's uh

2472
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:29,158
I love my hash man yeah I'm making cash

2473
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:31,198
too uh what else we got let's see uh

2474
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:34,379
talk about the

2475
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:37,079
um premium rubber yes premium rubber is

2476
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:39,000
one of my pride and joy Creations uh

2477
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:40,380
that is both of my Rubber City

2478
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,960
selections

2479
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:43,980
crossed together

2480
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,319
um

2481
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:48,539
you still there yeah okay so that's

2482
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:50,880
where so the four and the ten yeah the

2483
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:52,500
four and the ten uh cross together and

2484
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,960
those are my two favorite plants that's

2485
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,819
all I smoke really uh I I you know I

2486
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,739
smoke silver Pearl I smoke I throw a mix

2487
01:34:56,819 --> 01:35:00,479
other stuff in but my daily smoke for

2488
01:34:58,738 --> 01:35:03,539
the past

2489
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:05,218
four years has been pretty much the

2490
01:35:03,539 --> 01:35:08,579
Rubber City 10 or the River City four

2491
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:10,439
the Rubber City number 10 is more of a

2492
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:12,960
high yield like higher yielder than the

2493
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:14,399
four like as far as like bigger buds I

2494
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,500
shouldn't say I mean slightly higher

2495
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:18,539
higher yielder but it's bigger buds it's

2496
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:20,520
more along the sour side of the spectrum

2497
01:35:18,539 --> 01:35:21,960
but it's still got all the gas and skunk

2498
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:24,900
and onion and rubber it's got all that

2499
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:26,219
stuff in it but um and it's like the

2500
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:28,079
high yield or so it's kind of like the

2501
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:29,819
All-Star so I look at that as like my

2502
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:31,139
commercial the commercial All-Star and

2503
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:33,238
then I have the number four which is

2504
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:35,279
like my head stash All-Star even though

2505
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:37,079
I smoke I'm both the same but the the

2506
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:41,698
head stash one is a little bit less sour

2507
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:43,979
diesel more like uh uh it's got the sour

2508
01:35:41,698 --> 01:35:45,658
diesel it's got all the gassiness all

2509
01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:48,178
the skunkiness all the everything but

2510
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:51,599
it's got a lot of uh Aromas and potency

2511
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:55,619
from um the four-way cut

2512
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:58,440
so it's got It's very very hashy like it

2513
01:35:55,619 --> 01:36:00,179
burns um it when you take a hit off a

2514
01:35:58,439 --> 01:36:02,039
bowl and you set the bowl down that bowl

2515
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:03,420
just keeps burning a little trail of

2516
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:05,760
smoke off of it like when you're smoking

2517
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:08,279
hash out of a bowl right yeah uh but

2518
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:10,739
with just the weed it like that's you

2519
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:13,380
know and it tastes like hash and it is

2520
01:36:10,738 --> 01:36:14,638
just one of the most potent plants I put

2521
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:17,400
it right there next to the Death Star

2522
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:20,819
you know it's it's it's just uh you know

2523
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:22,920
it might surpass it I I I really it's so

2524
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:24,960
I don't know man it's my favorite plant

2525
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:26,520
that that I've ever made and I've ever

2526
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:30,239
selected and I'll probably have it with

2527
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,880
me till I go to my grave yeah yeah I'm

2528
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:34,738
still partial to the Pearl but this

2529
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:37,199
stuff for people looking for like those

2530
01:36:34,738 --> 01:36:38,879
volatile sulfur compounds right this is

2531
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:40,919
such a special plant

2532
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,480
such a special plant but don't forget

2533
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,739
about his pearles ones that he's got

2534
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:46,259
because those are pretty pretty

2535
01:36:43,738 --> 01:36:48,779
phenomenal too so I have no doubt uh

2536
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:51,239
people are gonna find some extremely

2537
01:36:48,779 --> 01:36:53,359
nice plants and uh not all of this of

2538
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:57,119
course but especially the premium rubber

2539
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:59,759
uh with that four being crossed in there

2540
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:02,039
um you know the sky's the limit I mean

2541
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,500
there could be some some serious

2542
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:08,158
unicorns pulled out of that thing yeah I

2543
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:10,020
think uh and um so that's kind of one

2544
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:11,698
that I that I really I really take a lot

2545
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,199
of pride in I like that one and then I

2546
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:15,359
have the the last one would be the

2547
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:18,000
Goodyear which is the Rubber City number

2548
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:21,599
10 s ones as well

2549
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,639
uh cross to cross to itself and um and

2550
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,980
those will be those will be extremely

2551
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:28,500
high yielding they will be more along

2552
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:31,019
the lines of sour but a lot of them are

2553
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:33,060
more uh the Rubber City 10 is more it's

2554
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:34,860
more dense than this hour but it's not

2555
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:38,639
like dense like Indica dense it's just

2556
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:40,679
yeah not as Loose as like sour is and um

2557
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,859
and it's easier to grow sour is a

2558
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:45,359
finicky plant uh definitely I mean you

2559
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:48,119
can grow it and get it to come out okay

2560
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:50,339
but to get it to come out 110 like you

2561
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:52,920
really got it you know it's really easy

2562
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:55,860
it's really easy to make Buffy sour too

2563
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:57,779
oh yeah oh yeah I've seen a lot of bad

2564
01:37:55,859 --> 01:38:00,299
sour that that was actually sour but

2565
01:37:57,779 --> 01:38:01,979
just bad it's easy to screw it up I'm

2566
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,900
guilty I've done it before you know

2567
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:06,178
definitely have myself

2568
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:07,319
um but it's just sour is just such a

2569
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:09,658
tough plant and that's kind of one of

2570
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:12,539
the reasons I wanted to do this uh is

2571
01:38:09,658 --> 01:38:15,839
just because it's these plants are I

2572
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:17,579
feel like better than sour and and they

2573
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,619
are easier to grow than sour they're not

2574
01:38:17,579 --> 01:38:22,079
as finicky and sensitive and all that

2575
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:23,760
kinds of stuff and yeah I feel like you

2576
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:25,260
know people say clones lose Vigor over

2577
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:28,440
the years and stuff like that I didn't

2578
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:31,920
have sour diesel in the 90s so I don't

2579
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:33,719
know what it was like back then but uh

2580
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,699
today it's still a nice plant and

2581
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:38,219
vigorous and it makes a good yield but

2582
01:38:35,698 --> 01:38:40,799
it's got nothing on the on the River

2583
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:42,060
City tent like it's just this the

2584
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,039
rubbers like we were talking about how

2585
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:46,020
eludium is like the new Bubba like this

2586
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:48,238
the Rubber City number 10 is basically

2587
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:51,420
like how I look at it it's the new

2588
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:52,738
upgraded version of Sour Diesel I know

2589
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:55,020
the guys in our group are running it

2590
01:38:52,738 --> 01:38:57,000
like that too oh yeah they're using it

2591
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:59,280
and working it into lines is their new

2592
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,859
sour of bitter and cry baby and those

2593
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:04,079
guys yeah one thing maybe that I thought

2594
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:06,139
we should we could mention real quick uh

2595
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:10,380
before we run out of time here is that

2596
01:39:06,139 --> 01:39:12,119
the when Pip was just talking about uh

2597
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:13,980
you know some of these hybrids he

2598
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:15,899
actually did something that I think is

2599
01:39:13,979 --> 01:39:19,500
really cool and it's kind of it's

2600
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:21,658
actually super rare which is most times

2601
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:24,060
when people make feminized hybrids

2602
01:39:21,658 --> 01:39:27,000
they're either outcrossing it to a

2603
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:29,460
totally different line or they are s

2604
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:33,179
wanting it and one of the rarest things

2605
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:35,100
is to make feminized seed from two

2606
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:38,279
different examples from the same line

2607
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:41,579
yeah right so making something like the

2608
01:39:38,279 --> 01:39:43,380
rc10 by the rc4 is actually something

2609
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:45,899
that's super rare it's actually a

2610
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:48,600
feminized Rubber City Line

2611
01:39:45,899 --> 01:39:50,339
right yeah it's for it's further work

2612
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,500
and it's one of the rarest things that

2613
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:55,139
you'll see on the market because almost

2614
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:58,260
all feminized reversals like I said are

2615
01:39:55,139 --> 01:39:59,279
either s1s or outcrosses to something

2616
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:01,860
different

2617
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:05,460
it not Line work there's very little

2618
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:08,219
feminized Line work in a way so I don't

2619
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:11,639
know exactly know what you'd call rc10

2620
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:13,739
by rc4 like how you do exactly f1r

2621
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:19,020
you know that's how we call it

2622
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:21,059
what f1r F1 reversal just F2

2623
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:22,920
yeah I mean it can't it's the second

2624
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:25,260
generation of Representative yeah I mean

2625
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:28,500
it's a it's a reversal it's in the same

2626
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:29,639
line so it's it's in Crossing it in a

2627
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:31,920
sense too

2628
01:40:29,639 --> 01:40:34,920
it's just it's a pure Rubber City Line

2629
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:38,158
F1 it's not it's not an F1 right it

2630
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:40,319
would be an F2 yeah because it is

2631
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:41,939
totally different clone yeah f2r yeah

2632
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:45,238
you're right but I just wanted to point

2633
01:40:41,939 --> 01:40:47,219
out that in in in feminized seed it's

2634
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:49,198
that that line is one of the rarest

2635
01:40:47,219 --> 01:40:52,260
things which it's Line work but made

2636
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:56,039
femini style it's not an outcross and

2637
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:58,320
it's not uh an S1 it's not inbred it's

2638
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:59,639
you know it's uh two full sisters

2639
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:01,619
crossed to each other which doesn't

2640
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:03,480
happen that often yeah I've seen it

2641
01:41:01,619 --> 01:41:04,859
happen quite a bit lately I think people

2642
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:06,419
are finally starting to catch on to

2643
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:08,880
stuff like that

2644
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:12,239
um and if if my theory is correct about

2645
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:15,779
uh the super skunk trait the Afghan tea

2646
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:19,019
trait being a a what is it double

2647
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:21,658
recessive then every time you

2648
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:24,120
cross to the Afghan T types together

2649
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:26,460
you're reinforcing that trait and you're

2650
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:28,079
getting those volatile sulfur compounds

2651
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:30,300
like just stacking and stacking that's

2652
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:32,639
what I think is going on and like this

2653
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:34,679
is that ultimate example of that I mean

2654
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,779
if you want some of its parents or some

2655
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:38,579
of it's some of its rarer stuff that

2656
01:41:36,779 --> 01:41:39,899
could be in the line to pop up that

2657
01:41:38,579 --> 01:41:43,079
would probably be the line to look

2658
01:41:39,899 --> 01:41:45,539
through yeah oh yeah then like I said

2659
01:41:43,079 --> 01:41:47,279
man there is going to be I mean I

2660
01:41:45,539 --> 01:41:49,679
haven't done a ton of that line yet I've

2661
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:51,179
just done small populations but the uh

2662
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:53,899
you know eventually I would like to

2663
01:41:51,179 --> 01:41:56,639
throw down a couple hundred seeds of of

2664
01:41:53,899 --> 01:41:59,519
Premium Rubber and the Goodyear and uh

2665
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:00,840
even some of the the BC work you know

2666
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,460
yeah

2667
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:04,920
um and just really go through them like

2668
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:06,899
the right way unfortunately like I in my

2669
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:08,460
position you know up until this point

2670
01:42:06,899 --> 01:42:10,738
I've only been able to test like 50

2671
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:12,719
plants around 50 plants of each line

2672
01:42:10,738 --> 01:42:14,339
that I make yeah and you know that's

2673
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,219
done me pretty good that's given me some

2674
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:19,319
really nice selections uh oh yeah

2675
01:42:16,219 --> 01:42:20,639
surprisingly uh you know I really really

2676
01:42:19,319 --> 01:42:21,840
didn't think it was at first when I

2677
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:23,340
first started all this I didn't think it

2678
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,800
was going to be that easy I figured I'd

2679
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:28,800
have to look through a thousand seeds to

2680
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:30,960
to find that one you know and sometimes

2681
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,300
you do I feel like you know you probably

2682
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:36,779
do but if you're popping Haze maybe

2683
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:38,400
right so I had to troll time I mean

2684
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:40,319
sometimes you get lucky and you find it

2685
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:42,599
in five sometimes you find it in fifty

2686
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:44,460
sometimes it takes multiple rounds

2687
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:47,159
because you can find exactly what you

2688
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:49,198
were hunting for so it just is you know

2689
01:42:47,158 --> 01:42:52,138
it's it's a love it's a roll the dice

2690
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:53,579
and a law of averages yeah 50 has been

2691
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:55,920
good for me like I said I have found

2692
01:42:53,579 --> 01:42:59,279
some amazing seeds and our amazing

2693
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:01,560
plants and and 50 seed populations

2694
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:03,420
um you know uh you know you do 50 seeds

2695
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,880
of Premium rubber or the Goodyear or

2696
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,960
something like that and I mean we're

2697
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,520
talking you're going to be seeing

2698
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,319
everything those lines have to offer

2699
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,820
that's I mean you're going to find

2700
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:13,500
you're going to find some really really

2701
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:15,658
really nice stuff you don't need to pop

2702
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:17,520
100 seeds you don't even really need to

2703
01:43:15,658 --> 01:43:19,559
pop 50 you know like you just you know

2704
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,480
get a few packs and that's another thing

2705
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:24,719
I'd suggest if anybody's interested in

2706
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:27,118
like figure out what line you want and

2707
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,579
um and buy multiple packs

2708
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,679
yeah

2709
01:43:28,579 --> 01:43:33,118
that's a mistake I made early on in my

2710
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:35,460
in breeding

2711
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:37,799
is uh I would go to Amsterdam and I

2712
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:40,319
would buy like 20 different things

2713
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:42,119
instead of buying a bunch of packs of a

2714
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:43,500
few different things yeah and having

2715
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:45,059
more to look through because I got

2716
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:47,520
excited

2717
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:50,820
um so sometimes having more seeds of one

2718
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:53,639
line is better than having you know one

2719
01:43:50,819 --> 01:43:55,319
pack of eight different things also from

2720
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:57,480
a Breeder's perspective when I get

2721
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:59,219
orders in and since I'm the one filling

2722
01:43:57,479 --> 01:44:01,919
orders and I think you know Pip's going

2723
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:04,500
to be too when we see someone old order

2724
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,899
multiple packs of one line

2725
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:08,698
like 99 of the time I'm going to hook

2726
01:44:06,899 --> 01:44:10,259
them up with like multiple packs of

2727
01:44:08,698 --> 01:44:11,759
other lines too because I know they're

2728
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:13,619
doing serious stuff I know they're being

2729
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,060
serious about what they're doing so I'm

2730
01:44:13,618 --> 01:44:16,979
more likely to do stuff like that even

2731
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:19,020
but every step and you know surprisingly

2732
01:44:16,979 --> 01:44:21,238
it's it's kind of rare not very many

2733
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:22,500
people do that would you agree yeah no

2734
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:24,959
it is

2735
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,520
huh yeah it's definitely that rare and

2736
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,960
that's why when I see it I'm like yes

2737
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,280
I'm gonna hook this dude up they're

2738
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,779
serious yeah people know what they're

2739
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:32,340
doing people are on a mission they know

2740
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:34,019
the strain they want they know they want

2741
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:36,360
to find the one so they drop the money

2742
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:38,100
on it they make the investment and you

2743
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:39,539
know it doesn't matter what it costs as

2744
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:41,699
long as you get the plant that plant you

2745
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:43,560
can make the sky's the limit whatever

2746
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:44,638
however much money you want because you

2747
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,139
have that plant for the rest of your

2748
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:47,639
life you know it doesn't matter if that

2749
01:44:46,139 --> 01:44:50,699
seed costs twenty dollars or thirty

2750
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:52,440
dollars whatever you know hell that the

2751
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:54,599
plan will pay itself back when you grow

2752
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:57,000
it from seed

2753
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:58,679
and then you have it forever so

2754
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,679
it's always nice to find that special

2755
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:03,420
one so anyway if you if you're gonna if

2756
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,340
you're looking at the menu you know just

2757
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:08,158
uh just pick a line or two or whatever

2758
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:09,840
that you're interested in and uh and get

2759
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:10,738
a few packs of it you know two-pack I

2760

mean you're gonna you're gonna be happy

2761
01:45:10,738 --> 01:45:14,579
with all the plants obviously but it's a

2762
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:17,759
lottery it's a numbers game when you

2763
01:45:14,579 --> 01:45:19,500
grow seeds as everybody knows um like I

2764
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,820

2765
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,279
number four they were in the first ten

2766

seeds of uh of a larger progeny you know

2767
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:28,439
yeah it's just the roll of the dice

2768
01:45:25,139 --> 01:45:29,940
sometimes uh but um but you're going to

2769
01:45:28,439 --> 01:45:31,379
be happy I mean you're going to be happy

2770
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:32,759

always some better than others

2774
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:40,500
um but like I said it's just a numbers

2775
01:45:37,618 --> 01:45:42,179
game grab you know two three packs uh

2776
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,920

2777
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:46,618
most people if you're like extremely

2778
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,118

that Matt and I did uh one of the one of

2866
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:09,840
the main reasons why we did this podcast

2867
01:49:07,439 --> 01:49:12,779
was to give people a chance to listen to

2868
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:15,300
How like we nerds like like to chit chat

01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:38,158
um and I think that like the way he

2879
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:41,399
breeds is pretty neat because he doesn't

2880
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:43,079
really do any hype stuff too much he

2881
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:44,819
kind of like if you listen to this

2882
01:49:43,079 --> 01:49:47,340
podcast he kind of like collected

2883
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:49,319
strains over the years and he picked

2884
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:51,659
favorites and then he decided what

2885
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:54,420
happens if I mix these favorites

2886
01:49:51,658 --> 01:49:56,158
and that is sort of like the basis for

2887
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:59,520
what he's been doing so it's a very

2888
01:49:56,158 --> 01:50:01,799
personal approach in my opinion

2889
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,540
um he bred things he liked which is

2890
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:06,060
something I always tell people to do

2891
01:50:03,539 --> 01:50:07,319
pick things you like and try to find

2892
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:09,300
things you like

2893
01:50:07,319 --> 01:50:10,679
you know and don't care about what the

2894
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,900
rest of the world thinks find things

2895
01:50:10,679 --> 01:50:15,359
that you think are interesting and I

2896
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:17,579
think that this list uh definitely

2897
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:20,039
represents that in a big way

2898
01:50:17,579 --> 01:50:21,658
yeah that's a big positive and it

2899
01:50:20,039 --> 01:50:23,460
doesn't matter if your family gets upset

2900
01:50:21,658 --> 01:50:25,559
that you hang out at rest stops and with

2901
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:26,770
that this will be the end of the show

2902
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:29,889
thanks

all of a sudden I just started

01:50:40,859 --> 01:50:45,500
questioning everything I'd ever been

told

01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:53,360
you know by the time by the time I got

2910
01:50:49,618 --> 01:50:53,359
high that very first time

2911
01:50:53,819 --> 01:50:57,079
started to hit me

2912
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:01,639
