interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,379
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,280
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,280
to the underground

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,819
can you kind of Enlighten us a little

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,679
bit on on Mark Emery both of you just

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,359
give us a quick take from a Canadian

21
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,039
perspective on Mark Emery because we

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,839
don't have a really clear one at least

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,179
from my era and point of view in the

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,180
United States well like one thing I'm

25
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,399
not sure about was Mark Emery involved

26
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,460
in cannabis cannabis before like the

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,978
hemp Nation constitutional challenge no

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,140
no no no wait well the Constitutional

29
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,640
challenge he started NPC by that time

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,640
but you have to remember Mark's from

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,439
this town from my town yeah yeah

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,459
um he had a bookstore here called City

33
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,279
Lights

34
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:20,519
he scam those people also when it came

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,259
to selling it but um Mark

36
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,399
um I call him the dark enemy for a

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,099
reason

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,500
um I think it's very suiting it on it

39
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,019
ironically matches his name but he is

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,060
somebody that you know in his own word

41
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,200
said he was against legalization of

42
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,299
cannabis

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,780
due to the amount of money that he was

44
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,439
making from selling seeds illegally yeah

45
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:47,400
um he proved this when

46
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,199
um after hemp nation was busted for the

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,759
second time well first time was Great

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,560
Canadian Emporium second time it was

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,640
Temptation yeah

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
um

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,799
the

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,780
uh Chris was not allowed to sell

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,340
paraphernalia after that

54
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,280
so

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,479
we desire he decided that

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,400
um he reached out to to Mark who had NBC

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,080
and said Hey listen do you want to buy

58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,360
all the inventory from hemp Nation

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,340
because we need to raise the money for

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,379
the Constitutional challenge

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,500
and he agreed he's like yeah send me

62
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:25,019
everything and then it was like pulling

63
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,479
teeth to get paid from him and by the

64
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,520
very end of it I mean it wasn't a

65
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,759
shitload of money you know maybe it was

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,159
only 10 20 grand or something like that

67
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,679
in inventory but when you're fighting

68
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,560
the government to legalize cannabis

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,019
every penny counts sure and Chris kept

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,239
getting the you know oh talk to my

71
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:49,620
account and talk to my accountant at

72
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,259
this time it was in around this time uh

73
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,019
uh friends of mine through through Red

74
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,299
from Legends a mutual friend worked for

75
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,819
for Mark

76
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,300
uh basically almost as like manager area

77
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:05,878
of sales for his direct seats yeah and

78
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,719
he was doing something like

79
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:11,579
20 40 60 000 a week in cannabis sales

80
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,560
and Seed sales

81
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,980
wow and when it was all said and done

82
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,860
with hemp Nation Chris Klein uh uh

83
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,598
bankruptcy with Mark Emery still owing

84
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,220
him money and it was only maybe a

85
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,139
thousand or two thousand dollars at the

86
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,259
end of it but it kind of just showed

87
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:31,799
what the term douchebag and yeah wrote

88
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:34,378
my use of the word douchebag

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,739
I I have to start saving it for like the

90
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:39,539
appropriate people and dark enemy is I

91
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,120
feel the biggest douchebag in our

92
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,579
industry he you know claims that he

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,120
donated all this money and stuff like

94
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,700
that but he didn't he uh he would you

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,099
know he did a a interview and I think it

96
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,699
was on like CBC or something

97
00:03:53,098 --> 00:04:00,119
and Jody him and Jody and him were

98
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:03,060
together for less than a year maybe and

99
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,539
he's sitting there having her like click

100
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,580
his toenails on camera while he's being

101
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,139
interviewed and I think he's my mistake

102
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,939
he got up and he was butt naked or

103
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,399
something like that and I was just like

104
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:17,879
what kind of [ __ ] douchebag again the

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,858
word douchebag yeah uh lets or allows

106
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,519
his girlfriend

107
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,680
who was barely out of being a teenager

108
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,500

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,620
probably if I asked her to yeah but you

112
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,620
wouldn't ask yourself in a [ __ ]

113
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,139
lifetime ask for her to do it on camera

114
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,600
the show crazy there was a big thing

115
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,439

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,259
inappropriate

117
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,699
I can't say I don't know of any charges

118

the display cases including the

169
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:51,418

172
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,019
bad-mouthing him and trying to be loud

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
enough that he would hear me yeah and

174
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,978
obviously he did because he called me up

175
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,000
one day on speakerphone with other

176
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:10,978
people in the background and uh and try

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,978
to [ __ ] me like try to make a scene

178
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:16,620
yeah I got the [ __ ] computers here I

179
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,959

180
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,840
and what date and how much you owed at

181
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,579
the very end you tell me he's like Peter

182
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,138
who's only [ __ ] thousand bucks a

183
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,359
couple thousand bucks I don't give a

184
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,800
[ __ ] you still love it in colors man we

185
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,020
were trying to [ __ ] change the laws

186
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,879
Chris went to [ __ ] jail for this

187
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:35,219
um Sarah went to jail for this this

188
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,098
guy's out there making tens if not

189
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,280
hundreds of thousands of dollars a month

190
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:43,079
yeah and he's gonna stiff some [ __ ]

191
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,739
guy that's trying to fight the marijuana

192
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,120
laws so that he can do that and now this

193
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,460
comes through word of mouth but the

194
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,038
people that tell me this kind of thing

195
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,318
um I give 10 times a thousand times more

196
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,918
credit than I give Mark yeah and they

197
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,080
said you know he'll admit that off

198
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,359
record obviously that why would he want

199
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:06,060
to legalize cannabis when he makes so

200
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
much money off the fact that it is

201
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,240
illegal

202
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,038
and especially in the states he wasn't

203
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,819
charged in Canada he was charged in the

204
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:17,219
states yeah right like [ __ ] buddy like

205
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,080
moved to the states I mean I'm I'm all

206
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,180
for spreading the seed everywhere we

207
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,359
don't want him use that [ __ ] you know

208
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,918
and what got me also was back then I was

209
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,960
actually

210
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,299
breeding I'll do air quotes because it's

211
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,399
not I was just breeding for seed to get

212
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,060
the seed out there and again we're going

213
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,259
back to the mid 90s kind of thing

214
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,778
um

215
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,939
we would send Mark seeds and this when

216
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,519
he was first started his uh seed

217
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,740
business and uh we would tell him or

218
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,600
whatever it was a buck a seat or

219
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,299
a couple bucks a seat or something like

220
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,759
that and we'd be honest like listen like

221
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,699
I told in the last interview I would buy

222
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,639
seeds from uh Scentsy or Greenhouse or

223
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,259
something and then do a breeding just

224
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,019
using those genetics and saying Hey

225
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:07,620
listen this is

226
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,120
um this is our Northern Lights we bought

227
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,799
the it's a Northern Lights five we

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,200
bought the seed we made our own seed

229
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,120
we're selling it right yeah or we would

230
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,620
say well we liked uh we wanted to blend

231
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,419
it so we did like a Northern Lights

232
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,820
chemo which was something that we really

233
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,259
liked and we would sell Mark the seeds

234
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,240
and he would change the names or he

235
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:25,980
would remove certain things like he

236
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,820
would just call the Northern Lights

237
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,899
chemo just chemo right yeah

238
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,000
itself better

239
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,919
right yeah so he was didn't want us when

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,740
he when it came to what he was selling

241
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,259
and um you know it didn't happen he

242
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,778
wasn't he wasn't selling it as you know

243
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,939
Scentsy seeds [ __ ] Northern Lights he

244
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:46,439
was just saying hey this is pure

245
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,820
Northern Lights but it wasn't pure it

246
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,120
was [ __ ] bread

247
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,580
by me or or hemp Nation crew and or in a

248
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,379
hemp Nation Garden or my garden and we

249
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,240
were just doing it to spread the Johnny

250
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,338
Appleseed we wanted to sell this yeah

251
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,980
you know we were selling I think it was

252
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,320
uh 10 seats or 25 bucks if something 250

253
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,080
a seat to get it out yeah the thing

254
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,580
right so you know people that again I've

255
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,240
even said in the last year people that

256
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,740
focus on the money in this industry

257
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,299
uh are in the industry not the movement

258
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,639
and people that claim to be in the

259
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,799
movement like Mark does you know and he

260
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,319
he was hiding behind Jody

261
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,958
till the very end right like I don't

262
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,519
know a [ __ ] is wrong with that and I'm

263
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,899
not going to get in any personal [ __ ]

264
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,639
because there's some

265
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,820
[ __ ] he's done to friends of mine

266
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,100
personally yeah I mean if you if you

267
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,839
Google Mark Emery and you look for stuff

268
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,839
it's like there's stuff out there it's

269
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,380
like when he got out west I I think it

270
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,360
got worse you know it's all about ego he

271
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,820
always me and my friends

272
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,740
when we were out in Vancouver we

273
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,500
wouldn't step foot in the shop no like

274
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,299
on that strip like like we wouldn't like

275
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,220
we didn't even want to go into his

276
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,559
establishment like that's how much we

277
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,278
disliked him we just knew like he was a

278
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,018
piece of [ __ ] like [ __ ] him yeah

279
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,700
again he's it's about self-promotion

280
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,339
with him it's nothing to do with the

281
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,320
movement he's not one of them he was

282
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,019
anything but [ __ ] you know he went to

283
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,100
I think it was Thailand before he went

284
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,259
out west

285
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,879
you know uh or maybe it was during

286
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,399
because he went out there and like

287
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,778
dropped a bunch of money on some locals

288
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,240
said hey I just bought this property

289
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:26,578
here's [ __ ] x amount of dollars I

290
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,680
want a [ __ ] house and I come back you

291
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:31,019
know when he came back he went back

292
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,559
there the land was just overgrown

293
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:37,259
nothing built and his money was gone

294
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:39,719
so yes I I would honestly wish that

295
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:42,059
there wasn't so many you know he comes

296
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,620
back to this town and he thinks he's

297
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,919
[ __ ] He's ran for political office

298
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,839
last year yes oh yeah and uh it was

299
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,240
hilarious because every time I drove by

300
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,640
him I would call him a [ __ ] douchebag

301
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,320
yeah don't listen you're not liked

302
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,659
around here get the [ __ ] out he got very

303
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,399
little votes and the funny thing is is I

304
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:01,740
was either driving my Volkswagen bus and

305
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,480
my Volkswagen Karma gear on my truck or

306
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,639
my Mini Cooper or my Jeep I was always

307
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,259
driving something different so he's

308
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,240
probably thought the whole [ __ ] I'm I

309
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,759
know I hope other people join me but

310
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,379
yeah I was [ __ ] yelling at him left

311
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,360
right and Center because

312
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,679
he doesn't [ __ ] live here while he

313
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,659
might live here now I don't even know I

314
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,699
think he moved back here for a while I

315
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:23,219
can't believe he would go back honestly

316
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,680
like I like when I lived there I didn't

317
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,680
know one person that had anything to say

318
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,479
but negative but negative he he didn't

319
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,199
choose to leave London right he had to

320
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,180
leave he ended up he ended up [ __ ] he

321
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,800
saw he ended up [ __ ] a fireman's wife

322
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,019
and I don't for for some reason I

323
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,278
thought he was fairly high up in the

324
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,639
fire department I don't know if he was a

325
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:48,600
chief or or something like that but uh

326
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,459
rumor has it yeah they walked into his

327
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,560
[ __ ] bookstore

328
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,179
and so there's a lot of paper in here

329
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,799
this is probably place would probably go

330
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,958
up pretty quickly and sometimes we hit

331
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,899
red lights or something along that line

332
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,819
was said yeah kind of thing right all

333
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,039
right and again could have been folklore

334
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,620
it could have been anything but because

335
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,860
you know I knew the type of person I

336
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,379
know the type of person he is yeah for

337
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,259
sure see that so you know it sucks to

338
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:18,419
see people like that get all the

339
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,519
attention and it gives us a bad name

340
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,578
yeah yeah people out there especially as

341
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,278
a Canadian like yeah

342
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:28,379
what the [ __ ] like come on like that was

343
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:31,200
yeah especially like in BC he kept going

344
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:34,078
in BC it's like yeah well let's you know

345
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,500
well let's let's get to this so the one

346
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,958
thing that was resounding the resounding

347
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,200
criticism from the last episode was that

348
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:46,399
there were but one or two really loud BC

349
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Growers that that they were

350
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,778
misrepresented very extreme can you can

351
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,120
you explain to Sean better than me I I

352
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:55,740
before like when before we did the first

353
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,679
one before we even recorded the first

354
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,320
one in our little homie chat I said

355
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:04,379
there's gonna be some BC people pissed

356
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,240
off yeah and I have I have a specific

357
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,700
question in mind but I didn't even ask

358
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,519
that question and they still got upset

359
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,278
but I actually went back and listened

360
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,919
and I know what he what the one guy at

361
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:20,100
least was upset about and and it was

362
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,379
that Pete said it all started here I was

363
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,000
like yup and then there was a comment

364
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:25,799
about of course there's there's good

365
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,039
growers in PC they're all from Ontario

366
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,500
yeah but he was like this you know yeah

367
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,620
whatever well but

368
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,179
very specific uh Viewpoint right yeah

369
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,459
but

370
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,620
hey doctor that's so I'm Back Where I

371
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:43,559
Come From right like I grew up in London

372
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,060
so I grew up around like I like there is

373
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,099
like commercial what my friends called

374
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,439
bikerweed right which was just the

375
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,259
commercial right yeah

376
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,420
but once once you've found like that

377
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,939
like fan that downtown family which was

378
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,399
not hard to find you know

379
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,500
um you look you got great pot right yeah

380
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,899
yeah whether you were getting it from

381
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,698
well whatever I'm not gonna name but

382
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:08,159
like

383
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:10,559
so me and my friends like you know we

384
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,059
went on tour right we were like [ __ ]

385
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,979
this we're going on dead tour and we

386
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,859
just wanted to like we wanted to see the

387
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,959
shows because we we were heads but we

388
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,180
also wanted to see [ __ ] pot you know

389
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,399
that was like the two were just as equal

390
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:26,099
so we went down we did tour for a while

391
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,940
that led us to the west coast of the us

392
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,040
and we we saw that area and like

393
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,160
we were kind of like blown away like

394
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,019
number one the cost we could not [ __ ]

395
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,719
believe people were paying what they

396
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,578
were paying like that was just

397
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,100
mind-blowing right because it was

398
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:45,719
comparable to back home to us yeah and

399
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,060
then when we got to the West Coast it's

400
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,800
like same thing but like the only like

401
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,319
the only thing about the west coast is

402
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,879
we saw new stuff that like names we'd

403
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
never heard of and obviously there was

404
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,659
people breeding there right because it

405
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,578
was all this weird new [ __ ] it was the

406
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:01,500
first time I saw like white weed right

407
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:03,899
like it looked like mold in somebody's

408
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,899
hand but they're like no that's you know

409
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,659
that's [ __ ] you know resin

410
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,339
and then you know I lived in Arcata for

411
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,319
a while right so I lived in Arcata for a

412
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,560
good stretch and like I was there for a

413
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,240
while so I kind of saw and experienced

414
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,099
what was going on in that area and it

415
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
was really good weed like back home

416
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,899
though you know like for me it was like

417
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
what we had back home and then I got

418
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,759
back home and like I went into Pete shop

419
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,620
to like chat him up because back home

420
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,939
there's not too many people that you

421
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,799
could talk about that stuff and they

422
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,279
understand what you're talking about

423
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,740
and at the same time it was taking me

424
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,539
out to Vancouver with him right and

425
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,299
Pete's response was like you were just

426
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,639
like disappointed super disappointed

427
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,740
and you're like everybody goes out west

428
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,740
and they think the weed is so much

429
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,959
better there and it's not it's not you

430
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,539
know and I think and like I said I stand

431
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:01,078
by the what I said before about

432
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:03,480
um uh all the good Growers

433
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,220
well I would say all but I can't say all

434
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,539
right because we don't know yeah I'm

435
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,039
gonna say a large percentage and I'll

436
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:12,240
give you a few examples because a large

437
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:15,418
percentage I I got hired uh after a

438
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,838
state in Switzerland by a one of the

439
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:22,439
larger brokers in

440
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:24,240
um the Vancouver area and uh like red he

441
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,959
was named after a different color let's

442
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,058
just say blue and um

443
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,660
and I think he's from Ontario too

444
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:35,519
honestly but uh so they they brought me

445
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,340
into this middle of butt [ __ ] nowhere

446
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,980
between Jasper and Kamloops along uh I

447
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,759
think it's Highway five and

448
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,160
um

449
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,558
built a huge Greenhouse in the middle of

450
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,160
the Bush off grid I lived in a little

451
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:54,119
Log Cabin off grid or they already had

452
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,900
a 300 uh 300 bales of pro-mix hiked into

453
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:59,639
a bush and big huge uh outdoor beds and

454
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,559
I thought [ __ ] right man I'm in the

455
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,120
middle of [ __ ] nowhere I'm finally

456
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,819
gonna meet some of these you know

457
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,038
grassroot BC Growers that I [ __ ]

458
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,740
heard about and read about didn't meet

459
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:14,819
[ __ ] one person from BC every single

460
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,339
person I met was from Ontario or I'd say

461
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:20,220
80 from Ontario and the rest were kind

462
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,319
of mixed so when you go out to uh to

463
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,160
Vancouver and the island and stuff like

464
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,798
that

465
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,480
you know yeah ask ask anybody where you

466
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:28,980
from I'm from BC I was like really where

467
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,319
were you born what part like I was born

468
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,419
in Etobicoke what the [ __ ] is that very

469
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,980
rare

470
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:37,559
six months ago well no you're not from

471
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,919
[ __ ] BC you know they all in the 90s

472
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:43,379
it was very rare like most people that

473
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,360
are from BC were born in the [ __ ] 90s

474
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,880
you know yeah like it just wasn't

475
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,298
populated it wasn't populated the

476
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,980
population was Tiny and like what I was

477
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,319
told actually I'm not sure if it's

478
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,259
totally true but I think it's believable

479
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:01,139
was like in the 80s they were offering

480
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,298
offering stimulus sort of situations for

481
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,520
people to move to BC because it was so

482
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,379
underpopulated and they were even like

483
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,879
doing that to like you know lower income

484
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,340
people like we'll give you money and

485
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,620
we'll give you a free trip to go to you

486
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:16,199
know the [ __ ] Vancouver area like it

487
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,219
just wasn't populated right so by the

488
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,580
90s

489
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,400
the great majority was not from there it

490
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:25,379
just that's it's true the Cannabis moved

491
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,360
out there again like why everybody moves

492
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,000
out there they think well you know it's

493
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,099
beautiful it's more climatized and so on

494
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,038
all the power to them for sure you know

495
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:36,480
but again the genetics and the the

496
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,058
techniques and the and the information

497
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,339
in their heads it's come from Ontario I

498
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,899
mean there's a a breeder out on the

499
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:46,678
island he thinks he's a pretty great

500
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:49,980
Gardener I think he's okay you know

501
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,919
um besides you know

502
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,079
um but he's not from [ __ ] BC you know

503
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,660
he's from he's from this [ __ ] town

504
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,220
you know but like recently maybe dark

505
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,380
enemies from here Chris Clay Chris

506
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,500
Clay's from here you know I don't know

507
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,000
about you know some of the other Growers

508
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,640
sure there's phenomenal Growers

509
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,500
everywhere BC definitely has but we're

510
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,120
seeing a lot of podcasts now right like

511
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,619
this where a lot of people are speaking

512
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:20,279
out and like see Ray not from BC scabby

513
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:22,558
not from BC Jay not from BC like every

514
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,279
single person that that has spoken out

515
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,418
about BC is not from BC right right I

516
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,339
don't think we've heard what I almost

517
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,220
moved out to BC I mean I got I got bit

518
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,720
by the bug also like everybody and

519
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,900
um just some beautiful [ __ ] people

520
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,519
out there and it is a lot stronger there

521
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,559
because the laws were a lot more

522
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,319
forgiving there it is

523
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,940
um but you know when it when push comes

524
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,740
to shove you ask the people like okay

525
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,140
where are you from

526
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,298
if they say BC ask them where they're

527
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,100
born because you know it's not like they

528
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:55,440
I'm surprised they got [ __ ] maternity

529
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,119
Wards in [ __ ] Vancouver because

530
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,500
nobody's from [ __ ] Vancouver but

531
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,959
there's some there's some right like

532
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,519
like

533
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,500
less than an hour I was off the plane we

534
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,480
were smoking texts at a time warp yeah

535
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,599
and like there was a whole bunch of

536
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,660
Americans there like like our whole like

537
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,538
deadhead crew that was in Vancouver like

538
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,480
we were strong supporters of the island

539
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:20,640
organic outdoor you know like that was

540
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,140
good [ __ ] it wasn't good yeah that'd be

541
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,538
a good story for red too if you ever

542
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,280
want to break

543
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:28,319
but there's a lot of cool people in BC

544
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,720
there's a lot of good growers in BC and

545
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,819
if somebody's like insulted at the fact

546
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,620
that like BC isn't everything maybe

547
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,500
you're not growing great weed if you're

548
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:41,759
that insecure you know yeah I mean I can

549
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,339
throw like obviously like I Mendo Mendo

550
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:48,359
has some similarities and humble too

551
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:49,798
because like as like you know you start

552
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,259
talking about like oh well where were

553
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,480
you born you know and I mean I'm a

554
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,179
transplant out here now granted I ended

555
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,120
up getting here a lot earlier

556
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,919
um you know like uh than most people and

557
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,158
I've lived out here a long time but I'm

558
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,980
not from here right and you know when

559
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,080
you look at the map of Canada almost all

560
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,259
Canadians are from where

561
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,480
you guys are yeah in the large

562
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:16,919
population Southwestern Ontario and like

563
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,620
I was saying before in the last podcast

564
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,659
where because of how we're situated the

565
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:25,019
great lakes and glacial runoff we have

566
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:26,880
some of the best soil in Canada I mean

567
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,400
people don't probably realize this oil

568
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,380
in Canada Canada is a huge place but

569
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,980
like that's mostly you look at it like I

570
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,799
I think it's like 80 90 of the people in

571
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,599
Canada live within 100 kilometers of the

572
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,038
Border or something like that even even

573
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,558
that I was I was kind of like well

574
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,419
because like Matt thought when we said

575
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,899
London we're talking about BC like his

576
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:51,059
geography is like way out but like

577
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,159
I was trying to explain to like my

578
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:55,918
American friends that like we can't just

579
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:59,460
say Ontario we can't just say BC because

580
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,440
it's too huge like BC right I was just

581
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,058
saying even the coastal area you have

582
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,340
all these independent islands that are

583
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:07,379
like a place in themselves then you have

584
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:09,899
Vancouver then you have like the the

585
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,640
Vancouver Island which could be split up

586
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,380
in sections then you have the Kootenays

587
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,419
which is like [ __ ] 12 hours down the

588
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,100
road that way like it's just totally

589
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:22,200
different places and when you say BC

590
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:25,619
like I'm sure the Coots had much better

591
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,500
um Quality because it was smaller and

592
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:30,839
the Vancouver area and the coastal area

593
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,298
was so big it was so commercial that it

594
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,240
was just it gets flooded with commercial

595
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:38,279
yeah it was so [ __ ] flooded with

596
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,319
commercial it was hard to find good weed

597
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,000
because there was so much commercial to

598
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,619
get rid of it was like nobody had time

599
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,298
to even think about quality it was just

600
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:47,399
like I think it's because a lot of the

601
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,839
organized uh Growers organized crime

602
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,220
Growers yeah

603
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,199
that's where they were going to be

604
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,200
around but when you get into like the

605
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,419
Kootenays to Nelson area you know when

606
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,279
you get into the kind family mentality

607
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:01,860
that still grow For the Love of the the

608
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,839
plant so yeah again air quality the

609
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,939
movement people not the industry people

610
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,038
if you're in the industry you are going

611
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,440
to be in probably Vancouver uh you're

612
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:12,538
going to be someplace west of Hope

613
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,840
um and south of Whistler kind of thing

614
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:17,700
and then you uh get on onto the island

615
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,519
same thing you're going to get more of

616
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,980
the the kind family uh Vibe and

617
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:25,099
mentality right yeah I spent some time

618
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,779
out in Nelson and win law that area

619
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:29,819
Nelson and they were just like you know

620
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:33,538
what they grew phenomenal I named my dog

621
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:35,700
yeah it was called you know our friend

622
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,980
our I gotta mention because he passed

623
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,100
away I don't know a couple years ago

624
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:44,279
maybe cormy's arms yeah yeah he passed

625
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,558
away uh not long ago but he he was like

626
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:47,940
a lot of our friends are there right a

627
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,178
lot of the people we grew up are there

628
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,179
yeah

629
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:57,058
I would say like of that of like like my

630
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,879
age people that were brought up there

631
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:02,279
like 90 went to the Coots I would say

632
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,440
like the drum circles I used to have at

633
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,658
organic we used to have all like the the

634
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,500
hippies that would hippie kids I call

635
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,659
them like

636
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,859
kids were your age maybe even a little

637
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,120
bit younger

638
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,319
um yeah they used to all come to the

639
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,939
organic travel of food because I did

640
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,899
drum circles on Sundays or something

641
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,340
like that I say 90 of them ended out in

642
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,038
the Nelson area and probably a good

643
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,079
portion of them [ __ ] played in wasabi

644
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,058
kind of thing like they were all well

645
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,639
but that's the thing like

646
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,319
there was uh

647
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,538
uh in London they were called kangaroo

648
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,778
right this band they were like a little

649
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:38,759
fun damn band called kangaroo but like

650
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:40,558
they all like when they

some right and like and that kind of

673
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,700

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,058
when I talk about you know Legend seeds

675

they're old friends and I I listen back

678
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,460
on my uh on the last podcast and I use

679
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,140
the words the term we a lot when I talk

680
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,659
about these guys because because they're

681
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,880
friends yeah but when it came to their

682
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,740
breeding and stuff like that Legends and

683
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,679
and Sol

684
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,220
um I was just I wasn't part of their

685
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,200
um

686
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,000
their company or part of their their

687
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,460
group I was friends with them I was

688
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,380
there I might have you know

689
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,640
um did whatever they wanted me to do

690
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,440
kind of thing as helping out a friend

691
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,659
but I wasn't ever when I say we I don't

692
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,159
mean I helped breed anything with these

693
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,559
that is a friend's Circle it was like

694
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,500
yeah it was and it brought me to another

695
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:18,119
point where in my book there's a typo

696
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,038
which I'm surprised

697
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,199
uh Steve hasn't

698
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,379
come and [ __ ] try to fire by my house

699
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,200
yet but when we were talking about the

700
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,120
uh the fast fear which we spoke about oh

701
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,900
yeah you said that though the last one

702
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,899
you said this already

703
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,880
was on the on the very last paragraph of

704
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:42,119
the one

705
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,320
um chapter it says I it was supposed to

706
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:50,939
say I grew an award-winning strain okay

707
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:53,759
and it said I bread uh sure and but it

708
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,860
taught oh the whole chapter it just

709
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,778
talks about me being a grower and being

710
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:59,879
a grower there and working for Mr hemp

711
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:02,940
and you know I answered to Steve it was

712
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,760
his program and uh but the very last

713
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,259
thing was just it was a typo and Greg

714
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,200
brought it up and I was like oh [ __ ] man

715
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:12,179
Steve's gonna kill me because he thinks

716
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,919
I'm trying to you know yeah steal his

717
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:17,759
[ __ ] Limelight even though he stole

718
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,159
my medal but uh trying to Jack his STEEZ

719
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,278
you know I think that's a common thing

720
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,620
in cannabis actually because of how in

721
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,778
the shadows and clandestine it is yeah I

722
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:30,538
do the same thing dude where some of the

723
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:32,099
stories I tell where it's we it's like

724
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:34,259
there's people that are known and

725
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:36,000
there's people that are unknown some of

726
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:38,460
those people that are unknown wish to

727
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,380
remain unknown yeah you know and so

728
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,079
you're trying to tell history and tell a

729
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,059
story but you have to sort of edit it to

730
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,939
some degree because what you're giving

731
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:50,158
is accurate information right and then

732
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,259
the flip side of that is that there's

733
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,720
people

734
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:58,140
that wannabe can of famous yeah right

735
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,940
and they want to aggregate all the fame

736
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,980
to them and so even if it might have

737
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,200
been a collective of friends all doing

738
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,700
it they're going to tell the story like

739
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,400
it was them alone in their basement

740
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,840
working for 10 years and then they came

741
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,759
out with all this and no one else has

742
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,199
[ __ ] to do with it when you know

743
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,419
personally that there was like seven

744
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,980
other dudes and it was this loose

745
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,380
Collective of friends that were all

746
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,058
involved in this breeding happened at

747
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,919
this house then and then this accident

748
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:25,259
happened over here and then this

749
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,200
happened and it can be kind of weird to

750
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:31,019
tell stories that way because a lot of

751
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,360
money is made on

752
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:36,179
you know every breeder and mics except

753
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,339
for maybe Neville but most breeders are

754
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,278
like well no Neville was very clear

755
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:43,319
about I got this from this person

756
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:45,839
I did this and this almost all breeders

757
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:48,658
after him were like this never existed

758
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,058
before I carefully crafted it and no one

759
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,100
else has had any of these genetics ever

760
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:54,778
yeah

761
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:58,139
[ __ ] land race kind of yeah like like

762
00:29:54,778 --> 00:30:01,019
they just obscure yeah

763
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,538
I'm gonna break in because like not to

764
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,220
interrupt the flow but I didn't get to

765
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:07,500
actually ask my question when we were

766
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,899
talking about the BC stuff and I want to

767
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,819
ask this question do it so we're gonna

768
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:13,918
but it kind of is the same thing because

769
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:16,439
it's a dishonesty thing or like an

770
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,600
illusion thing I guess you would say but

771
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,740
like that conversation going back to

772
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,898
that conversation when you were

773
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,120
disappointed

774
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:25,379
um you mentioned something and at the

775
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,359
time you mentioned it I kind of thought

776
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,500
you were crazy like I didn't like I

777
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,819
didn't know because I didn't know right

778
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,119
when somebody tells you something you

779
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:35,639
don't know you're kind of like what but

780
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:37,979
you said something about High Times and

781
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,860
hyping

782
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,399
what's that magazine or the store

783
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:46,678
the magazine that like BC was only got

784
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:49,259
really popular because High Times was

785
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,580
hyping them to kind of draw attention to

786
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:53,519
them

787
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:57,359
do you remember this conversation

788
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,639
no no well what I what I remember which

789
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,398
this could be totally false was that you

790
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,200
were like BC was like hyping up the big

791
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,898
bud because at the time like BC was

792
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,980
really blowing up as like right but you

793
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,898
were like

794
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,179
the magazine was kind of like trying to

795
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:16,219
draw attention from the US and DEA

796
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,220
attention to to BC

797
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:20,759
um I don't remember that conversation

798
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,179
but I mean part of that sounded a little

799
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:26,879
familiar okay I think what High Times is

800
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:31,019
trying to pimp was because California

801
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,580
was such a huge market for cannabis

802
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:34,200
Counter Culture yeah right because High

803
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:36,119
Times isn't a Canada's magazine right

804
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,399
it's a chemical for magazine so that's

805
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:40,678
why it has so much music it has so much

806
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,298
uh cannabis is only a section of it

807
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,980
right and then for a few years they got

808
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:45,778
rid of it right they didn't have canvas

809
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,339
for a few years

810
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,980
um and that's when they started grow

811
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:53,579
America for for a little bit but

812
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,819
um I think because the term BC Bud right

813
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:59,220
anything Canada was BC Bud right right

814
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:01,678
right so

815
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:05,278
um I think they were pimping that

816
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,980
as well as because of the climate you

817
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:11,099
could have larger outdoor grows than we

818
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,558
could in Ontario okay

819
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:14,819
um they wouldn't go into Quebec where

820
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,178
you could also have fairly large

821
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:21,178
outgrows because of the language barrier

822
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,480
um so I think for High Times

823
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:27,120
I wouldn't say I know for for a fact but

824
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:31,019
pretty damn sure with my interaction

825
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:35,579
with them that they were pushing the BC

826
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:38,879
Bud because of its popularity in

827
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:41,099
California because your top dollar you

828
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,340
know anything from your tuna cans

829
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:48,240
[ __ ] anything that was the BC bud got

830
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:52,439
the top dollar and then I mean I mean

831
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,038
there's a name that we mentioned uh in

832
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,778
our last talk and he was a broker he's

833
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,140
still in the industry he's I think he's

834
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:03,599
a [ __ ] great guy he knows he knows a

835
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,559
lot of history of this uh of this

836
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,000
movement

837
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:11,339
from the West Coast but he was a broker

838
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,919
and uh he used to sell be able to sell a

839
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:16,639
certain type of outdoor

840
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,019
and it was uh it was a pink something

841
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,340
but uh he was selling for twenty nine

842
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:22,679
hundred dollars

843
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:26,038
a pound for hours

844
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:29,100
to LA because it was that's nothing

845
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,839
though people were selling 32.

846
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:32,158
for out yeah I realized that but this is

847
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,500
outdoor

848
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,899
um what year is this I was Canadian or

849
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,480
U.S what year

850
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:41,939
oh okay okay

851
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,019
the beaster era yeah I would say like

852
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:48,000
late 90s yeah so like stuff and I it was

853
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,500
so it was strained I think it was called

854
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,558
sotica

855
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,058
cream sodica cream sodica yeah so we

856
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,538
grew that out in Switzerland actually

857
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:59,220
yeah and uh the guy that's growing it is

858
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,259
a I'm gonna use the word douchebag again

859
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,120
which I said I was trying not to use but

860
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:06,179
this guy's a [ __ ] douchebag he ran

861
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,819
the uh farm that I was uh hired to work

862
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,820
on in uh in the interior

863
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,019
and um his name's Jay I don't know his

864
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,899
last name I wish I knew his last name

865
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:17,639
but I'd say it here too what was the

866
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:20,338
cream sodaka like I the first time I

867
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:24,358
ever saw that it was really unique uh

868
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:27,418
plant uh it had really bright uh pink

869
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:31,139
stigmas in it where

870
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:35,098
um it wasn't a huge producer but it it

871
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,960
grew kind of like a really short kind of

872
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,879
like the pink freeze land which I

873
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,000
wouldn't be surprised if it might have

874
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,098
you know again traveled West which a lot

875
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,378
of genetics did back in the day as we

876
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,879
talked about before that was just like

877
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,739
you know it wasn't a very strong

878
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:52,079
structured plant but it just grew all

879
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:53,638
these golf balls that just would I mean

880
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,159
maybe a little bit easier to trim but

881
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,800
just look beautiful rock hard it would

882
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,539
give you the the BC bag of marbles again

883
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,480
it's kind of what I call a lot of the

884
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,820
you know any pot that comes across my

885
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,740
desk nowadays I can basically look at it

886
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,680
and tell you where it come from by bag

887
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:13,559
appeal because you know BC had the

888
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:16,199
tendency for a while there of not

889
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,779
trimming the pot but shaping it so every

890
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,779
nug looked like a [ __ ] marble right

891
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:24,359
yeah right you know but I mean is back

892
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,280
when they were making tons of extract

893
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:28,980
so they were trimming off a lot of the

894
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,720
stuff because they knew they were going

895
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,460
to be able to use it kind of thing and

896
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,739
then you got the bag of marbles the BC

897
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,960
bag of marbles that uh was just kind of

898
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:38,399
a look so I think that the cream sodica

899
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,579
was um

900
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,800
uh was a strain that was

901
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,800
kind of easy for their outdoor to look

902
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,180
like indoor yeah and that's why bubble

903
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,780
was able to [ __ ]

904
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:53,578
you know for ridiculous amounts of money

905
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,920
I mean that strain out here called West

906
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,200
Coast dog like that it's just outdoor

907
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,599
for indoor type [ __ ] that's been the

908
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,098
game I mean and where I live in Mendo

909
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,859
it's like that's been the game forever

910
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,500
of yeah Brokers being like well this

911
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:09,119
outdoor pass is light depth yeah does

912
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,699
this light depth look good enough to

913
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,740
pass as indoor yeah um because where

914
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:16,199
there was uneducated areas of the

915
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:18,299
country or whatever they were like can I

916
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,419
can I put this into a different bracket

917
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,760
right can I buy this for what it is but

918
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,320
claim it's the next grade up there's

919
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,240
tons of people I mean again that's the

920
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,880
that's the industry envelope in the

921
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:32,219
movement the movement right because

922
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,500
there's going to be people like myself

923
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:36,959
that say Hey listen you know

924
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,900
it's outdoor looks like indoor you know

925
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,420
but [ __ ] I I'm gonna be honest with you

926
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,740
and if you want to be dishonest after

927
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,300
that that's up to you but I'm probably

928
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:48,358
going to charge you

929
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,880
[ __ ] uh more money you're gonna pay a

930
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,039
[ __ ] tax on something that looks

931
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,380
spectacular I don't give a [ __ ] if it's

932
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:58,079
indoor outdoor or [ __ ] Greenhouse or

933
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,780
you know small crop large crop you know

934
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,619
hand trim machine trim you know like

935
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,079
there's there's so many variables at the

936
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,420
end of the day if it [ __ ] looks good

937
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,640
smells good and [ __ ] kicks you in the

938
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,639
nuts then what the [ __ ] who cares how

939
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:16,799
it's grown for me I think like what do

940
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,139
we what do we do when we grow indoor all

941
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,400
we're trying to do is mimic outdoor

942
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:22,500
we're trying to mimic from other nature

943
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,200
mother nature has the [ __ ] the

944
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,539
formula down where now we're able to

945
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,598
with technology and so on we're a lot we

946
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,338
can better mother nature but for the

947
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,859
longest time we were just trying to

948
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:38,880
reproduce Outside Inside

949
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:42,000
I do think we can do everything better

950
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,838
than nature indoor yeah except for the

951
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,119
Sun

952
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,578
no no of course you can I mean the sun

953
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,820
is the sun's still by far is the best

954
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,060
light right and I've done all kinds of

955
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,640
spectrum experience

956
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:59,039
and all this and you know to some degree

957
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,319
it's interesting too because like all

958
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,380
almost all of the award-winning hash

959
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:08,400
made in California is all made with the

960
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:11,220
Sun right you know they don't use indoor

961
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,260
grown stock indoor might get you know

962
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:14,459
humans are so visual that indoor might

963
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,140
look prettier

964
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,480
right you know

965
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:20,279
um and I I also wanted to make a comment

966
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,380
when you guys were talking about Ontario

967
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,119
you know just different areas there

968
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,780
could be a lot just for the simple fact

969
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,358
that BC Bud Rhymes yeah yeah you know

970
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,160
yeah Southwestern Ontario nug doesn't

971
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:34,380
really like what do you what do you call

972
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,838
Ontario weed like so you know I live in

973
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,700
Mendocino County or whatever and like

974
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,880
whether it came from Trinity or

975
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:44,519
Mendocino or Sonoma or or whatnot if it

976
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,760
went on dead tour it was Humboldt County

977
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:49,019
organic outdoor yeah exactly well and

978
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,200
that's what I was going to say like what

979
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:54,300
you were mentioning is you know humble

980
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,460
is the BC of uh

981
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,560
of the states pretty much right like

982
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:02,039
anybody that was anybody that wanted to

983
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,539
be a pot grower moved to California then

984
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,420
once they were like oh we're in

985
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,219
California now what do we do like humble

986
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,619
again probably didn't have a [ __ ]

987
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:13,500
Maternity Ward didn't need one because

988
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:15,660
there was only a few [ __ ] people that

989
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,280
live there and then all of a sudden the

990
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:19,559
Cannabis craze came and of course they

991
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,140
were like oh well I move up there I can

992
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,179
name it [ __ ] Humboldt County

993
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:26,519
yeah I'll tell you when I first moved to

994
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:28,919
Mendocino County in the 90s there was so

995
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,539
few people moving here from outside that

996
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,480
everyone thought I was a cop

997
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:36,179
yeah oh yeah also because because you

998
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,699
look like a cop yeah yeah yeah well you

999
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:40,319
know and [ __ ] that dude I I can tell you

1000
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:43,739
I mean we want to talk about dead tour

1001
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,079
the first time I saw a cop tackle

1002
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:49,739
somebody on the lot with dreadlocks down

1003
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:53,700
to his ass and then pull out handcuffs

1004
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:56,219
yeah I was like oh yeah yeah no no no

1005
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:58,139
I'd say you can't tell what a undercover

1006
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:59,819
cop looks like but you can tell what the

1007
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:01,739
regular cop looks like yeah I'm like

1008
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,539
that you know but the only reason I said

1009
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:06,239
that is because it was before like what

1010
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:08,759
we call the green Rush yeah where people

1011
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,578
weren't moving like people didn't move

1012
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,380
to the towns that I was moving to yeah

1013
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,480
like out-of-towners didn't come there

1014
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,700
within five six years as medical

1015
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,400
Advanced and sort of the green Rush

1016
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:22,799
occurred it got overwhelmed by much like

1017
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,900
you were saying with BC yeah almost none

1018
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,260
of the Growers from Mendo were born in

1019
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,059
Mendo right they were all transplants I

1020
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,160
mean there was a small core certainly

1021
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,559
that was from there yeah but if you

1022
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:38,358
added them up by like number it was

1023
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:41,159
probably like 90 90 10.

1024
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:44,279
that's the same thing with BC like again

1025
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:48,059
I'm not going to pull you know I I think

1026
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,240
BC has has produced and still does

1027
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:54,358
produce uh phenomenal Growers I'm just

1028
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:56,578
saying that back in the day most of

1029
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:59,219
those Growers and therefore a lot of

1030
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:02,820
their genetics

1031
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:05,519
um came from you know East or south

1032
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,460
I mean there's there's a debate on that

1033
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,619
too like not so much in but just in the

1034
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,720
sense of where is something from yeah

1035
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,160
exactly you know like like the you know

1036
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,078
we have this you know the whole thing

1037
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,219
came from came through that came through

1038
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,440
because there's this whole thing we're

1039
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:21,239
like oh the cush is from Florida

1040
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,800
well what's the story of the Kush and

1041
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:24,479
they're like oh well is this clone from

1042
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,000
the Emerald Triangle

1043
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,358
and then pollen from some stuff we got

1044
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,980
from Neville and Holland right but it

1045
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:35,159
happened in Florida

1046
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,440
right you know so I see and again back

1047
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,179
when I was growing the kush before it

1048
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,760
was kush kind of thing it was just

1049
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:44,460
basically the you know from the Kush

1050
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,200
region of Afghanistan like I would say

1051
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,599
if people say well where's the where's

1052
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:51,299
the Hindu Kush from well probably the

1053
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,880
Hindu Kush mountains right like these

1054
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,400
are they might have you know took a

1055
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,900
cutting or a seed you know they might

1056
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,700
have brought something back during the

1057
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,700
war times you know which a lot of the

1058
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:04,858
genetics did you know come from soldiers

1059
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:08,219
returning from [ __ ] overseas and

1060
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:11,699
bringing seed that they uh that they

1061
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:15,239
grabbed and planted in California

1062
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:17,879
Florida [ __ ] Wyoming anywhere

1063
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:20,759
everywhere sure it was just what ended

1064
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,039
up happening is where all the uh cool

1065
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,040
people or where the the population that

1066
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:28,619
were like-minded ended up moving to in

1067
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,838
Canada it would be BC you know in

1068
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:31,980
California it was going to be probably

1069
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:34,259
San Francisco

1070
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,858
or that area

1071
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,780
um

1072
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:39,960
following kind of the whole hippie

1073
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,280
movement and so on so I would say I

1074
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,559
don't say

1075
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,099
I shouldn't say that the strain oh their

1076
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,858
genetics came from uh Southwest South

1077
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:52,140
Southwestern Ontario I could say that

1078
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:53,819
they most likely came through

1079
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:56,279
and they probably came through

1080
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,800
California to get to BC but again when

1081
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,599
you get strains like Texada Texas at a

1082
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,460
time warp there's certain

1083
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,859
um and I was I found some seed that from

1084
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,500
Gabriola right like

1085
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:12,299
um where they come from I'm sure there's

1086
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:14,880
people on the island that will claim or

1087
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,119
and rightfully so say well Texada came

1088
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,760
from Texada because they came from

1089
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:24,599
California and we took uh we took pollen

1090
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,960
from Ontario or we took pollen from

1091
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,000
[ __ ] you know some seed that we got

1092
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,519
out of Africa you know I used to order

1093
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,079
seeds from [ __ ] Africa back in ham

1094
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:39,420
Nation days like literally from uh uh uh

1095
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,460
seats dealer out of [ __ ] yeah I think I

1096
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,920
don't know if it was South Africa the

1097
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,179
swazi and swazi pepper and there's

1098
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,818
another stream

1099
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:49,199
but uh you know I would use that in my

1100
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:51,420
breeding program

1101
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,939
I'm gonna put that in quotations again I

1102
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,900
would use that when I was making seeds

1103
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,420
and uh

1104
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,119
that made that strain from here right

1105
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,519
did it originate here yes the seed did

1106
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,858
but the genetics that it came from

1107
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:08,338
obviously didn't come from here because

1108
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:10,858
we have very little if any land races as

1109
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:13,739
same as BC has very little to any same

1110
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:16,679
as you know California they might I they

1111
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:18,479
might have a land race there I don't

1112
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:23,578
know of one

1113
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:26,099
right but no no I mean I think I think

1114
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:28,980
most most California breeding if I had

1115
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:32,099
to guess like what the very Inception of

1116
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:34,260
California breeding is it was like how

1117
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:36,119
do we make these sativas that we're

1118
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,040
getting free seeds with these kilos

1119
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,800
we're getting how do we make them finish

1120
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:42,420
in our area yeah oh well I have some

1121
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,099
Mexican and that stuff seems to finish

1122
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,900
earlier so maybe I'll take some of this

1123
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:48,660
Thai or Colombian and I'll cross it to

1124
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,940
Mexican yeah and it was literally very

1125
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:52,980
like very it was very I don't think

1126
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,300
people had goals other than the fact of

1127
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,760
like I need this to finish before

1128
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:00,960
January well I think that's where a lot

1129
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,339
of the you know genetics were built and

1130
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,159
why they were built because I know and

1131
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,960
that's why again going back to the East

1132
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,358
Coast West Coast

1133
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,280
um we had draft Dodgers that [ __ ] ran

1134
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,980
the border and uh and brought their

1135
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,500
genetics up to Southwestern Ontario

1136
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:20,159
again because being so close to Detroit

1137
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,739
so close to uh Buffalo you know the most

1144
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,480
[ __ ] strain and grow it in my house

1145
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:42,719

pounds per light I mean heaven so that's

1152
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:05,219
where I was that's my whole program

1153
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:07,619
that's what it was about when I used the

1154
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:10,199
I used to read Neville's catalogs and

1155
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:12,838
Scentsy and God anything that was in

1156
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:15,480
that 45 to 50 day range just looked

1157
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,519
attractive it did and I just you know I

1158
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,338
I didn't get any I didn't believe any of

1159
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,679
this [ __ ] I really put the [ __ ] uh

1160
00:46:20,338 --> 00:46:25,679
the Amsterdam guys through a lot of [ __ ]

1161
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:28,980
in my years just because I called

1162
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,960
[ __ ] on a lot of them because I grew

1163
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,059
out a lot of their Stranges and I was

1164
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,940
just like this is you know I'm at 60

1165
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:38,940
days I'm not going to argue out of 55 or

1166
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:41,400
60 Day flower right that's fine with me

1167
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,679
inside but you're saying 45 today 45 to

1168
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,358
50 days and like yeah don't know about

1169
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,279
that you know and then give me the

1170
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:50,519
[ __ ] yields I was like yeah don't

1171
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,220
know about that you know like but again

1172
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:55,920
maybe again that's business though they

1173
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:58,739
need to they want to sell that seed and

1174
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:03,180
they want to sell that seed to be

1175
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:05,459
um attractive to the indoor grower or

1176
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:07,679
attracted to the North American grower

1177
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:11,400
who if they are going to grow outdoors

1178
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:15,000
they want it to be done uh in September

1179
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,619
they proceeded to be done by October you

1180
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,679
know I mean when you when you look at

1181
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:22,680
like California history before the

1182
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:25,379
helicopters people were fine with things

1183
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,000
taking into November right no big deal

1184
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,200
when there was no police pressure and

1185
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,179
they weren't worried about their crop

1186
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,799
getting chopped yeah November is fine

1187
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:33,480
all of a sudden you get camp and you get

1188
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,640
all these helicopters in the sky and

1189
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,519
they're like when can I pull down in

1190
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:40,078
September yeah that extra two months is

1191
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:42,480
a real prop three months is an extra

1192
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,240
problem we had snow that we had to worry

1193
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,880
about up here right like the cops the

1194
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,858
cops here go out in August right so the

1195
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,920
Choppers are there in August September

1196
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:56,279
maybe kind of thing right because uh we

1197
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,139
have to be down ideally end of September

1198
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,079
early October if you go anything past

1199
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:02,759
that button rotten stuff like that you

1200
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,680
know we still get the humidity we are

1201
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,839
surrounded by the Great Lakes we get you

1202
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,940
know we get the cold uh the hot days the

1203
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:10,679
cold nights we get Bud rot like you

1204
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,079
wouldn't [ __ ] believe you know I

1205
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,480
believe I I believe it I mean I I think

1206
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,880
as as some of these states like New York

1207
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,338
and New Jersey and and a lot of these

1208
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,720
New England start to open up and what

1209
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:24,480
they want is they want all these

1210
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:26,519
California bread strains yeah I know uh

1211
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,838
because that's what's famous and they

1212
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:29,940
want to sell the name but what they

1213
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:34,139
really should be after is the Canadian

1214
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:37,380
bread stuff well they again but they're

1215
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:40,980
like we were saying before the BC bud is

1216
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:42,059
going to sell the SW Ontario Bud they

1217
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,338
don't know what the [ __ ] does that mean

1218
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:45,719
right even the Quebec nug Quebec Bud

1219
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,460
they're going to say oh I I know of

1220
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:48,899
Quebec they're not going to know of

1221
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,300
Ontario and Ontario is the biggest

1222
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,160
[ __ ] most populated state

1223
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,019
um it definitely by far has the most pop

1224
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,578
growers in it simply because of per

1225
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:58,679
capita the amount of [ __ ] maybe not

1226
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:01,318
per capita but because of the amount of

1227
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:04,440
uh people's population

1228
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:08,639
right but it's um it's going to be a

1229
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:10,559
hard sell to say Canadian Canadian buds

1230
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:14,159
it's all hot they're all going to say BC

1231
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,539
bike right and it's marketing that's uh

1232
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,279
it's what's going to sell it kind of

1233
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:19,739
thing unfortunately or you know

1234
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,019
fortunately whatever to me

1235
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:24,598
I really don't could give any a [ __ ] of

1236
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:27,659
a less honestly but um

1237
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:31,140
you know it is it is hard for

1238
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:32,818
me here trying to sell down into the

1239
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:36,659
states

1240
00:49:32,818 --> 00:49:40,380
unless they they knew me or they knew

1241
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:43,318
the uh genetics I was growing and High

1242
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:46,920
Times their office knew what I was doing

1243
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:47,639
because I used to fly down there with

1244
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,559
um

1245
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:53,338
weighed out eighths and wait out

1246
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:55,440
quarters in glass jars uh

1247
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:57,659
I also what was it it was a 25th

1248
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,599
anniversary party they had Cypress Hill

1249
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:03,480
and Joan Jett and whoever else

1250
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:04,920
um I supplied all the pot to that party

1251
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,460
because

1252
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,858
High Times couldn't really afford let

1253
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,740
alone back then especially the high-end

1254
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:15,420
pot all the super super nice nugs that

1255
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:17,939
you see in that magazine and you see

1256
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,858
Snoop Dogg with a big [ __ ] plate of

1257
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:23,519
buds in front of them and big joints

1258
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:26,699
they rent all that pot they rent it they

1259
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:29,338
rent it rent you can rent weed yeah they

1260
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:31,559
rent weed for the Photoshop for the

1261
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:33,960
photo op and then anything that is

1262
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,358
smoked they're paying four or five six

1263
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:39,000
hundred dollars an ounce so they're just

1264
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:40,500
when they were telling me that uh

1265
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,219
they're like oh [ __ ] man they were all

1266
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:48,000
another [ __ ] big fat [ __ ] uh blunt

1267
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:51,838
that's gonna cost us [ __ ] 300 you

1268
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,159
know what a bunch of clowns yeah I'll do

1269
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:54,779
it well you gotta remember what era it

1270
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:56,460
was though too I mean yeah it was it was

1271
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,740
it was ridiculous

1272
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,619
you know I know Sean was trying to get

1273
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:03,000
us to talk about like our our uh you

1274
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:05,880
know some of our Amsterdam and cup

1275
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,940
experiences because we overlapped but

1276
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:12,960
you know when I would go I went to three

1277
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:17,338
cups in the 90s I think like 95 97 98

1278
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,260
right right and what I experienced was

1279
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:23,099
that like you were just saying all the

1280
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:25,559
best weed was set aside for like the

1281
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,960
celebrities yep and the people that were

1282
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,700
gonna pay top dollar for it and the

1283
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,260
people that wanted to show up and like

1284
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:33,659
they didn't care if they dropped Mad

1285
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:38,280
Coin so it was actually like one of the

1286
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:40,019
worst weeks or months to visit Amsterdam

1287
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,760
yeah because if you were just a normal

1288
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:43,619
person they're like well we have good

1289
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,540
weed but we're gonna sell it for three

1290
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:47,579
times what it's worth yeah because

1291
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:49,079
people pay the North American Tax right

1292
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:50,460
you're gonna pay the North American Tax

1293
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,780
because we have all these celebrities

1294
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,639
coming in and we have all these

1295
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,099
musicians and stuff and these entourages

1296
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:58,379
right we've got all this weed and hash

1297
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:00,539
that aside just for them and we're gonna

1298
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,220
charge them out the nose for it and so

1299
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:04,739
we can't give it to you unless you want

1300
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:07,618
to pay this like exorbitant price yeah

1301
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:09,838
and so it was like it gets ridiculous

1302
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:11,880
and again New York is the same way La

1303
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,699
was the same way New York and L.A

1304
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,559
obviously with the highest markets uh I

1305
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:18,598
think ever any place in the world and

1306
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,460
when High Times used to do like in the

1307
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,200
very back of the pages like the price

1308
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,500
prices from around the world and around

1309
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:27,419
the country and how much a an eighth was

1310
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,219
and how much an ounce was and stuff it

1311
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:32,519
was always La in New York at the [ __ ]

1312
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:35,219
top kind of thing but with with um with

1313
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:38,400
uh with working with high times and

1314
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:41,578
Kyle knew my genetics like I said when

1315
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,039
he was coming here to buy it uh and and

1316
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:46,980
shipping it back to Detroit

1317
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:48,420
I would send uh I would send dogs down

1318
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,818
to him

1319
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,039
um and we had a thing going where I'd

1320
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:55,920
mail it to the High Times office

1321
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:59,300
and then inside I'd be like I hope this

1322
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,818
gets you busted you [ __ ] douchebags

1323
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:05,220
and and putting in all this you know

1324
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:09,000
hate mail with a half pound of pot in it

1325
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:11,939
kind of thing right and uh when the 25th

1326

1335
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:32,098

1349
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,280
freezer bag half pounds of pot other

1350
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,838
than what they wanted for the party

1351
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,319
which was just a few pounds or something

1352
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:12,719
like that but I mailed probably

1353
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,880
at least a pound that was already

1354
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,399
weighed out and in and sealed in glass

1355
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,059
jars with [ __ ] homemade labels on

1356
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,280
every jar and I would uh I would mail

1357
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:25,859
them uh separately

1358
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,440
and then when I got down there I sat in

1359
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:31,500
Steve's office I was either bloomy's

1360
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,300
office or um

1361
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,818
um

1362
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,740
there's one other office anyways I would

1363
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:39,380
just I would sit in their office and

1364
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:41,879
they would come in like one at a time

1365
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,980
and choose I was like and I was like

1366
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,760
listen it's [ __ ]

1367
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,858
um

1368
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,960
I I think I was

1369
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:52,799
stiffing them a little bit I might have

1370
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:56,039
charged 50 bucks an eighth kind of thing

1371
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,680
um because I could and it was like

1372
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:01,079
I was shipping literally jars that were

1373
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:03,960
cured and it was like my my nicest stuff

1374
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,818
I got that's a risk I got to sit on the

1375
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,318
couch with Jack Herrera and I was super

1376
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:10,800
stoked because I was like listen Jack I

1377
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:15,000
want you to uh smoke this um uh golden

1378
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:18,300
Haze it's my strain I bred it but I used

1379
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,699
some genetics that you know with this

1380
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,220
nl5 skunk one that made his that Sensei

1381
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:24,960
used to make his train yeah um I used

1382
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:26,879
some of that

1383
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,659
uh

1384
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,480
uh I used a uh

1385
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:36,179
a version of keeping that kind of blend

1386
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,920
in mind because it was exactly what I

1387
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:40,919
wanted in my stream I wanted like I said

1388
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,740
before a short fat sativa

1389
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,440
giving high from a plant that's going to

1390
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:48,959
finish in less than 60 days and I could

1391
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,139
ruin a [ __ ] uh room with nine foot

1392
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:55,500
ceilings yeah and it was like when he

1393
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:56,879
when he you know tried my my stuff and

1394
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,519
he's like wow that's [ __ ] really nice

1395
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,280
tasty so on so forth

1396
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,739
I it made my [ __ ] it made my career

1397
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:08,040
at that time kind of thing just to get

1398
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:11,338
there and and smoke a joint with them at

1399
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,239
the same time having

1400
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:14,599
um

1401
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:17,759
who's the head of who is a Hagar Hagar

1402
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:19,079
yeah Hager yeah Stephen Hager yeah so I

1403
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,640
would I think I was sitting in his

1404
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:25,019
office actually because he was the head

1405
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:27,960
honcho and uh I was selling [ __ ]

1406
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:30,539
uh quarters and Ace and [ __ ] like that

1407
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,280
pre-jarred up to the entire staff kind

1408
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:34,619
of thing and then the party was you know

1409
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,960
that night and I was just like they paid

1410
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:39,059
me [ __ ] ridiculous amount I mean and

1411
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,338
I took less far less than what they were

1412
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:44,280
offering me because I was kind of

1413
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:46,380
honored one that I can yeah you know

1414
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,720
Supply the pot but I was also making a

1415
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:52,740
shitload of money by selling them my

1416
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:55,739
private uh Growers jar collection kind

1417
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:58,199
of [ __ ] so that's a testament to London

1418
00:56:55,739 --> 00:57:00,779
because like you don't know how hard it

1419
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:03,058
is like being on on the internet and

1420
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,819
talking to weed guys trying to say that

1421
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:10,280
Southwestern Ontario had [ __ ] great

1422
00:57:05,818 --> 00:57:10,279
pot nobody believes it nobody

1423
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:17,279
great pot man all you have is [ __ ]

1424
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:19,980
cities and cornfields but again

1425
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,720
it comes down to population when you

1426
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,960
when you have

1427
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:27,299
10 to 15 times the amount of people

1428
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,639
jammed into a certain area

1429
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:34,019
there's going to be phenomenal

1430
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:37,699
pot growers as well as the

1431
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:39,780
the people that really want to find that

1432
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:41,939
unique strain

1433
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:43,079
and they travel the world maybe not for

1434
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,358
pot

1435
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:47,280
but due to the amount of people

1436
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,679
the population they travel all over the

1437
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,960
world and if they [ __ ] find pot in

1438
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,519
Thailand or North Africa or someplace

1439
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,699
and like oh I got a couple seats I'm

1440
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:58,440
gonna throw in my [ __ ] in my shoe

1441
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:00,179
yeah and it's just because of the amount

1442
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,880
of people that we have coming back here

1443
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:05,519
and again why I would always say that I

1444
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,599
think Southwest Ontario produces some of

1445
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,858
the best

1446
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:13,160
pot growers and genetics

1447
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:15,358
uh passing through

1448
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,818
uh in Canada

1449
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:21,539
a lot of that though is due to community

1450
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:25,679
building because like you know the hemp

1451
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:28,318
Nation thing like when that happened and

1452
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:32,539
you were offering what you did at that

1453
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,539
place a lot of people learned a lot

1454
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:37,439
even it

1455
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,900
literally planted the seed for a lot of

1456
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,220
people right because yeah Chris gave uh

1457
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:47,579
gave people the option to buy their own

1458
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:49,618
seed not take bag weed and find a seed

1459
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:52,140
and not know you know what the [ __ ] it

1460
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:54,059
is we were we were kind of weeding out

1461
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:56,759
some of that we were telling you

1462
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:58,740
uh what it is we will tell you it's

1463
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,319
going to be something within this range

1464
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:03,358
because it is an F1 we just took this

1465
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:06,119
Scentsy seed and we took this greenhouse

1466
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,960
seed and we grew them and this is what

1467
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,240
we got

1468
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,740
and the mother was this and the dad was

1469
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:12,358
this and this is what they looked like

1470
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:15,899
and that's when they finished and and so

1471
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:17,818
on so we gave him an educated guess but

1472
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,338
it was literally planting the seed of

1473
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:22,558
people uh when I started that uh grow

1474
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:25,139
your tuition campaign in in London here

1475
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,140
just for all the students right giving

1476
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:31,078
them discounts I had a coupon on a flyer

1477
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:33,900
that gave them a discount on grow guides

1478
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,980
and uh and then like I said uh

1479
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,500
information the best thing about

1480
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,179
information is it's free if you uh

1481
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,880
wanted to come down on the Sundays and

1482
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:43,379
we have cultivation talks you know I

1483
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,460
didn't mind sharing that I [ __ ] love

1484
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,099
talking about that's what we're doing

1485
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:49,199
right now right like yeah we were doing

1486
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:50,838
this back in the mid 80s I mean 90s kind

1487
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:54,838
of thing

1488
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:58,380
it's actually really hard for me

1489
00:59:54,838 --> 01:00:00,900
to tell people today with like what

1490
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:03,480
we're doing right now and all the forums

1491
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:07,260
and IG and all the ways that people can

1492
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,460
connect how tough it was to get

1493
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:13,020
information

1494
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:15,420
how how small groups used to be how rare

1495
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:17,159
it was to find people that like knew

1496
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,599
what they were doing

1497
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:20,940
um and then the other thing is like I

1498
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:23,519
always I'd still consider like 90s to be

1499
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:26,159
like the Golden Era of weed

1500
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:29,159
um just in the sense because

1501
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:32,039
basically any like weed was rare enough

1502
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:34,500
that it could take too long it could not

1503
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:36,659
look that great as long as it worked

1504
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,818
really well yeah it was going to gain

1505
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:40,679
popularity you know because there was

1506
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:42,838
there was only so much of it so like a

1507
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:45,779
lot of the famous strains in the 90s

1508
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:47,880
Rose to the top because they were really

1509
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,019
good yeah you know yeah and they didn't

1510
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,358
really have

1511
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:52,679
I think a lot of people nowadays you

1512
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:55,259
know

1513
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:56,759
um the placebo effect comes into play a

1514
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,140
lot with all these new genetics sure

1515
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,460
there's a lot of fire out there but

1516
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:01,980
there's people that are just like oh

1517
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:03,720
well this is this strain right oh this

1518
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:06,539
is a Kush oh well and it has the smell

1519
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:09,358
of a Kush but it has uh you know it

1520
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:11,880
doesn't really rock you like some of the

1521
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,798
other yeah but since it since it you

1522
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,500
know smells like it looks like it [ __ ]

1523
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:17,818
it must [ __ ] be the close enough and

1524
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,798

01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:55,679
same thing and I was infamous with my

1540

organic traveler crew like all the the

1541
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,159
you know glass blowers that were

1542
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:02,280
downstairs and all this I thought they

1543
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:03,539
were these these pot snobs and they'd be

1544
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,460

1571
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:05,339
start trying this this strain I was like

1572
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:07,440
[ __ ] you dude that's the goddamn what's

1573
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:09,480
that we [ __ ] you smoke [ __ ] two

1574
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,420
weeks ago you said with [ __ ] you know

1575
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,920
it's tasty butt on it and now none of

1576
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:15,720
those guys would [ __ ] trust me to

1577
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,700
give him any [ __ ] pot I know oh [ __ ]

1578
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:19,618
no yeah you ruined that [ __ ] you man

1579
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:21,779
that's [ __ ] tasty bud and I was like

1580
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:24,780
no it's actually not kind of thing but

1581
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,700
so yeah we've been accused of using that

1582
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,480
on uh some of the blueberry stuff we put

1583
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:30,000
out

1584
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,798
the tasty Bud stuff like when people

1585
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,579
smell like good blueberry stuff yeah

1586
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:37,380
this is a syrup I think a lot of people

1587
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:40,559
you know

1588
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:42,240
um and if you smell my B-93 like it

1589
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:45,000
doesn't it smells like

1590
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,759
uh not the blueberry smell but it smells

1591
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,318
like a a pint of actual blueberries

1592
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,740
right you don't have to see a little bit

1593
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:54,480
more that that sweet earthy Aroma kind

1594
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:56,459
of thing and again it's from it's from

1595
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,679
93. that's when we started the seed

1596
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:02,039
right like it's an it's an old [ __ ]

1597
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:04,618
plant kind of yeah I got them I'm going

1598
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:06,420
back to that that era and it would have

1599
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:08,780
been

1600
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:12,720
I would I would have got them indirectly

1601
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:15,420
uh okay or basically it was when he was

1602
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:17,279
first releasing his blueberries if I

1603
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,838
remember correctly I mean Tony could

1604
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,099
have had it earlier don't get me wrong

1605
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:24,779
but I think that Tony had with Simon and

1606
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:28,619
they had cerebral

1607
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:31,559
in 94. right and then they split and

1608
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:33,420
Tony made sag Martha and Simon made

1609
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:36,540
serious yeah

1610
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:40,740
you know I think Dan I think DJ Short

1611
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:43,139
was with um Tony with Tony and uh they

1612
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:45,298
did the bubble gum and they called it 94

1613
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:47,519
blueberry if I remember correctly yeah

1614
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:49,259
he worked with Tony he sold it through

1615
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:50,880
Tony first and then they had some

1616
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:54,480
falling out and then I think he moved to

1617
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,858
Dutch Passion yes yeah he got angry at

1618
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,219
all of them and then he and then he

1619
01:04:55,858 --> 01:05:00,420
moved it to Canada yeah yeah yeah yeah

1620
01:04:58,219 --> 01:05:01,858
and that's the thing is and this is

1621
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:07,980
where

1622
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:10,019
um he met up with Steve and red and I'll

1623
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,719
call him the air mechanic because I

1624
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:14,159
don't know of a nickname for him but uh

1625
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,139
he was uh

1626
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,480
great grower

1627
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:20,759
um didn't do anything huge like 12

1628
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,139
lights or something but I I not if I'm

1629
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,480
not mistaken again red would be the

1630
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:26,400
better uh

1631
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,318
uh information on the background on this

1632
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,639
but I believe they bred the blue

1633
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:32,159
satellite

1634
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:34,739
okay I know they were doing a grow out

1635
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,940
for DJ and

1636
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:38,279
um

1637
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:41,159
but that was a little bit later so I the

1638
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,480
seed that I got was just before that and

1639
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:44,699
that's where I was thinking that it

1640
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,460
might have came indirectly

1641
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:49,739
from DJ

1642
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:52,318
um but it would have been like I thought

1643
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:54,058
it would I know it was 93 but I thought

1644
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:57,179
it was actually from him and not from

1645
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:59,160
from Tony from is it is it a clone

1646
01:05:57,179 --> 01:06:00,539
that's still alive yeah

1647
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:01,259
oh

1648
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:05,099
um

1649
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:08,220
I literally just killed off like six 75

1650
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:11,220
to 80 of my genetics yeah guys I'm just

1651
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:13,500
I'm retiring I'm tired really frustrated

1652
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:15,779
I was actually there today trying to

1653
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:18,920
salvage what

1654
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:21,240
um one of my staff

1655
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,858
from the center he's like if you can

1656
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:25,739
save me all these strains I'll find

1657
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:28,380
somebody to grow to to babysit them for

1658
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:31,199
you until you get over this divorce [ __ ]

1659
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:34,380
and if I wanted to go into it like

1660
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:36,980
out of the hundred and

1661
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:40,559
twenty three

1662
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:44,119
123 strains that I had

1663
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:48,599
I had data collected on their use

1664
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:51,599
medical uses through the compassion uh

1665
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:55,440
Center going back almost 15 years yeah

1666
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,760
so because in Canada we cannot say well

1667
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,619
this strain works for this medical

1668
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:02,940
condition sure

1669
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:07,019
um what I could do is saying out of the

1670
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:09,539
30 people that suffer from Ms this is

1671
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:11,579
their the top selling Indica this is the

1672
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:14,220
top selling sativa I think that's

1673
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:17,280
responsible actually and it would just

1674
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:19,879
be basically giving them

1675
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:23,280
um well it's data

1676
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,079
let's say again it's data to use I mean

1677
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,640
yeah

1678
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,619
like literally for almost 15 years I've

1679
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:30,900
collected this that's the most important

1680
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:34,440
[ __ ] I had it all [ __ ] ready and

1681
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:37,019
packaged to go into the LPS up here and

1682
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:40,858
I just [ __ ] saw the dark side of the

1683
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:42,659
[ __ ] industry that was just chewing

1684
01:07:40,858 --> 01:07:44,940
and spitting out anybody from the

1685
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:46,379
movement yeah and I took a lot of heat

1686
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,539
from people I think we talked about this

1687
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,980
last time from you know people in the

1688
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:52,799
movement that thought I sold out by

1689
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:55,858
going to um uh

1690
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:57,960
uh into the lb LLP

1691
01:07:55,858 --> 01:08:00,119
um legal I mean it's crazy because it's

1692
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,619
what you've been working for your entire

1693
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:03,599
life you know yeah it's like [ __ ] it

1694
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,858
like that's [ __ ] crazy you can't

1695
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,019
[ __ ] steer the boat if you're

1696
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:09,058
standing on the shore [ __ ] yelling

1697
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:10,739
like get on the phone well I mean as

1698
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,180
like in the best Direction you can and

1699
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:15,719
that's what I was doing with my genetics

1700
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:19,500
I was like I can't I'm again

1701
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:22,679
strange names or names to me because I'm

1702
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,939
I'm out for the medical benefits of it I

1703
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:25,020
don't give a [ __ ] what you call it and

1704
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:26,278
that's going to come back to the dog

1705
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:28,920
[ __ ]

1706
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:30,839
um where it doesn't it didn't really

1707
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,060
make a difference now I had a I had a

1708
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:35,899
strain that called warm diarrhea right

1709
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:39,539
oh okay wise

1710
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:41,879
really marketable yeah you know it was

1711
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:42,719
this one strain didn't produce what the

1712
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,480
[ __ ]

1713
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:48,600
but holy God Jesus did it ever smell

1714
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:51,599
like dog [ __ ] [ __ ] warm diarrhea like

1715
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:54,440
hot summer time [ __ ] diarrhea

1716
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,838
squirted like kind of smell yeah

1717
01:08:54,439 --> 01:09:00,838
I know it phenomenal

1718
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:02,880
it's like so I called it that I was like

1719
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:04,920
I don't I don't know what it is it's a

1720
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,679
[ __ ] clone that I went to I was

1721
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:09,420
Consulting a guy's Garden he [ __ ]

1722
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,980
said these of my strains I said where

1723
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:12,539
are they from he's like I [ __ ] you know

1724
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:14,218
my brother-in-law gave me some of this

1725
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:17,399
and some of that and I found some seed

1726
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:20,338
and this and that and this one [ __ ]

1727
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:22,439
the one plant was like holy God Jesus

1728
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:24,119
that's nasty I Gotta Have It kind of

1729
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:26,159
thing and um

1730
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:29,399
you know with uh with Sam when he was

1731
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:32,159
doing his skunk and um everybody was

1732
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:33,119
like oh it's you know yeah that that and

1733
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:34,619
I was just having this conversation

1734
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:38,338
today actually with my cousin because

1735
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:42,059
he's like I had a skunk one back when uh

1736
01:09:38,338 --> 01:09:44,039
back when uh Tilly was [ __ ] growing

1737
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,359
for the center right and I'll find the

1738
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:47,819
picture because it made it was a full

1739
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,798
page picture in high times and it's this

1740
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:52,620
kid holding one of the nugs up and he's

1741
01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:54,960
holding his forearm and the nug is twice

1742
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:58,198
the size of this kid's Forum oh wow that

1743
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:01,198
was my skunk one and it's you know you

1744
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:02,939
grow the true skunk one I I believe is

1745
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,219
mainly grown for structure more than

1746
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:06,119
that skunky smell if I'm not mistaken I

1747
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:08,819
think

1748
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:11,039
Sammy was actually trying to get rid of

1749
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:13,799
and I think I was that's his claim yeah

1750
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:16,920
you guys covered this you don't you

1751
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:20,219
don't follow like modern IG culture and

1752
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:23,520
stuff but like there's been a massive

1753
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:28,279
massive movement on finding roadkill

1754
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,280
skunk which everyone because I was gonna

1755
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:34,380
out west today

1756
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:37,440
this guy and I don't know his [ __ ]

1757
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:40,560
name I'll find out but he sent one of my

1758
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:43,738
uh Sasquatch the kid that works away uh

1759
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,480
who's like the Cannabis connoisseur he

1760
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:49,319
ended up getting

1761
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:51,658
um this [ __ ] jar of skunk one I

1762
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:54,779
opened it up and I was like holy [ __ ]

1763
01:10:51,658 --> 01:10:56,819
that's my skunk one it smells like and I

1764
01:10:54,779 --> 01:10:58,380
called it roadkill skunk one I didn't

1765
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:00,179
know that was a name called roadkill I

1766
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,039
was yeah yeah it's not a strain though

1767
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:03,658
it's just it's just a reference to a

1768
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:06,359
type of expression that can come from

1769
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:09,299
afghanis or skunky plants okay well this

1770
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:12,299
uh this skunk one grew

1771
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:13,980
the the structure and the and my cousin

1772
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,920
just said listen if you get it I want to

1773
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:17,579
breed with it because

1774
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,560
um

1775
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:22,439
it has

1776
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:25,320
the if it's the same cut that this guy's

1777
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:27,178
sending me I it smells the same the nug

1778
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:28,139
looks the same I have to find out if the

1779
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:30,658
structure is the same because the

1780
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:33,179
structure was what the the skunk one was

1781
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:36,238
all about like yeah I have that big nug

1782
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:37,199
that [ __ ] can hold itself and

1783
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:40,019
um

1784
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,879
like I said this uh Tilly kid that was

1785
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,980
um growing and we're doing on an ebb and

1786
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,779
flow cable and they were just spikes

1787
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:50,158
they were just these big beautiful

1788
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:51,779
[ __ ] fragrant roadkill smell uh

1789
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:55,259
skunk one

1790
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:57,420
so you know and I think I was I lit I

1791
01:11:55,260 --> 01:12:00,119
try to put some of your guys podcasts on

1792
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:02,640
I don't listen to podcasts so in all

1793
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:04,079
honesty the first and only podcast I

1794
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,820
really listened to was like three nights

1795
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:09,679
ago when it was while I was going to bed

1796
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:12,658
and I wanted to hear what we did yeah

1797
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:15,119
and uh something else came up and you

1798
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:17,099
guys were talking about Sam's reading

1799
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:20,340
trying to breed out the skunk one the

1800
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:22,320
skunk yeah you know actually and uh and

1801
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,719
uh focusing on structure and I was like

1802
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,658
that's ironic because that's what I

1803
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:31,319
wanted but I was also chasing that

1804
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:35,039
um that super skunk kind of uh Aroma

1805
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:37,559
yeah and it was this roadkill like Yeah

1806
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:39,600
because it doesn't smell like skunk when

1807
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,000
you spray it that tarry kind of burnt

1808
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,440
[ __ ] stuff it had that [ __ ] you

1809
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,658
driving down the [ __ ] road and you're

1810
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:48,299
like holy [ __ ] yeah you know that's

1811
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:49,920
skunk you know yeah it adds that smell

1812
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,560
to it so

1813
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:55,199
um maybe I remember that from like

1814
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:58,199
London I definitely remember skunky

1815
01:12:55,198 --> 01:13:00,839
smells and like I I I kind of related to

1816
01:12:58,198 --> 01:13:04,319
like the Heineken skunky beer smell more

1817
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,940
than animal smell right I have a

1818
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:08,880
question for you Sean this is totally

1819
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:12,839
off topic yeah does Canada get green

1820
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:15,179
Heineken bottles or brown greens not so

1821
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:17,940
yeah great no okay so check it out right

1822
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:22,140
so you can say Jesus Christ but I go to

1823
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:25,500
Holland in the 90s and they have the

1824
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:27,659
Heineken Brewery right is like was again

1825
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,698
it moved now like but it was in

1826
01:13:27,658 --> 01:13:33,839
Amsterdam and they gave tours you know

1827
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:36,839
and so if you buy a Heineken in Holland

1828
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:39,360
it's in a brown bottle right and you

1829
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,520
talked you talked to like the the Dutch

1830
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:43,079
about it and I'm like well why why is it

1831
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,580
in a green bottle in America and they're

1832
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:46,380
like oh cause you guys are dumb but it's

1833
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:48,479
iconic over there so you want the green

1834
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,940
bottle but it oxidizes so it makes the

1835
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,500
beer go skunky and [ __ ] yeah yeah and if

1836
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:54,839
you get it in Europe it's a dark brown

1837
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:58,500
bottle okay because we don't want the

1838
01:13:54,840 --> 01:14:01,219
light to [ __ ] it up but that tastes the

1839
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,219
cost of taste

1840
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:07,619
skunky beer yeah so it's like and he's

1841
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,020
like you buy a Heineken anywhere in

1842
01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:12,000
Europe it's in a brown bottle you go to

1843
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,520
the USA it's in a green bottle and he's

1844
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,520
like it's just advertising we have we

1845
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:20,280
have two we had two beers that were like

1846
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,600
the pot beers and it was Heineken and

1847
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:23,779
Moosehead

1848
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,880
and Moosehead was also in a green box

1849
01:14:23,779 --> 01:14:30,119
you know but they both had that very

1850
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,400
skunky skunky like to get a six-pack and

1851
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:34,679
and some weed and smoke weed and smoke

1852
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:36,179
like and drink Moosehead was like that

1853
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:38,520
was the thing you know that was like

1854
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:41,179
they paired you know you guys are so

1855
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,920
Canadian bro yeah I

1856
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:46,219
haven't drank beer and

1857
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,560
like 20 years

1858
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:51,300
I I just I you know I just had to throw

1859
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,739
it out there because I was like shocked

1860
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,960
when they literally were like oh we only

1861
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,519
do that to the dumb Americans right

1862
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,719
that's like legit what they said you

1863
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,480
know and so I was like oh I guess that

1864
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:02,579
includes Canadians but yeah um what's

1865
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:06,178
funny about what's funny about the skunk

1866
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:08,939
you know uh is that like we're all so

1867
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:10,260
old now right there was this thing that

1868
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:11,819
tripped me out because you don't feel

1869
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,739
old in your head even though when you're

1870
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:17,099
getting old where I saw this thing where

1871
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:20,039
like the 90s are as far away now as the

1872
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:23,719
60s were in the 90s yeah

1873
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:26,519
right and so there's all these smokers

1874
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:28,079
that like they all the stuff we're

1875
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:30,239
talking about all this stuff that's like

1876
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,920
our youth you know and you know in our

1877
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:34,559
20s and everything else that was so

1878
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,460
common this is all legendary just words

1879
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,920
now

1880
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,899
the reason why they're hunting that

1881
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,819
skunk is because it's gone away and

1882
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:43,319
while it was super common in the 90s and

1883
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:46,439
there was lots of weed that was very

1884
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:48,539
skunky or had skunk type Terps

1885
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:51,479
it's kind of gone away

1886
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:53,519
you know and so now it's like you know

1887
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:55,979
we were talking about how BC Bud Rhymes

1888
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,199
or whatever but like Northern all these

1889
01:15:55,979 --> 01:16:00,899
strains are coming back again and they

1890
01:15:58,198 --> 01:16:01,979
don't even have to be the actual strain

1891
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:04,559
anymore

1892
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:07,379
it just has to have the name yeah

1893
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:10,500
because the name is what survived the

1894
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:12,239
population the users are so young that

1895
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,560
they won't know the difference they

1896
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:17,459
don't know they weren't they were

1897
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:19,800
smoking the NL back in the day

1898
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:22,619
um they're not smoking pot anymore kind

1899
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,659
of thing right so bark this down you

1900
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:26,760
know like the big the big screen back in

1901
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:29,579
my day was like the nl5 skunk one right

1902
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,679
like yeah that was the go-to that was if

1903
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:34,679
you know the center of the road easy to

1904
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:37,560
grow big yield depending on what

1905
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:39,600
phenotype you got you know it kind of

1906
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,520
was the best of all worlds and it was

1907
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,460
again it was an easy grower kind of

1908
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,739
thing but uh you know to find anything

1909
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:50,340
like that I think like pot now is so

1910
01:16:46,738 --> 01:16:53,539
bastardized yeah I agree it's it's not

1911
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:56,819
as simple you know and sure

1912
01:16:53,539 --> 01:16:59,399
my Matt well I did have another question

1913
01:16:56,819 --> 01:17:04,619
we were talking about the triple SC last

1914
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:06,899
time yeah yeah right and so do you have

1915
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:09,840

United States ever now what now work

1929
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:46,679
with I'm just saying thinking that after

1930
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,100
they were there

1931
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:53,760
that they move that after maybe some of

1932
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:55,500
their colleagues staff or something I

1933
01:17:53,760 --> 01:18:00,840
want to find out about the Golden Boy

1934
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:04,760
because the way I what I was told was

1935
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:08,460
that this strain came from

1936
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:11,300
Ontario and I I wouldn't say maybe like

1937
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:16,980
more up Central north of Southwestern

1938
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:20,760
Ontario but it came from the triple SC

1939
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:22,619
or somebody from that group that is now

1940
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,020
living in Canada and we're going back to

1941
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:27,840
like like SSC didn't have a strain

1942
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:31,980
called Golden Boy either

1943
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,840
they had they had like M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 m6

1944
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:35,579
and then they have they'd have little

1945
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,440
names after but it'd be like Nigerian

1946
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:42,119
Kandahar or skunk one or uh

1947
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:44,819
basic five it was very very basic

1948
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:47,519
there's Williams Wonder small names like

1949
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:50,579
that no Golden Boy though

1950
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:53,040
can you ask them though like yeah if you

1951
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:58,260
can reach out just ask them because the

1952
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:59,479
story that I had was it came from

1953
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:03,600
from

1954
01:18:59,479 --> 01:19:06,658
their group and I believe it was bred by

1955
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,760
them and it might have had like an M24

1956
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:09,839
or something yeah yeah

1957
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,360
um

1958
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:16,319
but and it was a it was a 45-day

1959
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:18,658
finishing plant and that's what was so

1960
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,158
was a [ __ ] crazy wasn't the best

1961
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:22,859
yield or it was a really weird looking

1962
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:26,939
plant but it was 45 days was it an

1963
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:28,920
indica or sativa it was I I would say it

1964
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:30,238
would have leaned I would say I wouldn't

1965
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:32,100
even say it would leaned either way I

1966
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:35,399
would have to look at some of the the

1967
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,960
pictures that's so fast that I think I

1968
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:38,519
even have

1969
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,380
I might have the picture that's like

1970
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,179
Mighty might fast isn't it dude it was

1971
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:46,560
super fast it was ridiculously fast it

1972
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:48,600
wasn't a great strain on its own but it

1973
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,340
was great for breeding yeah and that's

1974
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,380
what I again made the and why it's what

1975
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:54,360
it's called Golden Haze

1976
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:56,400
um because there was other things and it

1977
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:59,759
was chemo and

1978
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:00,539
um uh uh skunk in it

1979
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,940
um

1980
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:05,880
and uh we crossed it with the golden boy

1981
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:08,099
because I wanted to speed it up but my

1982
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,679
my

1983
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:14,760
um what I was looking for was a fast

1984
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:20,940
growing short fat sativa yeah right so

1985
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:23,659
the um the haze it was a uh uh

1986
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:25,738
Early Skunk

1987
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:29,879
uh chemo

1988
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:31,738
crossed with the haze and then we

1989
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,079
crossed it with the Golden Boy to speed

1990
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:35,698
it up

1991
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:39,600
yeah you know see all over the place I

1992
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:41,698
just I found one that seemed to fit the

1993
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,980
uh the mold I was looking for

1994
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:48,119
and uh I just caught I didn't have a

1995
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:50,879
seat of it I just had a uh a cutting of

1996
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:53,760
it yeah and then we did breed it with

1997
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,679
some other strains my buddy skifa

1998
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,940
um who unfortunately has passed away but

1999
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:00,779
he uh

2000
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:02,939
he crossed it with something blue string

2001
01:21:00,779 --> 01:21:04,439
maybe it was even like blue sky got to

2002
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:06,419
look it up I might still have some of

2003
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:08,819
those seeds too but I just wanted to

2004
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:10,980
find the lineage of that Golden Boy

2005
01:21:08,819 --> 01:21:13,139
because

2006
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:18,359
um I was told it came from the triple s

2007
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:20,340
c boys early 90s maybe mid 90s so they

2008
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:21,960
were done by then yeah they were done

2009
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:25,199
that's what I mean yeah yeah they were

2010
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:27,899
long gone by then um I'm thinking if it

2011
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:31,139
was Offspring from them yes and even

2012
01:21:27,899 --> 01:21:34,559
being off literally Offspring for kids

2013
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:37,920
of theirs or something like that moved

2014
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,920
to Ontario

2015
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,899
yeah I wonder I wonder if his son moved

2016
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,760
out there because his son took over the

2017
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:47,279
company eventually yeah he's the one who

2018
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:51,600
runs it now yeah yeah and then again

2019
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:54,479
this wasn't anybody that um

2020
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,640
I knew it was yeah sure that was a story

2021
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:58,139
that was brought to me and like I said

2022
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,579
the strain was a really unique stream

2023
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:01,500
but it was super fast and I was like

2024
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:04,079
[ __ ] we need it was going to be a

2025
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,640
breeding staple for us until we grew it

2026
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,100
out and we're just like yeah this plant

2027
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,679
is [ __ ] up look any kind of [ __ ] did

2028
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,420
you really weird [ __ ] did you like c99

2029
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:14,579
at all since you were looking for plants

2030
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,440
that were fast hazy uh I'm growing I

2031
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:19,679
haven't seen 99 right now

2032
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:22,698
uh came from this guy tank out of

2033
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:22,699
Toronto area

2034
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:29,880
um I

2035
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:31,039
did grow I'd have to look at my notes

2036
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,119
um

2037
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:35,340
it just tends to be one of those ones

2038
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:38,939
that speaks super fast it didn't stand

2039
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:41,819
out as the you know 45 day okay it might

2040
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:44,339
have been like a 55 day a lot of the

2041
01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:48,960
stuff we do was like 56 day kind of

2042
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:50,760
stuff because we had 50 lights and I

2043
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,960
needed to produce I needed things to

2044
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:54,179
grow

2045
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:57,179
and finish all around the same time yeah

2046
01:22:54,179 --> 01:23:00,119
kind of name for the summer and uh we

2047
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:02,340
did we did do the Cindy 99 it did have a

2048
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:05,158
um uh

yeah Andre Grossman yeah somebody

2054
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,100
commented yeah I thought it was gonna be

2055
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:18,600
male frame I think did I

2056
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,860
did I send you a notes I was like oh

2057

yeah

2058
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:25,920
but uh yeah Audrey Grossman [ __ ] I love

2059
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,360
that guy he was a phenomenal [ __ ]

2060
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,039
phenomenal him and there was another

2061
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,738
photographer at Amsterdam called himself

2062
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:36,960
Yap he he did like the first really

2063
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:39,599
micro trichrome photography oh okay and

2064
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:42,840
uh he yeah he shot through a microphone

2065
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,820
a microscope and uh he did some pretty

2066
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,860
interesting uh photography he was like

2067
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:49,500
one of the he was the first I think that

2068
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:52,259
did micro photography on cannabis but uh

2069
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:55,800
Grossman uh

2070
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:57,480
really nice guy uh super talented he's

2071
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:00,119
the one that shot uh Kyle's Special

2072
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:03,479
Blend poster yeah you know

2073
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:05,939
um and uh I lost track of him

2074
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:07,859
um I should try to find him I know I'd

2075
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:11,479
like to talk to him last time I spoke to

2076
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:15,839
him I believe was right after 9 11

2077
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:17,939
and I called him I was trying to find

2078
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,159
him in more of a panic because being a

2079
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:22,259
photographer myself if he was in the

2080
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:24,179
city he would be the type of guy that's

2081
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:27,360
running towards the [ __ ] buildings

2082
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:29,819
yeah photos before they came down kind

2083
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:32,099
of thing so I was kind of concerned

2084
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:35,279
about uh about that but yeah anyways

2085
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:39,900
yeah we did a few uh I would say shoots

2086
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:43,198
together because he was well well more

2087
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:46,738
established than I was

2088
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:48,178
um but he did help me because I would I

2089
01:24:46,738 --> 01:24:50,579
would find out through him what he was

2090
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:52,140
getting paid and I said well like if

2091
01:24:50,579 --> 01:24:54,238
you're going to use the centerfold for

2092
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:56,640
me I want to get paid the same or so

2093
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:59,519
close kind of [ __ ] right yeah well back

2094
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:02,460
then like you did did you do school for

2095
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,840
photography yeah yeah I started uh

2096
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,840
I did a three-year program here in

2097
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:09,960
London okay so like but you were like

2098
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,699
early early cannabis photographer right

2099
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:13,079
how many photographers were around back

2100
01:25:11,698 --> 01:25:16,439
then

2101
01:25:13,079 --> 01:25:17,779
yeah there wasn't very many of us like

2102
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:21,419
um

2103
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:25,738
I was Andre and I both were listed as

2104
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:28,020
contributing photographers uh in the

2105
01:25:25,738 --> 01:25:32,339
um inside cover

2106
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:35,460
right but he ended up getting lots of a

2107
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:36,900
lot more Centerfolds uh covers and stuff

2108
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,679
like that

2109
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:39,658
um

2110
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:42,119
and uh

2111
01:25:39,658 --> 01:25:43,439
and yeah I don't I think he might have

2112
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:45,300
went to school I'm actually I just met

2113
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:47,939
with fanchon we're gonna I'm gonna put

2114
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:52,140
together a scholarship in my name

2115
01:25:47,939 --> 01:25:53,759
ironically for uh the program because I

2116
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,679
want to um

2117
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:58,320
uh

2118
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:01,139

2123
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:11,819
jail for it and [ __ ] like that I think

2124
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:13,979
make a story for a scholarship but uh

2125
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:16,380
well like yeah cool in the last episode

2126
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:19,198
you mentioned like when you were at the

2127
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:21,239
border you had 10 000 negatives like ten

2128
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:23,099
thousand that's a lot of photos man oh

2129
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:25,319
dude I had boxes and bought and I just

2130
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,159
found uh

2131
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:28,679
um

2132
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:30,420
I'd love to have you scan some of these

2133
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:31,980
like that did you have you ever thought

2134
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:34,100
about doing a book

2135
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:36,539
no no

2136
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:38,280
did you keep track of the strains in

2137
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:41,279
these pictures like did you write on it

2138
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:45,139
what strength what I used to do

2139
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,139
um is I would take a picture

2140
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:50,339
um of the plant and then I take a a

2141
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:52,860
piece of paper and I'd write what the

2142
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:55,560
strain was and put it in the picture and

2143
01:26:52,859 --> 01:26:59,579
then I would do a shoot of that train

2144
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:03,719
yeah most Ops and and uh full plant

2145
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:05,819
shots and stuff like that and then um if

2146
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:07,619
I if I liked it enough for and I thought

2147
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:10,619
High Times would like it I would shoot

2148
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:13,019
it on a positive on a slide yeah because

2149
01:27:10,619 --> 01:27:17,039
we had better uh color saturation and it

2150
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:18,659
was better for them to uh and then uh a

2151
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:22,198
lot of the times I would bring out my

2152
01:27:18,658 --> 01:27:24,779
old Super 8 video camera and videotape

2153
01:27:22,198 --> 01:27:27,419
what I was doing in the garden just so I

2154
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:31,198
would have reference uh because I was

2155
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:34,500
doing it for information for myself on

2156
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:37,559
different genetics as well as for for

2157
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,179
High Times and for future you know

2158
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,380
I mean that's going to be super

2159
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:42,359
important like I don't know if you

2160
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:44,340
understand that but because it because

2161
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:46,079
so much has changed and so many things

2162
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,819
have been renamed over the years it was

2163
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:50,100
a really prime time during those years

2164
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:52,259
to get Point like when you say like

2165
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:54,239
point of origin for like land race stuff

2166
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:56,880
this is like point of origin for a lot

2167
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:59,099
of these strains like in their natural

2168
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:01,859
habitat like getting pictures of let's

2169
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:04,380
say Romulan in Canada during this era

2170
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,519
that's very special we don't have a lot

2171
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,079
of pictures and things like that anymore

2172
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,420
when I was up there's a string called

2173
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:11,939
Biker Bob which was a big yeah I've

2174
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:13,920
heard of that out in California in BC

2175
01:28:11,939 --> 01:28:16,319
for a while there

2176
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,119
um who has set up that I know I I did

2177
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:18,960
this shoot

2178
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:21,599
um

2179
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,460
with High Times in mind I think red set

2180
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:26,699
it up

2181
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:29,579
well maybe Mark uh no I don't think Mark

2182
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:32,460
said it somebody set it up but like it

2183
01:28:29,579 --> 01:28:34,319
was up in north of Whistler and

2184
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:36,239
um I used to blindfold myself on all

2185
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,439
these photo shoots I wouldn't go to a

2186
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,559
photo shoot especially if I didn't know

2187
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:42,479
the people yeah when blindfolded I was

2188
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,520
not smart you'd never be blamed or

2189
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:46,079
anything yeah I would just wear

2190
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:48,239
sunglasses and I would tape the inside

2191
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:49,738
of sunglasses even if they said I didn't

2192
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:51,178
have to do that they're like dude we

2193
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:53,218
know who you don't want to pop up on

2194
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:55,139
that radar ever somewhere it's just like

2195
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:57,300
you know what dude you have a list of

2196
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:59,340
and on that list is everybody that knows

2197
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:00,719
about your garden yep I don't want to be

2198
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:02,579
on that [ __ ] list if something goes

2199
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,340
south I don't want to be on that list

2200
01:29:02,579 --> 01:29:07,679
kind of that's smart yeah and uh we

2201
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:10,139
ended up in some really [ __ ] up

2202
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:11,940
back [ __ ] area countries you know good

2203
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:13,079
old boys million dollar [ __ ] grows

2204
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:15,719
I'm sure

2205
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:18,960
um when I was working in the interior we

2206
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:20,760
ended up going to wine and definitely ha

2207

or something like that but super nice

2208
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:26,880
[ __ ] guy and uh ironically his he

2209
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:28,738
blew his [ __ ] Transformer on the pole

2210
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,659
when I was there

2211
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:32,459
sparks flying everywhere [ __ ] like

2212
01:29:30,658 --> 01:29:34,619
all the lights going off his entire

2213
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:37,139
[ __ ] cruise I met this guy this day

2214
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:41,279
uh it's when I was working on that uh

2215
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:43,199
greenhouse and um his entire [ __ ]

2216
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:45,658
crew [ __ ] bailed everybody [ __ ]

2217
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:47,719
ran because they knew [ __ ] Hydra was

2218
01:29:45,658 --> 01:29:51,479
coming right like oh yeah

2219
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:54,779
you know it's on fire kind of [ __ ] and

2220
01:29:51,479 --> 01:29:56,459
I'm so used to being the guy that you

2221
01:29:54,779 --> 01:29:57,599
know back in the nation days I'm the one

2222
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,980
that had the pickup truck with the

2223
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,420
topper on it that could fit all the pot

2224
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:02,158
plants and everything in the back yeah

2225
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:04,139
yeah you know I'm not scared of the

2226
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:05,579
[ __ ] cops I mean I think I can outrun

2227
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:08,159
a lot of the cops especially back yeah

2228
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:09,899
so I was just like [ __ ] what are we

2229
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:11,579
doing what are you like how yeah what do

2230
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:12,658
you need to grab let's go you know and

2231
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:14,100
use those things but we need to take

2232
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:15,658
this down we need to shut this door we

2233
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,460
need to screw this we need to do this

2234
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:18,839
and I was just like [ __ ] right we

2235
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:21,119
were there for

2236
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,219
couple hours maybe before the hydro

2237
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:25,260
people showed up you know because it was

2238
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:27,000
all I think I think he put up his own

2239
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:28,920
[ __ ] Transformer on a pole or

2240
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,420
something and and it blew their

2241
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,300
Transformer or something so he was

2242
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:35,639
definitely like [ __ ] he's fine but

2243
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:37,920
you know we were just like

2244
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:38,819
we're here to [ __ ] hell I was like I

2245
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,639
don't want to know what your [ __ ]

2246
01:30:38,819 --> 01:30:43,439
Garden is I you know so I'm blindfolded

2247
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:45,840
when I get here I'm blindfolded when I

2248
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:47,819
leave but while I'm here I'm your

2249
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,800
[ __ ] best friend kind of yeah I'll do

2250
01:30:47,819 --> 01:30:51,359
whatever it [ __ ] takes but

2251
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:54,719
um yeah I ended up

2252
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:56,219
um I ended up always you know even at

2253
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:59,698
that Garden I don't remember what the

2254
01:30:56,219 --> 01:31:02,158
strains were because I think

2255
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:03,719
um one I was a little worried because I

2256
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:05,939
didn't know what I was walking into on

2257
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:07,800
this one it was a friend of a friend

2258
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:10,138
kind of thing and when I got there you

2259
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,480
could tell it was definitely organized

2260
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:15,420
guys on two wheels yeah

2261
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:17,638
I don't want and but the Biker Bob you

2262
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:19,920
know most of the guys down riding the

2263
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:21,420
bike of Bob's road bikes yeah yeah it

2264
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,340
makes sense I'm just gonna turn on the

2265
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:25,920
light so you can see me better but yeah

2266
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:27,119
yeah did you bring your seed case with

2267
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,639
you

2268
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:31,439
I want to start going through it I

2269
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:33,600
didn't start going through it like

2270
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:35,460
sitting on my desk downstairs

2271
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,360
because I actually want to go through it

2272
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,698
all

2273
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:40,259
um I want to I want to go through it on

2274
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:42,779
the the video with you so we could just

2275
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:46,020
uh so it'd be easier I guess you should

2276
01:31:42,779 --> 01:31:47,819
just do a whole session on that yeah I

2277
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:51,179
mean yeah we have to find like because a

2278
01:31:47,819 --> 01:31:54,059
lot of the seeds I have are just like

2279
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:56,219
seeds that came to me with a story

2280
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,719
that's the but that's the best part

2281
01:31:56,219 --> 01:32:00,000
right like that's what people want to

2282
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:01,980
hear is the story so that's these these

2283
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,939
seeds can evoke a lot of these stories

2284
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:05,279
that you probably didn't even remember

2285
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:07,138
that you had about certain strains yeah

2286
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,279
but again like the Elmwood I normally

2287
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:10,319
didn't know what the [ __ ] the Elmwood is

2288
01:32:08,279 --> 01:32:11,519
right like the Elmwood is a a strain

2289
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:14,759
that was

2290
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:17,120
super popular in

2291
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:20,100
certain circles in uh

2292
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:21,899
Southwestern Ontario for outdoor right

2293
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,880
but after this people gonna be chasing

2294
01:32:21,899 --> 01:32:25,738
it guaranteed people going to be trying

2295
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:27,359
to find it I have a shitload of OCS I'll

2296
01:32:25,738 --> 01:32:29,099
send and that's something else like I

2297
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:30,779
was saying is

2298
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:35,039
um yeah but see that's the same thing

2299
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:36,599
like now you know would would uh I'm

2300
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:38,460
gonna call him Double D because I don't

2301
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,480
know that's in Canada I used to work for

2302
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,719
him

2303
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:47,579
um he's out on the East Coast obviously

2304
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:50,039
um but um if he would know about that

2305
01:32:47,579 --> 01:32:54,059
box story yeah I mean Ed would know

2306
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:57,539
about it but um I don't know too many

2307
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:59,760
people that want to talk to Ed yeah but

2308
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:01,920
oh you're referring to to Rosenthal

2309
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,480
right yeah yeah someone in the thing was

2310
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,940
like no he's referred to Ed Borg I was

2311
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:09,599
like no he's referring to Rosenthal nose

2312
01:33:05,939 --> 01:33:13,319
board yeah yeah so yeah just because

2313
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:16,980
um again that's what he told uh

2314
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:19,079
Miss for Hampton Steve when uh when he

2315
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:19,799
was working in Switzerland with those

2316
01:33:19,079 --> 01:33:23,698
guys

2317
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,860
yeah I think so you know again

2318
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:28,500
everything that we talk about

2319
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:31,439
is and I was just reading something

2320
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:34,859
today about uh the natives a native

2321
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:35,819
saying where you know people like you we

2322
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,738
wanna

2323
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:42,119
remember

2324
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:45,419
a purpose on this planet is to uh uh

2325
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:49,139
remember our Legacy or something and it

2326
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:51,779
should be to continue our story kind of

2327
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:53,940
thing and everything that we you know

2328
01:33:51,779 --> 01:33:57,238
like we're discussing here as we said

2329
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:59,698
earlier was this is what I was told and

2330
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:01,500
yeah a lot of this shit's just not

2331
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:03,419
written down it's not good and it's not

2332
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:06,000
going to be written down for obvious

2333
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:08,340
reasons so that's why you know when I

2334
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,198
get to meet guys like you I'm saying

2335
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:12,960
well if you know somebody that knows

2336
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:14,579
somebody this is what I heard yeah and

2337
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,619
they might say yeah there's no way that

2338
01:34:14,579 --> 01:34:19,500
happened and then say okay well at least

2339
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:21,779
I know now yeah well that's kind of the

2340
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,520
purpose of this podcast is that a lot of

2341
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:25,859
the history is oral like a lot of

2342
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,719
history is like verbally passed on you

2343
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:30,299
know and it always was the native yeah

2344
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:35,460
[ __ ] down you know we had some carvings

2345
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:38,039
in the in the uh in the um uh on the

2346
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:41,100
walls in the caves you know and on

2347
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:43,139
stretched out leather but no we have a

2348
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:45,360
uh everything is you know it's around

2349
01:34:43,139 --> 01:34:48,119
the campfire and tell stories and yeah

2350
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,859
hate that to the young ones and you know

2351
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:52,198
when I was at rainbow gatherings you

2352
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:56,759
know the granola Funk with the uh camp

2353
01:34:52,198 --> 01:35:00,960
that we were uh staying with and their

2354
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:03,239
contribution was uh building a stage

2355
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,239
luckily the one I went to I was able to

2356
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:08,879
help uh build a stage so the elders

2357
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:11,459
could come and tell stories about

2358
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,199
earlier years of the rainbow gathering

2359
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:15,600
and the history of jingle Gathering and

2360
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:17,279
I was like well [ __ ] you know we need

2361
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,440
that and that's what this uh what I feel

2362
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:22,679
this is is for the uh for the canvas

2363
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:25,019
industry for the for the seeds is you

2364
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:27,300
know a lot of the [ __ ] this is uh this

2365
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:30,420
is what I've been told is what I hear

2366
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:33,360
and if we can find people to like I say

2367
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:35,880
with the triple s c Golden Boy story you

2368
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:39,179
know is that you know was somebody

2369
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:41,039
pulling my leg with somebody that told

2370
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:44,219
me this did believe it because somebody

2371
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:46,079
told them that yeah I'm still tempted to

2372
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:48,658
go he's like the one person that I knew

2373
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:50,359
that was worked with Neville will help

2374
01:35:48,658 --> 01:35:53,099
them

2375
01:35:50,359 --> 01:35:57,899
I wasn't sure about using names yeah

2376
01:35:53,100 --> 01:36:00,179
yeah indeed okay yeah I think that

2377
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:01,619
I think he'd be that would he would at

2378
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:04,380
least know something I would think yeah

2379
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:08,399
so and like I said what the story was is

2380
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:10,739
you know there was uh uh somebody never

2381
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:14,219
was supposed to sell a uh a bunch of

2382
01:36:10,738 --> 01:36:16,500
genetics to somebody never came through

2383
01:36:14,219 --> 01:36:19,319
he threw him in the back of a freezer

2384
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:21,420
when he was pulling out of I believe

2385
01:36:19,319 --> 01:36:24,840
Amsterdam

2386
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:25,920
um he came across them he passed him on

2387
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,079
to Ed

2388
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,520
supposedly for like an outstanding debt

2389
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:33,719
or something like that or maybe just

2390
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:36,600
because he had them and they ended up

2391
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:38,880
um with Steve in Switzerland yeah and

2392
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,639
