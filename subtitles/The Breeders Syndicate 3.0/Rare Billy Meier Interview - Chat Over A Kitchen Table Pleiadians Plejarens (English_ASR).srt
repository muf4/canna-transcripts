1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,120
kind of touchy tripod going there

2
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,879
it's for earthquake shooting huh

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,879
kiku have a seat

4
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,719
oh yeah okay let's just get something

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,239
okay

6
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,919
okay

7
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,599
you know last night we were talking

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,679
about if you are

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,039
in the ship and you go back to the year

10
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,119
32

11
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,160
and you die there

12
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,280
and

13
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,238
we were

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,879
we weren't clear if you die in 32 on a

15
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,280
trip your spirit stays there then it has

16
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,878
to live forward again yeah

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,120
so you wouldn't come back to 1988.

18
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,518
saying 32 no

19
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:09,438
yeah you still have to spend the life

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,840
again again from that time from the past

21
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,158
to

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,680
today so so you'd have to go from 32 all

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
the way back to 1990.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,920
put your hope in here

25
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,839
[Music]

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,880
the difference between spirit and

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
spirituality

28
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,239
oh okay

29
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,118
i think we can just talk a little bit

30
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,319
about spirit forms it's probably easier

31
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,159
the

32
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,319
spirit forms that we are what is the

33
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,640
difference between spirit and spirit

34
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,639
form

35
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:03,839
there is not a difference because spirit

36
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,579
form or spirit that's exactly the same

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,079
but

38
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:07,280
[Music]

39
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,598
if we

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,280
are talking about the human being

41
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,199
we are

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,360
speaking from the spirit form

43
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,679
in the human being

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,560
and generally we speak

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,560
from the spirit

46
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,159
okay so the um

47
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,919
the spirit forum goes through many

48
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,479
material lives

49
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,479
and what is the purpose of the material

50
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,479
life

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,680
the human have to stay in a material

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,519
life to study to learn

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,120
to get a good evolution

54
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,920
that's the reason

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
why he lives

56
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,679
and

57
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,919
when he dies

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,560
the spirit or

59
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,958
the spirit form

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,598
goes to the other side and this study

61
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,598
there too

62
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,800
and if

63
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,959
the whole study is fulfilled there in

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
the other side

65
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,158
then the spirit form returns to the

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,599
earth

67
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,359
into a new human body

68
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:31,439
and then it starts

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,400
everything from the beginning again

70
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,799
is it possible to be born on another

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,959
planet than the one you die on

72
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,959
no

73
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,158
you are

74
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,399
on this planet if you are living on this

75
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,840
planet

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,799
and you die

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,080
then

78
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,120
you have to reincarnate on this planet

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,400
again

80
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,599
it's impossible to leave this planet

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
as a spirit form

82
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,200
because

83
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:08,479
this spirit form is fixed to this planet

84
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,000
where the

85
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,000
material body dies

86
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,399
how long does it take to come back into

87
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,879
a new life

88
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,758
uh the normal tornas

89
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,918
is

90
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,000
by 152

91
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,039
years

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,360
but

93
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,960
now in the new age the new time

94
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,960
there is everything changing

95
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,638
because there is

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,639
a big overpopulation

97
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,520
all of the laws

98
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,879
are somehow

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,879
broken

100
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,478
and

101
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,478
the spirit forms

102
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,239
who goes to the other side they have to

103
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,439
return

104
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,720
out of the normal time maybe they will

105
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,800
be in the other side for 10 years or 30

106
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,000
years or 70 years

107
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,199
and not 150 and 2 and then they have to

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,478
return

109
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:24,199
and these all about the overpopulation

110
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,199
we have on earth

111
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,360
is it possible for

112
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,839
us normal people to contact the other

113
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,639
side no it isn't

114
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,198
there are around there are around the

115
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,400
world 16 people

116
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,919
who are able to get contact with the

117
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,959
other side

118
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,240
but not any one of them

119
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,319
will

120
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,560
go out to tell somebody i am able to do

121
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,839
it

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,560
because it isn't necessary and it isn't

123
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:04,918
the right way the right way to do this

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,918
it's absolutely wrong

125
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,840
if somebody says he has a contact with

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,199
the oversight and

127
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:18,318
with people who died then he is a liar

128
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,600
very confused and he's thinking yeah

129
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
yeah

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,199
i think

131
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:29,680
a liar or or uh or um actor or something

132
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
a foolish person

133
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
yeah

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,240
i think so

135
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,120
many people think they are in contact

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,840
with people from the other side and

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,879
that the other side is a world just like

138
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,119
this and they go visit them all the time

139
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,439
and on the other side

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,840
is only the spirit right there's no

141
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,959
personality no

142
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,359
yeah

143
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,079
so you see and

144
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,360
there is so many people around this

145
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:02,959
world who says that they have contact

146
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,000
with the other side or with aliens

147
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,758
or

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,399
with demons or or devils or

149
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
club or whatever like

150
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,279
that's

151
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,639
that's all of the truth that's the most

152
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,478
of them

153
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,680
it's illness

154
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,959
they have overturned mind

155
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,519
they are they are sick

156
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,519
they are

157
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,960
uh

158
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
but

159
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:46,239
did the pleiadians had the ability

160
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,720
to know when a woman is pregnant for

161
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,038
instance on a pleiadian world

162
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
do they can the pleiadians tell who the

163
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,439
spirit is coming in

164
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,599
yes they have to fully believe it

165
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,079
how soon can they tell

166
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,519
when do they know

167
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,680
they can do this in a very short time

168
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,279
maybe

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
20 minutes half an hour

170
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,038
because they go to

171
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,038
recognize

172
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,839
what's happened there

173
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,840
which spirit

174
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,478
is there in

175
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,000
in the new baby who is created they have

176
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,639
the possibilities on on a

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,038
meditative way

178
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,399
so that helps them understand who the

179
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,278
spirit is then

180
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
so they have a better ability to help

181
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,399
that person you know

182
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,159
yeah

183
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,559
i think this would be good for school

184
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,559
for education then yes of course yeah

185
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,040
billy one of the most common questions

186
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,360
is um

187
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,919
there are a lot of people on earth and

188
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,639
many people would like to know if it's

189
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,360
possible why did the pleiadians contact

190
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,879
you was there a special reason

191
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,000
that's a special reason

192
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,600
because

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,120
i'm the single one on earth who is able

194
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,040
to have

195
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,560
no

196
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:31,120
physical contact or no telepathic

197
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,199
contact with the pleiadians

198
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,879
there is no any

199
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,000
other human being on earth who is who is

200
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,159
able

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,639
to do the same thing

202
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,559
like i do

203
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,240
and

204
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,199
this has

205
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,440
is have a very long story

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,959
it goes back

207
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,480
to

208
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:58,958
a very old time

209
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,159
on the stars

210
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:06,000
of the lira picture and vega picture

211
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,519
and

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,159
to a label who is called our heart of

213
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,159
the result

214
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,278
and

215
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,720
my spirit form

216
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,799
was

217
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,440
very long time ago million billion years

218
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,479
trillion years ago

219
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,160
in the level of the

220
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,560
arahat after that and came back

221
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,559
to the human world

222
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,159
to teach the people

223
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,639
in the true

224
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,000
about creation

225
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,679
and they love

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,679
say the wealth

227
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,278
and uh

228
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,439
this happens

229
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,240
on the lyrian planets

230
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,839
so

231
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,879
and the vegan planet so and then at late

232
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,399
time on the earth too

233
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,240
because the old lyrians and vegans came

234
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,278
to earth

235
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,120
and the old spirit form

236
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,879
of my

237
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,000
came with them

238
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,078
as a human in a human being

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,480
who was teaching the people here on

240
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,479
earth

241
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,879
and then on earth we have

242
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:31,519
a very true line

243
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:35,120
from the oldest time up to today where i

244
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,078
have done always the same job

245
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,078
the same mission

246
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,200
do you think your mission uh will there

247
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,399
be more lifetimes for the mission

248
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,399
yes there has to be

249
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,639
uh are the pleiadians i think the

250
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,519
pleiadians are related to us somehow

251
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,159
that many of us uh maybe are politian

252
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,839
some people think or lyrians and are

253
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:04,240
there uh

254
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:07,680
uh there are not pleiadians on earth

255
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,600
there are old lyrians and vegans on

256
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,519
earth

257
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,959
there was a

258
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,519
leadership

259
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,518
by 144

260
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,958
207

261
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,958
different people

262
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,440
and they was leading

263
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,959
all the

264
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:35,519
lyrians and vegans who came

265
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,518
from the star picture there to earth

266
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
by

267
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,839
some 50 or

268
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,800
52 million people

269
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,360
from from vega and

270
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,359
lira

271
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,639
and

272
00:12:51,120 --> 00:13:00,000
if we have alien

273
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,799
alien uh spirit forms on earth then only

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,759
lurians and vegans

275
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:11,278
and from the planet malona who destroyed

276
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,120
in our solar system

277
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,480
and these are about

278
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,600
around about 50 or

279
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,639
55 million too

280
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,000
and other aliens we haven't on earth

281
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,600
without them who are coming here for

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
visiting or exploring

283
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,958
so

284
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,839
many people who think they maybe they

285
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,518
used to live on a pleiadian world and

286
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,480
you think there are any spirits here

287
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,198
that used to be pleiadians

288
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,199
no no

289
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,879
pleiadians not

290
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,919
really one of the

291
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,519
more interesting things i think

292
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,919
the stories we've heard about is your

293
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,879
time travels it's very fascinating

294
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,198
because

295
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,600
time is something that's very difficult

296
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,719
to understand for all of us

297
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,879
and

298
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,040
i think one of the things we've many

299
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,679
people would like to know if you can

300
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,480
go back in time like you have in the

301
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,479
ship

302
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,879
is it possible to go back and change

303
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,600
history can you change right now if you

304
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,039
went back in time no you can't

305
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,480
change history

306
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,639
oh you can't

307
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,680
you know what would happen if you went

308
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,839
back say 100 years and uh

309
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,719
changed your parents or caused them not

310
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,839
even

311
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
it's impossible

312
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,519
you can't go back to kill somebody that

313
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,518
you know shall be living today it's

314
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,000
impossible

315
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,799
it's not possible to go back to change

316
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,799
your parents

317
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,679
what happened

318
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,519
what was going on

319
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,519
is what's going on and it's not

320
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,519
changeable

321
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,120
that's a a

322
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
little bit

323
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,120
a funny idea of the human being

324
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,638
to can do something like this but it is

325
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,759
impossible

326
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,240
i think in the movies because in in in

327
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,000
the movie you can lose

328
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:24,079
things but uh in reality it's absolutely

329
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,958
impossible because there are laws

330
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,679
uh

331
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:31,039
and then

332
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,599
they you don't can go to break because

333
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,639
these are laws of the creation the

334
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,959
creation uh with the creation you can't

335
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,959
play

336
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,559
until not with the laws

337
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,958
billy at uh one of your time travel

338
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,799
trips the you were

339
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,039
the pleiadians made it possible for you

340
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,039
to go visit emmanuel

341
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,679
and

342
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,679
who who was emmanuel is he a man just

343
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,679
like us or did what did they tell you

344
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,479
about him

345
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,319
about whom emmanuel

346
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,278
immanuel he was a man

347
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,278
like us you must nothing else

348
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,680
did they have uh did the pleiadians were

349
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,679

for us or why are they contacting us

through you

we have all written in our books

and

382
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,080
the most important point of this message

383
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,279
is this

384
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,480
to

385
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:09,038
teach the earth people

in the movies they usually portray

392
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,120
extraterrestrials as monsters or

393
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,918
dangerous or

394
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,279
using their ships to you know harm us

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,720
do you think we should

396
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,720
is there any fear from the bleeding

397

by 100 to 100 meters

543
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,639

yeah they have around about 1 000 years

548
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,880
is that because of medical advances

549
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,880
for scientists the whole evolution

550
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:55,880
and to the old lyrians and the old

551
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,880
wagons they had a very high lifetime

552
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,519
um

553
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,038

[Music]

555
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,480
the spiritual part

556
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,038
i have to say another way

557
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,919
the

558
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,200
game which

559
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:43,038
is the spiritual part of that

560
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,080
what we have in the material

561
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,278
part of

562
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,278
the psyche

563
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,918
so it's the counterpart to the

564
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,960
to the site beyond the material side of

565
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,840
the mind

566
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,919
yeah i think it's like a sensor or

567
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,918
something you said that connects us to

568
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,759
creation

569
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,640
uh you see the the commute is in the

570
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,319
spiritual part

571
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,200
the same thing

572
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,918
what we have of psyche

573
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,240
in the material part in the in in the

574
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,159
physical body

575
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,720
and

576
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,720
the mood is working

577
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,720
on the same wise

578
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:30,720
as the posture psyche

579
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:34,278
together with the wisdom

580
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,278
and the feeling

581
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,839
of the spirit

582
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:46,798
like the psyche in the material material

583
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,799
body with the thinking and the feelings

584
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,240
one thing i know people are curious

585
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,200
about is

586
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,000
why we're born either a man or a woman

587
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,919
and do we go back and forth and if you

588
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,880
are a woman do you stay a woman for a

589
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,919
long time or does it go back and forth

590
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,799
no you can't change this from lifetime

591
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,799
to lifetime

592
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,520
if you stay in this life you

593
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,960
are a man

594
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,359
now and

595
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,079
do you like to be a woman

next reincarnation or next incarnation

to

if a woman or if a man

thinking yes and if you leave this life

without clear thinking and you are

627
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:42,239
confused to be a man or a woman then

side

632
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,158

uh help them

658
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:09,759
maybe by uh

659
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,879
what do you say uh

lifetime

666

then you can help them get their

667
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:33,038
thinking clear and the next time they

668

it's absolutely possible is it possible

678
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,480

incarnations

703
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,599
on this earth and then

704
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,240
you will be so clever

705
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,439
to get out of your body

706
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,200
to come a light body or a spirit but it

707
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,200
is absolutely impossible

708
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,679
the earliest point you need will be by

709
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,038
60 billion

710
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,159

billions or millions inclinations or

713

reincarnations

714
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,640
after we

715
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,200
evolve into light body and past that we

716
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,640
evolved back into creation

717
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,880
does that mean that the sentence takes a

718
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,440
very long time yes

719
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,720
does that mean that the central core of

720
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,240
the universe the central sun is

721
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,079
is that uh

722
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,329
spirit forms things that used to be

723
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:56,368
spirit forms have now evolved into that

[Music]

725
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:04,000
the central form or the central sun

726
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,120
what you ever will say

727
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,159
that's

00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,878
the creation spirit

729
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,878
the going out of everything

730
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:16,960
from our universe

731
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,960
and of every life form

732
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,759
and

733
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,480
there

734
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,760
we will go back

735
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,320
one time

736
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,960
very far in the future

737
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,320
if you are

738
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,559
in our evolution so high

739
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,679
to be able

740
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,679
to get the connection with that power

741
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,119
but there are

742
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:48,559
[Music]

743
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,000
if we as human

744
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:53,599
live

745
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,519
or lose our bodies

746
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,960
and grows up

747
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:01,280
to a light form wars or spirit form

748
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,280
that's

749
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:07,039
the first step

750
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:09,118
what i told you between 60 and 80

751
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,079
billion years

752
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,920
then our water levels

753
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,000
with several trillion years and

754
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,200
quadrillion years

755
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,838
it goes higher and higher up up to the

756
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:27,039
highest point and the last one is the

757
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:29,358
level of the darling

758
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:33,599
before

the creation herself

760
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,320
and from the fatali level

761
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,119
it's possible

762
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
to

763
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,838
get

764
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,559
the highest

765
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,719
uh

766
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:50,639
highest body

767
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:54,480
of spirit the finest body of spirit

768

once with her

770
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,320
what's in turn

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,359
um anger hate jealousy

oh

773
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,039
are we born with those emotions

774
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,358
emotions

775
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:32,000
uh that's made out of the human being

776
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,000
himself

777
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,200
[Music]

778
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,599
he makes himself

779
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,598
anger

780
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,000
he makes himself laugh

he makes himself everything

782
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,320
what's falling into emotion

783
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,838
motion have to be

784
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,599
controlled

785
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,599
by the human being

786
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,960
that it's

787
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,559
that it is

788
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,440
giving out

789
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,279
a point

790
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,280
of

00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,480
not on that way

793
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:30,480
that if you are angry goes to kill

794
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,480
somebody or to hit somebody

795
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,320
motions

796
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,039
they are always

797
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,960
on this kind of like the human being

798
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,199
then use or

799
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,559
prepare

800
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,559
always wrong

801
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,598
they are not good

802
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,239
you have these

803
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:59,358
motions

804
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:03,439
to use them

805
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:04,719
on this way that you start to control

806
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,280
them

807
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:10,879
and the best thing

808
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,240
what's going out us results

809
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,599
of them

810
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:18,679
to use

811
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,680
for yourself and for your evolution

812
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,399
you understand what i mean yeah

813
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,960
billy there are many people that are

814
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,559
fascinated with the continent of

815
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,079
atlantis did was that a pleiadian

816
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,440
continent did the pleiadians have

817
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,560
something to do with atlantis

818
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,000
uh the pleiadians have nothing to do

819
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,719
with

820
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,719
old atlantis

821
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,200
the old lyrians and vegans had

822
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,200
something to do with atlantis

823
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,839
i mean

824
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,039
some

825
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,400
parts

826
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:09,440
of the lyrians and vegans who who

827
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,760
had stations here on earth

828
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,400
who was living here on earth

829
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,400
but they got trouble together

830
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,400
and so

831
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,160
and then they destroyed atlantis

832
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,079
through

833
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,639
adonis

834
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,599
this means

835
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,159
uh

836
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,160
a small

837
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,280
or a big

838
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,280
asteroid

839
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,480
they brought to earth

840
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,480
and destroyed atlantis with them

841
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:53,358
we have uh a story simiosi told us

842
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,838
uh such a story about uplandism what's

843
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:58,078
happened

844
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,199
there it's all written in the contract

845
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,519
notes

846
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,919
i read that it was fascinating how it

847
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,759
all came to an end

848
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,400
yeah

849
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,680
there was a city called moo

850
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:16,639
that they had on uh

851
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:20,078
mu i think was the copic daw city

852
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,078
of the enemies

853
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:26,078
of the

854
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,039
atlantis people and who

855
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,400
was

856
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:34,079
how i know or i think

857
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,079
in the chinese state

858
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:41,598
are there any people left from atlantis

859
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,599
or mu or any of them still here

860
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,280
there shall be

861
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,199
some people left

862
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,000
and they shall

863
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:55,519
live in

864
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,519
underground cities

865
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,960
near the himalaya

866
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,358
india

867
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,960
and

868
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,440
they have

869
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,159
bluish color

870
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,159
on the skin

871
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:16,400
i have seen at once in india three

872
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,598
people with bluish color and i think

873
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,920
they came from there

874
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:26,880
it was absolutely

875
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:31,119
all normal in india to see people think

876
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,119
blues would kind of stand out but

877
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,160

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,280
that's the first step

1055
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,838
and

1056
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,838
to

1057
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,839
keep

1058
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:23,280
these things not telling

1059
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:23,279
the inner voice and to work with them

1060
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,640
and the second

1061
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,400
thing

1062
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:30,239
is

1063
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,680
learn to see

1064
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,959
to hear

1065
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:37,519
to feel

1066
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,519
to speak on a very clear way

1067
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:48,640
and then the meditation themselves

1068
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:50,558
and if the meditation is done after

1069
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:54,400
some years

1070
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:57,599
if the meditation is coming clear and

1071
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,599
clear and good

1072
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,240
then

1073
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,078
the human can go

1074
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:07,078
a step

1075
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,079
higher

1076
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,280
and then he can do the initiation

1077
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,800
and this means

1078
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:19,599
he can begin to start

1079
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,559
to talk

1080
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,838
with

1081
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,839
his inner voice

1082
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,599
with

1083
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,599
his

1084
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,919
consciousness consciousness

1085
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,880
and

1086
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,838
with the spiritual part

1087
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,838
in him

1088
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:44,000
billy are you still having contacts with

1089
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:44,000
samyasi

1090
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:49,838
uh the contact with samyasi

1091
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:52,078
ended

1092
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:52,078
on

1093
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,440
84

1094
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:04,078
then select our planet

1095
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,440
and left our universe to the dull

1096
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,920
universe

1097
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:12,639
and there she is now living for the next

1098
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:15,680
70 or 72 years without any returning to

1099
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:15,679
our universe

1100
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,599
the contacts with semiasia they are also

1101
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,558

1114
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,879

1115
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,558

working

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,000
this very old time

1132
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:44,639
together with the pleiadians

1133
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,519
and also 24 25 000 people

have

1135
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:51,599
contact on impulse bus

1136
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:55,598
base

1137
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,880
although they don't know anything

1138
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,480
about

1139
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,160
that

1140
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:07,760
that they have contacts that they

1141
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:07,759
get impulses from outside from aliens

1142
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,800
not any one of them

1143
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,079
and

1144
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:22,559
there was two other persons in germany

1145
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:26,440
they had a telepathic conduct

1146
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,440
to the pleiadians

1147
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,519
not

1148
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,639
by semi-auto

1149
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,960
there was

1150
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,838
some other people

1151
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,760
responsible for them but these two

1152
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:42,719
people a man

1153
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,760
and a 16 year old

1154
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:46,078
girl

1155
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,359
they died in the meantime they had an

1156
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,039
accident

1157
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:51,279
in

1158
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,838
italy

1159
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,839
and

1160
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,400
the

1161
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:04,959
the reason for that that these two two

1162
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,480
people had contact

1163
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,720
telepathic contact with the pleiadians

1164
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,960
was this because

1165
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:12,959
they

1166
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,640
should come

1167
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,519
to inform the people

1168
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:26,558
about my mission

1169
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:29,440
stop everything i'm bringing is true

1170
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:32,798
and that i'm working on this mission

1171
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,798
with the pleiadians

1172
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:36,400
they

1173
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,720
was something

1174
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,720
like

1175
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,960
a proof

1176
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:47,679
for me

1177
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,559
but they died by accident

1178
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:53,358
and now i'm the single one who has

1179
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:56,319
telepathic contact with the pleiadians

1180
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:58,960
and physical conduct

1181
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:01,759
and there is no any

1182
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,159
connection

1183
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,079
between

1184
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:08,318
the pleiadians

1185
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:12,640
and any other

1186
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:17,838
earth human being if men if child or is

1187
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:17,838
born there is just really nothing

1188
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,358
and

1189
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,480
each one who

1190
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:24,480
comes and says

1191
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:33,119

for human to live there

1214

00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:02,719
blue

1229
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:06,960
and

1230
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,000
that's the thing

1231
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,760
but

1232
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,760
all they who say oh i have contact with

1233
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,760
pleiadians not nose

1234
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,838
there is not

1235
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:24,880
one human being there up on the

1236
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:24,880
pleiadians nobody home

1237
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:32,400
[Music]

1238
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,440
play aliens

1239
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,720
the pleiadians they say that they are

1240
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,720
coming from

1241
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:42,959
the play artist they say it is about

1242
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:44,558
that point

1243
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,199
they have

1244
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:51,040
a second thought

1245
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:52,639
a little part or a short part of a

1246
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:57,279
second

1247
00:58:52,639 --> 00:59:02,960
different time out of our

1248
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,960
time of our room and our space

1249
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,838
a point

1250
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,599
where are

1251
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,639
the

1252
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,640
the pleiades

1253
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:20,880
you know

1254
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:23,440
uh if here are the players we can see on

1255
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,440
the sky

1256
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:30,960
there are in other room space

1257
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:34,798
other planets

1258
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,440
and they call them by the same names

1259
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:40,079
what we call the plate is what we can

1260
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,200
see from here on the sky

1261
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,839
but it's in the other room time

1262
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,798
much more

1263
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:52,078
finer than our room time

1264
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:52,079
and room space

1265
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,838
and

1266
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:01,200
their structure is

1267
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:05,119
much more finer

1268
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:06,558
as our structure as human being from the

1269
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:10,480
earth

1270
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:13,359
and it's impossible for them

1271
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:16,159
to make shake hands

1272
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:16,159
with the human

1273
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:19,358
on earth

1274
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:21,119
or

1275
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:24,000
only go

1276
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,480
near them because it's very dangerous

1277
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,480
for them

1278
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:33,920
and they also are out of our room space

1279
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,519
out of our

1280
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,519
uh time space

1281
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,559
they are not there where are our players

1282
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:50,639
billy what is telepathy and can we

1283
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,639
develop it

1284
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:58,318
that's kind

1285
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,000
of

1286
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,519
hearing

1287
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,760
to

1288
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:08,639
of listen

1289
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,119
but on a very very fine way

1290
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:13,358
you use the heirs

1291
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,920
for is for this

1292
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:19,440
for this telepathy we call it the

1293
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,440
primary telepathy

1294
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:24,400
that's not

1295
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,760
the real telepathy

1296
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:34,480
the real telepathy that spiritual

1297
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:37,280
telepathy disc goes on and is based on

1298
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,280
symbols

1299
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,400
but

1300
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,719
the

1301
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,480
the primary telepathy

1302
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:45,759
is working

1303
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,318
on

1304
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,319
wars

1305
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,318
on wards and on pictures

1306
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:55,199
real

1307
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:58,719
like

1308
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,719
a photography or

1309
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,440
or something a body or something

1310
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,598
what you can

1311
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,159
produce

1312
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,160
into

1313
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,759
other human being

1314
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,558
through

1315
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,559
his air

1316
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:19,118
and through his

1317
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,920
i think we're gonna have to give the

1318
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,920
kitchen up soon but before we stop um

1319
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:39,440
are we able to evolve far enough in this

1320
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,480
life to be able to get into the akashi

1321
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,798
records

1322
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,240
and to learn our personal keys well

1323
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,838
first of all maybe you could tell us

1324
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:51,199
what is the akashic record

1325
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:52,000
uh the apache ray cards

1326
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:53,519
is

1327
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,239
we call it

1328
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:59,440
we call it by open name

1329
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,439
cosmical spike

1330
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,519
uh

1331
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:11,199
their

1332
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:12,719
records everything that stops a level

1333
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:15,879
around

1334
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:15,879
the sphere

1335
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,680
around the earth

1336
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,039
and there will be recorded

1337
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:26,399
everything

1338
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:29,760
what is doing a human being

1339
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:33,119
what he is thinking what he is feeling

1340
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,960
what he is speaking what he is doing

1341
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,000
everything will be

1342
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,440
there recorded

1343
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,358
and

1344
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:45,440
if you die

1345
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:49,519
and return in a other incarnation

1346
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:53,599
you will get imposes from there

1347
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:53,599
and then you get an honor

1348
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:58,960
unknown

1349
01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:01,680
and then you know things you know

1350
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:06,400
you get results

1351
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:06,399
without knowing from there

1352
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,559
that's all the made out

1353
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,879
of

1354
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:16,160
uh of this

1355
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,160
cardi record

1356
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,960
and

1357
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,920
sometimes

1358
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,039
you can't find people but they are very

1359
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,680
very

1360
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,200
few only

1361
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:33,519
they can

1362
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:33,519
use the akashi records

1363
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:38,000
for

1364
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:42,720
getting impulses

1365
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,880
out of their from other people not from

1366
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:48,239
himself

1367
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,920
because his frequency

1368
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,078
is

1369
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,039
very near

1370
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:59,920
to them of the older one

1371
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,920
who he can get impulses from them

1372
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:05,119
then maybe can be

1373
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,118
a drawer

1374
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:11,838
or or a writer or or a companies or

1375
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,200
something

1376
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:18,759
who get impulses and then you say oh

1377
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:18,759
that's michelangelo

1378
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:26,960
he had contact with michelangelo but he

1379
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:31,920
hasn't contacted michelangelo he only

1380
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:33,358
get impulses out of the arcadia records

1381
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,720
from

1382
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:39,279
that frequency who had

1383
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:42,399
especially what i told you

1384
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:46,880
uh michelangelo

1385
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,880
how did we learn to use the keys

1386
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,519
through the meditation too

1387
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:54,558
everything you will do on on spiritual

1388
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:58,318
way

1389
01:05:54,559 --> 01:06:00,240
or on common consciousness on

1390
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,960
consciousness way

1391
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:05,519
is going through the meditation and

1392
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,960
initiation

1393
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,358
always

1394
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:13,280
there is no other way

1395
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:15,838
billy we always talk about the word love

1396
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,839
what is it

1397
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:20,480
got a few days

1398
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:26,400
it's uh it's impossible to tell you in a

1399
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:26,400
short way

1400
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,480

wendell stephens i think made a model

when you were taking pictures

some of the pictures are floating around

short question know

01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:11,039
why they made the model this uh

01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:13,600
there was made two models

stephens and lee elders and tom welch
