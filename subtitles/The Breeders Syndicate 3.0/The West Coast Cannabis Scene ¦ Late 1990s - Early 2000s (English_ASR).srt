51
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,520
million years ago when i first came to

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,360

and coming from illinois where i'm from

57
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,239
where it's flat as a pancake because of

58
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,359
the glacier it was i thought it was like

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,080
ireland

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,640
yeah it was all like rolling hills and

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,959
flowers and it was brutally cold where i

62
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,279
lived and it was so nice here

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,039
and i had no idea got to like 110 and

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
everything died in summer

65
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,159

71
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,318
uh that's not my favorite part of

72
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,519

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,599
mccarthy come on

77
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:15,519

and dry and very very hot you know yeah

79
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
warm nights and good people good fun

80
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,280
yeah indeed

81
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,439
so what what is our topic for tonight as

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,919
far as education goes as far as

83
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,479
education goes i thought we would chat

84
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,399
about a couple of things

85
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,399
we would talk about maybe sort of like

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,879
the very late 90s early 2000s uh period

87
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,120
in the west coast

88
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,639
and because there's a whole bunch of

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
stuff then

90
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,039
that's pretty pertinent to now

91
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,360
it was all kind of going on and then i

92
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,359
think we might talk about at some point

93
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,080
probably will fit in because it's been

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,159
uh a big topic amongst us this week is a

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,560
little bit of like authenticity

96
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,919
yeah and uh how to you know how to

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,920
address that yeah how do you address

98
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,318
authenticity in these uh

99
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,238
times where everybody's making money off

100
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,598
something being authentic

101
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,200
well yeah and people you know people

102
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,438
have their own their own motivations

103
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,959
their own wants needs and desires

104
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,319
yeah you know that type of stuff and so

105
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
you know because

106
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,120
um

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,639
some cherry pie cush talk

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,319
cherry pie might be able to fit into

109
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
that a little late i've kind of avoided

110
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,279
the whole cookie thing yet yeah it's

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,759
probably a couple episodes on its own

112
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,758
and it's pretty complex so

113
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,240
uh we probably will chat about that at

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,319
some point but it needs uh that one

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,879
needs some fleshing out a bit

116
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,000
yeah i would say yeah yeah it's gonna be

117
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
a deep one

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,439
yeah that's a deep one and there's a lot

119
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,040
of people making a lot of money off it

120
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,879
and there's a lot of rep on it so the

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,639
more money and rep you have it kind of

122
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,040
ties into the authenticity thing we were

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,800
just talking about yep uh you start

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,240
talking history and it interferes with

125
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
anybody's money or rap and all of a

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
sudden they're extremely upset

127
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,638
yeah you know

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,478
uh

129
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
you know i mean i made this i made this

130
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,000
like joking post i don't post much

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,038
post i saw this cartoon and it was like

133
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,120
i remember it differently

134
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:18,079
in a way that fits my world view and

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
paints me in a positive light

136
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,439
yeah that's for sure and you know

137
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
relating to weed history like you run

138
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,759
into that a lot

139
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,119
yeah you know you you run into that a

140
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,479
lot

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,439

blue bonnet seems to throw these days at

163
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,800

164
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,639

no i mean

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,280
there's actually a tie-in to

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,560
well i have my own blueberry line that i

172
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,000
created before

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,079
during the time that blue bonnet was

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
being made and the

175
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,318
lone star was kind of competition to me

176
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,840
at the time and i was very egotistical

177
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,879
about my blueberry of course because

178
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,079
everybody thinks they have the best

179
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,159
blueberry and i used it and it did very

180
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,918
true for blue traits and very beautiful

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,560
blue terps and very pretty but it didn't

182
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,879
have much potency a resin production to

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,079
speak of and i think lone star did it

184
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,800
better than i did i really do

185
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,560
so yeah and what we're lucky

186
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,240
is that it still exists

187
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,639
yes and you can still get it from a

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
number of different sources yes

189
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,439
wow

190
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,879
a ton so

191
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,120
uh we're getting there i think we're up

192
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,240
to a decent time so we're gonna start

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,918
um and uh these talks have kind of been

194
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,598
we've we've been kind of moving forward

195
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,000
we started in the beginning in the 90s a

196
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,639
bit now we're starting to move forward

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,439
we actually still have like a third wave

198
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,439
of seed banks that matt and i want to do

199
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,439
um that we never actually dealt with

200
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,519
that involves canada and everything else

201
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,719
but it starts to get a little bit more

202
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,719
dispersed and difficult to get the the

203
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,360
accurate stuff so it's taken us kind of

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,639
a while yeah so yeah there's a lot to it

205
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,639
and there's a lot to cover you don't

206
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,918
want to leave out a lot of stuff and

207
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,360
you don't want to forget a lot of stuff

208
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,959
and some stuff we do leave out and

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,800
forget and have to go back and tag

210
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,318
because it isn't that important so yeah

211
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,759
and that's kind of you know that's kind

212
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,598
of one of the things about these talks

213
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,360
is there a bunch of history there's some

214
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,839
there's some speculation there's some

215
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
bullshitting um they're trying to be

216
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,598
conversational and tell people about the

217
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,439
memories that people have

218
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,878
um they you know we'll talk about things

219
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,160
but they they get people been under

220
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
shape already

221
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,840
um so rather than talking about like the

222
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,918
third wave of seed banks i thought we

223
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,478
could chat more about like what was

224
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,478
happening on the west coast yeah which

225
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,240
is where matt and i both live

226
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,719
uh what was happening on the west coast

227
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,879
in that era and how specifically

228
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,680
california and how that kind of like

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,720
started to impact what came after

230
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,639
yeah

231
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,320
right so

232
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,838
just to let everybody know

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,959
um in 1996 in november they passed the

234
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,159
215 act uh the proposition 215 in

235
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,759
california

236
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,000
and that made it was the first state

237
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,919
where you had medical

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,519
yeah now you know medical was uh

239
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,199
very restrictive at first and it was

240
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
only about four or five conditions that

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,920
it applied to

242
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
and the cops had spent their whole

243
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,000
career just busting anyone with weeds so

244
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,759
they were also slow to change

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
yes because they saw weed and they were

246
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,919
like [ __ ] you it's weird i'm arresting

247
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,759
you

248
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:10,799
and so people think that it like just

249
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:13,838
became legal in 1997 uh it did not

250
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,879
um it started a slow process

251
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,720
right

252
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,039
and the era we're going to talk about is

253
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
sort of like the very beginning of when

254
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,079
gorilla started to end and that process

255
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
started to really take place yeah you

256
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
know there was the very beginning of

257
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,480
medical in california so things were

258
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,399
starting to open up

259
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,839
people were starting to be less

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
secretive

261
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,399
um and as we mentioned on shows before i

262
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,640
think it was 1999

263
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,399
that overgrowth started

264
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,679
and not that long after the cannabis

265
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,039
world started

266
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,919
i i don't know the years on when they

267
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,199
started

268
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,278
um so

269
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,040
you know after a few years you had this

270
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,919
network of people

271
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,719
um that were connecting via these

272
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,679
via these you know these forums

273
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,879
yeah

274
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,639
and chatting and stuff like that and so

275
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,519
one that ended up happening

276
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,838
is

277
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,759
uh you know this this started a whole

278
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,640
wave of different things it started uh

279
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,000
there was you know really the forums

280
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,000
were the first time you could really

281
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,559
ever trade outside your circle that you

282
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
knew in person yeah

283
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,879
you know

284
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,519
right

285
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,000
yeah i mean even even today i i still

286
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,519
see people uh you know in other states

287
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,958
where they say you know i can't get that

288
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,120
clone i live in this state and it kind

289
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,039
of blows my mind because back then even

290
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
like that we didn't all live in like

291
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,719
people were getting bubble clones from

292
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,639
ohio you know that were in california

293
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
you know what i mean like if

294
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,919
you didn't necessarily go to the state

295
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,359
to get it

296
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,039
yeah and i mean you know one of the

297
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,079
things that's interesting about that is

298
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,199
that

299
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,439
you know there's there's different

300
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
people uh for a lot of people

301
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,120
um we have a good buddy of ours that

302
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,920
lives back in the midwest

303
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
and

304
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,479
you know for him the forums and ig and

305
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,518
discord and stuff like that was a way

306
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,120
for him to talk to other weed nerds yeah

307
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,278
right but for somebody like me who lives

308
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
in mendo like everyone around me does

309
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,399
what i do

310
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,079
yeah so there's no shortage of hanging

311
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
out like i'm surrounded by people like

312
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,278
me so there was some people that like

313
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,200
were

314
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,240
you know really intent upon getting on

315
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,519
there and that was their mode of

316
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,919
communication

317
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
yeah and some of us just lived in places

318
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,159
and stayed off all that

319
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,920
yeah you know so like when you popped up

320
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,078
or whatever it doesn't really like

321
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,599
correlate to like what you're up to we

322
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,519
all lived in the shadows

323
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,159
yeah right so

324
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,039
tying into that i'm uh i'm probably in

325
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,159
my

326
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,000
i don't know what it is i'm probably in

327
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,120
my mid-20s

328
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,278
or so

329
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,879
and i meet this guy and i don't think

330
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:43,919
it's weird to say his name his name was

331
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,439
ron uh yeah no right yeah yeah and uh

332
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,919
matt knows ron

333
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,519
very well very well yeah and ron was

334
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,559
around the character and he's still

335
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,039
around

336
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:56,159

00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,038
a lot of people that were active on the

503
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,038
forums

504
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,400
um it was

505
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,160
five or six or seven years uh before

506
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,280
the reversal era

507
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,200
yeah

508
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,160
so everything was everything was red

509
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,279
seeds

510
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,440
yeah

511
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,599
everything there wasn't any

512
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,120
nes one i don't even think i'd heard the

513
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,119
term s1 outside of a book yeah

514
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,798
i don't think so i doubt so everything

515
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,159
yeah everything everything was hybrids

516
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,558
you know and people would bring their

517
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
hash bring their seeds bring their own

518
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,160
personal breedings

519
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,919
and it was like a way instead of mailing

520
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,240
each other and giving out addresses and

521
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,440
dms and all that it was like a super

522
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,279
swap meet

523
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,960
right

524
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,240
and so it was really neat in that regard

525
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,440
because

526
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,000
for one thing

527
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,720
uh ron had a catering business so part

528
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,960
of the money that everybody pitched in

529
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,440
he hired his whole team

530
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,798
and you and he made two meals a day for

531
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,960
three days

532
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,279
that's wild that's cool yeah you got to

533
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,279
sit there and roll joints and smoke and

534
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,839
shoot the [ __ ] and pull tubes and trade

535
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,480
seeds and then you're [ __ ] starving

536
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,399
right and then like some like tuna on

537
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,440
crisps comes by the thing you know and

538
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,880
you're like

539
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
i want some of that and you're just so

540
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,520
high and you start eating some of that

541
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,798
and drinking how you feel a million

542
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,798
times better

543
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,119
um and so

544
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,038
the reason i bring that up is because

545
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,879
while now with a lot of these events and

546
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,079
a lot of these lives and a lot of a lot

547
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
of times like

548
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,879
uh putting a face to a name has become

549
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,200
common yeah but back then it was

550
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,280
uncommon yeah very

551
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,279
so it was like really it was really it

552
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,480
was really like unusual and neat you

553
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,519
felt special

554
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,319
yeah

555
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,400
you know and i mean there was uh you

556
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,960
know there was times where i mean i went

557
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
i went there i think yeah the foods were

558
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,720
to die for olds and they were really

559
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,720
good they were fully catered full-on

560
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,000
meals they'd have snacks and hors

561
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,759
d'oeuvres that would be get brought

562
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,038
around finger food and stuff it was

563
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,798
pretty decadent

564
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,079
yeah you know and then just like

565
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,918
anything else even if you're an

566
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,480
experienced smoker

567
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,880
you start smoking 8 10 15 kinds of weed

568
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,960
you don't normally smoke yeah and it's

569
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,080
the first time you're smoking all of

570
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,000
them

571
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,918
even weak or moderate weed will get you

572
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,359
pretty baked yeah eventually if you're

573
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,840
just pulling all day non-stop yeah you

574
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,678
get [ __ ] yeah and so you know there

575
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,918
was different things where it was like

576
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,480
you can't hang out with everyone

577
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,679
yeah so you know you make friends some

578
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,839
friends i made there um you know

579
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,400

00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,240
yeah others like csi i didn't catch up

581
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,159
with again for a number of years after

582
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,798
those yeah because you just you're in

583
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,520
different directions people you know all

584
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,839
that different types of stuff and um

585
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,759
you know uh eddie just it was kind of

586
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,519
just like a who's who

587
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,440
yeah and a lot of a lot of the times

588
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,918
those people fletch people that weren't

589
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,400
very well known then yeah but now

590
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,919
they're all hella well known yeah

591
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,679
you know and they have some of the best

592
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,360
seed banks you know some of the best

593
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,200
breeders around

594
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,319
some of the best collections of weed

595
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,400
around

596
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,000
yeah um you know when i went there i

597
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,720
didn't have most of the stuff that i

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,519
have now but i had i had the maui and i

599
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,519
had the the chem 91 and the super skunk

600
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,359
and i had the super dog

601
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,639
um my uh

602
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,519
my buddy who doesn't like to be

603
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,159
mentioned uh you know uh from staten

604
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,119
island he came a couple years with us

605
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,799
you know

606
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,319
um because we were still like right in

607
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,839
the middle of doing that super dog

608
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,879
project then

609
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,720
so

610
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,320
yeah we had different phenos we had the

611
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,400
super skunk we had different things we

612
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,439
had hash that we had sifted from things

613
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,720
and

614
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,798
all that so

615
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,798
it was just a really neat

616
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,480
gathering and time period

617
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,720
yeah people keep asking like what

618
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,120
happened but i think i think we did a

619
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,519
good job of recreating a little bit of

620
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,519
that just a few years ago

621
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,200
a lot of people weren't invited you know

622
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,119
because it was smaller but i think i

623
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,279
think that there's still an ability for

624
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,119
our community to pull together like that

625
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,918
and have these big events where people

626
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,678
just get along chill and smoke weed

627
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,080
yeah so it was a privilege because i

628
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,320
wasn't around for for the wrong parties

629
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,000
at all but it was a privilege to be a

630
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,839
part of the the canned illuminati

631
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,240
parties those are it was [ __ ] insane

632
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,918
to be a fly on the wall at those events

633
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,120
yeah i mean they keep they do keep

634
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,559
happening

635
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,399
um but i i will say that like they

636
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:03,279
probably won't happen like that quite

637
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,360
again

638
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,480
no um just for the simple fact that [ __ ]

639
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,479
changes yeah you know uh nobody knew who

640
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,798
csi was then

641
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,400
nobody knew who fletcher was then

642
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,639
nobody knew who i was that you know i

643
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,480
mean there was people that were known

644
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,320
you know but a lot of them were we were

645
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,319
all in our 20s or whatever just trying

646
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,279
to figure out you know various aspects

647
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,439
of life

648
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,038
yeah you know and we were all learning

649
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
and trading from each other and seeing

650
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,759
what was up and it was uh you know it

651
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,158
was just days of and there also wasn't a

652
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,720
bunch of money or rep involved

653
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,880
yeah it was kind of like the last era

654
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,360
before that era started

655
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,840
yeah it was so we were all young

656
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,599
innocent and dumb and you know and all

657
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,319
that kind of stuff but and

658
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,558
less of a competitive nature maybe yeah

659
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,558
we were all i mean honestly

660
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,399
i came home with so many seeds from that

661
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,558
event and i gave away

662
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
you know thousands of seats

663
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,639
yeah for free

664
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
yeah we just traded

665
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,440
yeah oh you've got some sweet tooth by

666
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,519
blockhead from steve

667
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
you know oh give me a hundred of those

yeah it hadn't been monetized yet no one

672
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,600

bunch of money in america selling seats

674

it just didn't exist yet so it was like

677

all these heads each with their

678
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,038

679
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,000
get people you respected to grow your

680
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:33,759
beans

found fire in your weed

685
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,278

687
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,960

good job

690
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,839
and uh

691
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,919
you know and uh yeah in the forum era uh

692
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,000
caleb was white trash redneck or

693
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,159
inspector

694
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,159
now he's csi

695
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,440
yeah who's turf bugs i've never heard of

696
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,240
her

697
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,240
oh my gosh

698
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,120
we're going to bounce around because all

699
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,599
those different things sort of interact

700
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,479
so just to kind of like put a

701
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,199
um

702
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,839
you know ron's parties were where a lot

703
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,919
of us made friendships with each other

704
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,000
um where a lot of us met for the first

705
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,240
time it brought together different

706
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,079
disparate groups of

707
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,720
uh weed heads

708
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,798
yeah from their 20s through their 40s

709
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,679
you know 50s

710
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,278
it went on for a number of years uh it

711
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,120
you know it happened in the in in the

712
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,200
falls there was a lot of fire outdoor

713
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,719
and i should also mention

714
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,759
because this is pretty important to that

715
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,759
era where this is before the urkel

716
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,319
and the and the purple craze really took

717
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:51,119
off yeah and so

718
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,038
um that's really important because

719
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,839
all good weeds still got grown and was

720
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,839
sold

721
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,480
yeah there really hadn't been waves

722
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,639
where it was like get this one cut

723
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,720
yeah and this cut you can sell all of

724
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,480
that that hadn't really happened yet now

725
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,960
i i attribute a lot of that to [ __ ]

726
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,640
jason king too for hyping cuffs up so

727
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,200
[ __ ] hard that era

728
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,120
i mean you know it's it's it's hard i i

729
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,519
don't necessarily attribute it to him i

730
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,678
attribute it to the brokers

731
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,119
sure because i can't i can't talk about

732
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,759
other areas but like in mendo let's say

733
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,519
0405

734

if you wanted to have a 50 lighter and

735
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,639
you wanted to sell every gram of your

736
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,959
weed you grew

737
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,880

752
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,720
these things but

753
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,720
um

754
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,919
what were the all the popular things you

755
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,480
can think of

756

uh brothers grimm was crossed into a

762
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,959
different amount of stuff

763
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,400
yeah um

764
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,000
you know and then you know a bunch of

765
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,759
classics and things like that there were

766
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,839
a little around nikai was still doing

767
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,240
big stuff federation was still doing big

768
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,000
at that time uh people i can answer that

769
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,079
question someone just said where's jason

770
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
king he's on maui uh we'll we'll talk

771
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,798
about that in a minute um because that

772
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
was actually well that'll overlap but it

773
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,158
really was

774
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
it really was like you know you hear

775
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,919
about the legendary harvest festivals

776
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,919
that happened in humboldt or mendo small

777
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,720
little gatherings and stuff

778
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,960
um that's really what it felt like to me

779
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,960
yeah it felt like being able to go to

780
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,240
one of those type of things and

781
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,159
back then

782
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,400
you really just talk shop and weed with

783
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,440
your close group of hermit friends

784
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,919
yeah

785
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,679
so getting to getting to go to like and

786
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,759
hang out with dozens of different people

787
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,880
for three or four days and chat and chat

788
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,599
it up

789
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,440
uh really set the foundations and a lot

790
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,359
of the a lot of the friendships and

791
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,360
stuff uh for later

792
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,240
yeah it really made a big difference i

793
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,240
think

794
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,480
um frank you know friendships were

795
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,359
forged there transfers were made there

796
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,159
but you know ideas of things

797
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,918
yeah

798
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,360
for a lot for a large part of it and i

799
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,559
think like when you started coming in

800
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,839
heavy

801
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,839
like it was all a bunch of that stuff

802
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,199
yes yeah it was still very much around

803
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,359
like when i first started coming in

804
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,360
heavy i was looking for the blue widow

805
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,798
clone i was looking for the the sweet

806
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,319
thing clone i was looking for all that

807
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:45,839
[ __ ] yeah you're looking for all that

808
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,439
and that was like that was everywhere i

809
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,519
mean that was like what everybody had in

810
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,120
clones what they had in flower and hash

811
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,278
and seeds and all these different types

812
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,278
of stuff yeah you know

813
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,038
kyle was there documenting it for high

814
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,278
times although i don't think ron let him

815
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,720
actually made an article about it yeah

816
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,558
because he wanted to keep it like on the

817
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,319
down low and not [ __ ] it up you know

818
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,798
yeah for sure um

819
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,639
but uh but you know it was interesting

820
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,240
and the reason why we're gonna kind of

821
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,399
bounce around all these different types

822
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,359
of stuff is it all overlaps

823
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,558
yeah

824
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,879
right so

825
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,960
um somebody asked about jason king it's

826
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,520
probably a good time to chat about that

827
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,038
a little bit sure so

828
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,798
at that time

829
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,879
uh there was this guy's name's jason

830
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,480
king and he

831
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,919
had this idea

832
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,880
that i'm going to take a bunch of

833
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,720
pictures of famous strains

834
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,559
and then i'm going to write my own super

835
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,240
opinionated blurb about each one of

836
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,398
these things yeah

837
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,679
and he called it the canon

838
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,079
and i don't think anybody knew what he

839
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,399
was doing at the time uh would be would

840
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,079
matter but what he did which is super

841
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,119
cool is he came out with about three can

842
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,278
of bibles

843
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,439
yeah and they sort of document this

844
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:56,079
whole like late 90s through early to

845
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,720
mid-2000s era

846
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,759
right before the clone wars

847
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,159
where all these specific clones of kush

848
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,558
urkel sauer all that started just

849
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,960
dominating and a lot of these random

850
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,000
hybrids started to becoming hard to find

851
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,038
yeah

852
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,839
right

853
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,240
um so he came out with this can of bible

854
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,519
and i remember getting it and uh

855
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,679
one of the coolest things about the

856
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,599
first can of bible was that the entire

857
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,278
first introduction

858
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,879
uh is written by one of my weed heroes

859
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:27,839
uh rob clark

860
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,320
yes

861
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,319
right and rob did rob did this thing

862
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,200
where he wrote this big introduction

863
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,918
into the canon bible which honestly

864
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,080
i'm not sure anyone could have done that

865
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,159
and given as much legitimacy to jason

866
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,519
king

867
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:48,559
ron clark writing a big long seed

868
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,879
history and clone history introduction

869
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:54,558
yeah because like i've said before ron

870
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,559
wrote the bible for rob

871
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,959
rob clark wrote the bible for seed

872
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,159
breeding marijuana botany he wrote

873
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,558
hashish

874
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,320
uh he's legendary he's an encyclopedic

875
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,879
knowledge he's definitely like one of

876
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,278
the elders of the whole marijuana thing

877
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,919
yeah you know uh he's made lasting

878
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,440
contributions to cannabis and so him

879
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,480
writing that and what he did is he

880
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,880
outlined

881
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,839
which strains which was a huge debate

882
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,720
even back then yeah which strains went

883
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,639
to amsterdam as clone onlys

884
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,558
and which strains went to amsterdam as

885
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,120
seedlines yeah

886
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,119
and a timeline of who gave what

887
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,599

888
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,359
over there yeah and then a timeline of

889

versions of things yeah that was one of

892
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,038

00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,960
the right people without an n

968
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,480
yeah yeah it's still kind of that way

969
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,159
for the old school guys though you know

970
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,679
what i mean like but nothing like guys

971
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,679
are hard to talk to but nothing like it

972
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,440
was yeah before you couldn't even find

973
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,759
how to contact an old guy at least now

974
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,759
they have like maybe an ig page or some

975
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,919
some way you can track them down

976
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,519
that's true when i first got into this i

977
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,320
remember i tried tracking down dj's

978
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,319
short to speak to him you know

979
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,079
no dice you had to find where he was

980
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,439
going to be speaking and see him in

981
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,798
person if you wanted to get a hold of

982
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,720

00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,239
on good terms

1014
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,399
um he's a super opinionated guy and he

1015
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,239
used to drive some people nuts

1016
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,679
it very true very true like there are

1017

with him yeah right

1020
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,200
and on top of that i was very

1021
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
sympathetic to what he was trying to do

1022
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,519
yeah just another weed nerd trying to

1023
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,280
[ __ ] put the pieces together yeah i

1024
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,838
strongly disagreed with them about

1025
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,000
certain things oh you know yeah and all

1026
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:12,320
that you know and we would battle about

1027

1035
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,160
documented yeah

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,960
and you know and it was pretty neat in

1089
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,159
that regard um because

1090
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,599

you know they um

1092
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,359
there's a lot of stuff that was like

1093
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,760
that's been lost

1094
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,679
yeah but there's a ton that's in those

1095
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,280
books but there's video but there's

1096
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,039
picture evidence and there's various

1097
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,800
aspects right

1098
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,400
and uh

1099
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,560
you know so

1100
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,000
if people are interested because of that

1101
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,000
close relationship

1102
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,358
um i had a bunch of stuff that ended up

1103
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,400
in that book

1104
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,799
um

1105
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,200
the the i grew the dog both i was in

1106
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,640
this process then of growing a bunch of

1107
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:53,358
my favorite strains completely organic

1108
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,319
and then full salt

1109
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,159
and

1110
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,838
then in the same room at the same time

1111
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,679
right next to each other and then doing

1112
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,159
a bunch of blind taste tests with me and

1113
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,039
my friends and trying to actually see

1114
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:04,960
yeah

1115
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,920
which is better

1116
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,480
right so i so there's there's uh the

1117
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,440
chem 91 is in there is both dog and chem

1118
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,039
dog

1119
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,599
grown both ways

1120
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,119
uh my mendo perps is in there the snow

1121
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,000
the trinity

1122
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,838
my super dog seven cut that i lost

1123
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,239
is in there which is a hybrid between

1124
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,000
the uh myself and the guy from staten

1125
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,799
island made this line

1126
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,800
basically a super skunk chem dog line

1127
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,760
um the purple effects

1128
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,160
yeah uh which is mendo perps crossed

1129
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,680
with fx which is a cool story

1130
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,440
um

1131
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,919
actually somebody said coral reef that's

1132
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,519
not mine but uh our buddy fletch has

1133
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,519
been hunting for that for a super long

1134
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:49,119
[ __ ] time yeah so if anybody knows

1135
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,719
where the coral reef is uh hit us up

1136
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,880
but anyway like

1137
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,959
that that that um

1138
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,200
that superdog thing is is the odd

1139
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,519
connection that me and you have where i

1140
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,358
spent years and years and years trying

1141
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,920
to figure out who made the [ __ ] super

1142
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,920
dog by asking around the whole kim fam

1143
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,680
all that [ __ ] and at one point i

1144
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,358
couldn't get any [ __ ] answers like

1145
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,480
half half the people would say yes it's

1146
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,358
jesus it's the same thing it's just

1147
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,679
another name you know we made it yeah

1148
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:15,759
it you

1149
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,639
turn out to be that way but i remember

1150
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,599
before we met i remember in 2010 i made

1151
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:23,598
a super dog 2010 trying to recreate

1152
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,519
what i had read about in the canon bible

1153
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,039
because i could never [ __ ] find it

1154
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,719
and many many years later when we

1155
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,639
finally interacted i'd realized you were

1156
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,759
the source of the super dog and that was

1157
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,358
really interesting because it was such a

1158
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
big long chase for me because of that

1159
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,799
book

1160
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,400
i i remember i mean i i don't really

1161
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
want to tell the story of how i lost at

1162
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,400
all but

1163
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,399
um i i remember like i mean i had it at

1164
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,400
all those ron parties i passed it out

1165
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,519
freely to a bunch of people

1166
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,440
um i gave a bunch of superdog hybrids uh

1167
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,440
to mandelbrot

1168
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,280
and it ended up being a lot of the basis

1169
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,119
of a lot of his males

1170
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,200
that he started using to get started

1171
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,838
because even back then everyone had to

1172
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,199
use pollen yeah not that everybody

1173
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,358
doesn't use pollen today but everybody

1174
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,480
had to use like males yeah like full

1175
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:11,039
regular males reversals were

1176
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,920
six seven eight years away yeah

1177
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,358
then um so i i didn't even we didn't

1178
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,000
even know it was but the only reversals

1179
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,239
anyone ever heard of is accidental herms

1180
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,239
yeah that was reversals

1181
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,838
and sometimes if people wanted to make

1182
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:27,279
accidental

1183
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,279
they would torture their plan

1184
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,679
they would make it dry out they would

1185
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,599
make it almost die they would [ __ ] with

1186
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,039
its life cycle they would just capture

1187
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,000
it and see

1188
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,880
can i get it to pop a bunch of pollen

1189
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,838
right

1190
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,720
yeah

1191
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,880
so

1192
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,719
technique yeah like i don't have like i

1193
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,720
lost the super dog i lost the purple

1194
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,799
effects but there's write-ups in that

1195
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:49,598
book of it

1196
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,960
right

1197
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,720
which is pretty neat because then

1198
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,720
there's there's at least pictures of it

1199
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,959
yeah that's how it got documented and

1200
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,719
why we still know about it

1201
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,880
yeah and i should tell i should tell a

1202
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,879
funny story just because so

1203
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,400
uh jason had this girlfriend named

1204
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,680
rebecca back then

1205
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,559
and um

1206
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:11,039
he uh she was from north carolina and

1207
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,358
they had this strain that is is semi

1208
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,279
known right now called the mothership

1209
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,400
yeah and it was this old ass weird

1210
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,920
sativa um and jason just raved and raved

1211
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,639
and raved about it and so he got his

1212
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,720
girlfriend's friends to mail it to him

1213
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,039
in uh in lake county

1214
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,639
yeah right so you're thinking today you

1215
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,239
know with all the mailing tech that

1216
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,199
people have you're thinking some like

1217
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,679
small innocuous package or whatever

1218
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,000
yeah so this this [ __ ] thing shows up

1219
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,799
and it's a box that's about a foot a

1220
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,639
foot

1221
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,440
wide and a foot you know this and two

1222
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,480
feet deep right yeah it's a big [ __ ]

1223
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,519
box

1224
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,119
you know

1225
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,358
and we open it up

1226
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,599
and inside are two mother ships with a

1227
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,960
bunch of with a bunch of stuffing around

1228
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,519
them in one gallon pots tied to stakes

1229
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,800
and they're like they're like 18 to 24

1230
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:01,119
inches tall

1231
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,400
yeah so instead of the person mailing us

1232
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,119
cuts

1233
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,318
they mailed us like one gallon pots of

1234
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,760
dirt and 18 to 24 inch tall plants

1235
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,519
in that box that's all there was you

1236
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,480
open the box and it's like two plants in

1237
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,199
there

1238
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,719
yeah that's wild but it was so unusual i

1239
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,118
think i don't think the post office was

1240
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,039
hip yet to like weed and like especially

1241
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,640
plants in the mail sending big ass

1242
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,159
plants in the mail no probably yeah and

1243
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,400
there's actually in that can of bible

1244
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:28,239
there's some uh there's some pictures of

1245
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,400
that mother ship because i was one of

1246
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:31,759
the first people that grew it um because

1247
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,039
i actually had running grow rooms and

1248
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,040
there's pictures of the mother ship at

1249
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,719
eddie lep's property there's pictures of

1250
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,838
the mother ship from my greenhouses and

1251
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,759
stuff it was a really unusual plant but

1252
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,519
but yeah it got mailed to us in the most

1253
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,480
sketch way imaginable

1254
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,400
i remember

1255
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,800
in cana bible if i think it was the

1256
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,400
mother ship that at one point jason king

1257
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,240
was trying to say this has to be related

1258
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,480
to hp13 because i've never tasted

1259
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,919
anything like this that was one of those

1260
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,000
extreme speculations that he was uh i

1261
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,440
mean i should say i mean he's my friend

1262
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,358
and everything like that but yeah you

1263
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,960
read the descriptions of like the dog

1264
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,838
and the chem dog and different things

1265
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,599
yeah and i even wrote down like lineage

1266
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,679
in history for him

1267
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,200
and then when he went to do his artistic

1268
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,879
interpretation of what he wanted to

1269
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,358
write you read it and you're like oh

1270
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,680
that's [ __ ] yeah oh well

1271
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,279
oh well but that happens all the time

1272
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,519
people talk about all this journalist

1273
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,720
quoted me incorrectly or took me out of

1274
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,960
context or whatever else so but at least

1275
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,000
that's a documentation and it was there

1276
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,880
yeah

1277
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,599
you know

1278
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,800
um and well so one thing i'll say and

1279
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,519
then we'll move on and we'll talk a

1280
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,560
little bit about eddie's situation right

1281
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,119
is that

1282
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,000
um so we did that

1283
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,000
uh

1284
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,880
i'm gonna lose my train of thought but

1285
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,800
um jason decided to do a can of bible

1286
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,800
release party

1287
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,880
for the second can of bible and he

1288
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,800
decided to invite everyone that it

1289
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,720
contributed to the book

1290
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,039
with pictures right and everyone that

1291
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,719
helped him put together and who's who

1292
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,838
and um

1293
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,598
they uh

1294
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,279
and he rented out this very this very

1295
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,559
magical place which i don't know if most

1296
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,359
people have heard of there's this place

1297
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:12,318
called or springs in mendocino county

1298
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,679
and it's a natural hot springs um and

1299
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,679
you know so it's got all these like

1300
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,598
cabins in the woods and stuff and all

1301
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,598
this beautiful redwood and it's right

1302
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,960
next to monkey huh

1303
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,280
no i'm saying yes

1304
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,358
and it's right next to montgomery woods

1305
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,800
which has some of the tallest trees in

1306
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,400
the world

1307
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,160
right i think three out of the five

1308
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,400
tallest redwoods are all

1309
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,639
in mendocino county right next to this

1310
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,960
this hot springs yeah so it's pretty

1311
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,759
magical place right

1312
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,280
so

1313
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,640

1318
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,479

00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,318
well i don't know if they pop yeah

1490
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:24,880
right

1491
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:28,000
and so i just remember

1492
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,680
like walking away from there and uh

1493
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,760
just being like just i just thought i

1494
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,039
was gonna get a wealth of information

1495
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,119
yeah

1496
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,719
and in the hours and hours that i talked

1497
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,519
to them i don't i don't even know if i

1498
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,358
got

1499
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,280
too many tidbits

1500
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,440
yeah no

1501
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,720
you know and then if you read his book

1502
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,760
now it's gonna sound like i'm dissing

1503
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,279
him it is a very very rudimentary way of

1504
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,680
growing inside

1505
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,359
it is yeah definitely now the one thing

1506
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,358
i will say that i think is super cool

1507
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:56,799
about his book is he does describe a

1508
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:58,639
bunch of uh

1509
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,480
uh weed that he smoked when he was

1510
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,358
younger that's my favorite part of the

1511
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,280
book

1512
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,519
and then he also does this thing

1513
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,440
where he has this i mean we didn't

1514
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,838
no one used the word terpenes back then

1515
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,200
but he tried to make like an olfactory

1516
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:15,759
chart yeah like a smells chart and break

1517
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:18,480
down what smells are related to what

1518
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,720
yeah is a really good chart and it was a

1519
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,960
fantastic chart i highly recommend it

1520
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,879
still because anything that trains you

1521
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,079
to speak about things in language is

1522
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,760
helpful yeah

1523
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,559
yeah so i mean he was talking about like

1524
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,319
squirrel cage fans and you know i mean

1525
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,720
that's kind of like you know he kind of

1526
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:38,318
grew in trailers and organ and

1527
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:40,719
and use that used very 80s tech and

1528
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:42,000
never really advanced right

1529
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,879
um

1530
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,039
but be that as it may despite being very

1531
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,920
disappointed by talking to them about

1532
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:52,800
things i still bought like 400 450 of

1533
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,039
the seats yeah every line he had the

1534
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,318
velvet the moonshine the blueberry the

1535
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:01,519
flow i bought you know i don't know 75

1536
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:04,000
to 150 of them yeah right

1537
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,280
um and i and i i went home and i grew

1538
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,358
them all out

1539
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,599
yeah um i think is the name of the book

1540
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,920
is like cultivating exceptional cannabis

1541
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,280
or something like that yeah that's it

1542
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,519
right off the top of my head something

1543
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,519
like that it's got a really pretty flow

1544
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:19,039
plant or something on the cover yeah

1545
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:20,559
extremely purple

1546
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,079
i think it's a flow but some other

1547
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,280
people have said it's a blue satellite

1548
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,359
too like there's some some discrepancies

1549
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,680
on that as well well one of the things i

1550
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,558
mean when you interviewed uh chimera and

1551
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,960
red

1552
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,559
yeah you know um you know one of the

1553
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,159
things that chimera is good friends with

1554
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,319
dj so he's not going to say anything

1555
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,920
rude but what he did say is he kind of

1556
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,000
basically admitted that he thought that

1557
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,880
everything that he had was like the same

1558
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,960
line

1559
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,760
yeah and it was just different express

1560
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,920
like

1561
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,599
dj would see an expression within the

1562
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,240
line and he would be like oh this is its

1563
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,318
own thing it's blue velvet yeah and if i

1564
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,159
just breed stuff with expressions like

1565
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:58,079
that it's its own thing

1566
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,799
but that's not really what was going on

1567
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,240
either because he was crossing opposite

1568
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,039
to to

1569
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,799
opposite when he was doing line breeding

1570
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,440
working directional which is what you

1571
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,599
don't do it was very artistic take on

1572
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,679
breeding for the time and he and and in

1573
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,000
fairness like we said before i they were

1574
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,759
writing the book as they were going you

1575
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,920
know like these were guys just getting

1576
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,160
into kind of reading there was no books

1577
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,079
to be had you know at the time when dj

1578
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,000
was doing this so mad props to him for

1579
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,839
[ __ ] doing what he did i i was able

1580
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,519
to

1581
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:31,759
uh work at the bunch of his work that

1582
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:35,679
i'm stoked on um i'm not as stoked on

1583
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:37,359
his uh human work um as far as

1584
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,440
human breeding but other than that you

1585
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:41,440
know like as far as cannabis breeding i

1586
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,119
i owe a big debt of gratitude to him i

1587
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,039
mean i'm not but i just you know it's

1588
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,838
one of those like he

1589
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:49,679
that's the conundrum right is that it is

1590
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:51,279
you see all this amazing stuff you see

1591
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,358
how it all works you get it yourself and

1592
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,240
i grew up imagine people listening i

1593
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,358
grew out 450 seeds over the next year

1594
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:00,159
yeah

1595
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:00,159
and uh

1596
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:04,639
you know i'd like to say i found a few

1597
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,240
keepers that i i miss

1598
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,598
yeah i did

1599
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:11,199
yeah i did i it it was unbelievably

1600
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,720
beautiful a lot of it

1601
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,358
especially pre-cookie there was

1602
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,919
lavenders there was blues there was pink

1603
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:19,679
there was purple there was various

1604
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,639
shades of in-between

1605
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:25,199
it didn't have a lot of terps

1606
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,519
and it didn't have a very potent high

1607
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,318
most of it yeah yeah for sure um but

1608
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:32,880
when i outcrossed it to different things

1609
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:34,639
i got way better weed

1610
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,559
than anything of the pure lines i got

1611
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:38,000
from him so you can imagine how [ __ ]

1612
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,319
excited i am right because now there's

1613
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,798
no seed bank there's no middleman it's

1614
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,798
like i'm getting handwritten manila

1615
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:49,280
envelopes from the guy

1616
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,280
yeah the real deal holyfield

1617
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,798
am i gonna find the fire yeah here it

1618
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,358
comes right

1619
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:59,039
real [ __ ] labeling backing everything up

1620
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,400
i mean you know how it goes when you're

1621
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,960
running hundreds of things and you want

1622
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,760
to keep track of it what the [ __ ]

1623
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,679
yep

1624
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,559
you know it's uh it's a huge pain in the

1625
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:08,318
ass

1626
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,519
yeah i just recently did that i mean

1627
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:11,920
people were talking about you know

1628
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:14,318
popping 450 seeds in the in the chat not

1629
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,039
finding anything i just recently popped

1630
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:20,719
almost the same amount of uh

1631
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,400
stuff from from uh blue lines and uh

1632
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,639
went through all of it and had a very

1633
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,240
similar experience now i i will say

1634
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,639
something because there is some there is

1635
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:31,279
like a an economic aspect that we don't

1636
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:34,159
talk about right where back then

1637
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,798
um you know most fire indoor was you

1638
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:39,598
know four to forty five hundred

1639
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:42,318
yeah a peak yeah so

1640
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,160
it was really easy to grow flower

1641
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,838
and have a side room or two with a

1642
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,598
couple of lights in each

1643
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:48,400
for experimentation

1644
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,880
yeah

1645
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,798
you know the the rate you know a 12

1646
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,880
lighter could was was everything you

1647
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:55,599
need in life if you wanted to

1648
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,079
so

1649
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,760
uh the economics were really easy to

1650
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,720
allow people to experiment and [ __ ]

1651
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,960
around

1652
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,879
yeah now things are super tight and it's

1653
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,720
gotten quite hard and mathematics and

1654
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,960
economics are much more difficult right

1655
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,199
in this particular period of time

1656
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,720
yeah um but back then

1657
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,879
you know it was like that's what kept

1658
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,558
the cropping from being boring

1659

00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:38,719
recognizable character

1672
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:40,960
yeah

1673
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:42,239
you know yeah you wouldn't have even if

1674
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,679
you didn't become friends with him or

1675
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,000

to i don't want to break it up but we'll

1679
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:53,039
get to that um when we talk about the

1680
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,760
authenticity part in a little bit here

1681
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,279
yeah sure um as far as that goes because

1682
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,799
there's a bunch of people that one of

1683
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,119
the things about cannabis i'll talk

1684
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,119
about super briefly is that you can just

1685
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,119
sort of step out of the shadows

1686
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,039
yeah and then people are like i don't

1687
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,358
believe where this person came from if

1688
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,440
i'm i'm i'm who i am i would have known

1689
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:12,558
him yeah

1690
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,200
you know

1691
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,960
um so you know it's it's one of those

1692
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,558
things where uh

1693
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,000
there's a lot of shady characters in

1694
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,280
cannabis

1695
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,920
and there's a lot of and there's a lot

1696
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,519
of people who make good and bad opinions

1697
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,960
about people on the internet that you

1698
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,119
have never met and you don't hang out

1699
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,039
with in real life yeah

1700
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,838
you know matt and i are friends in real

1701
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:32,719
life

1702
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:34,719
yes

1703
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,000
you know like we're real life friends

1704
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,879
we've made

1705
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,358
made real love to each other so uh you

1706
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,119
know platonically from a distance

1707
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:45,119
you know all that

1708
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,640
um but you know it it's different and

1709
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,119
you have a bunch of people who become

1710
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:50,960
fanboys or girls of different people

1711
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,559
and attack whoever they want to and

1712
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,000
stuff like that you know and it becomes

1713
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,880
difficult because they don't know their

1714
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,559
enemy

1715
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,440
and they don't know their friend

1716
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,319
yes

1717
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,559
either

1718
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:03,279
they know like a a social media

1719
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,640
construct of that person sure which is

1720
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,519
not the same thing

1721
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,440
no

1722
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,199
so but we'll get to that in a bit so

1723
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,720
scrolling back you've got you've got

1724
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,439
ron's parties

1725
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:15,358
right yeah uh being sort of a nexus for

1726
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,280
this thing you've got uh

1727
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,440
you've got the can of bible parties

1728
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,880
which were another nexus bringing people

1729
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,440
together you know

1730
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,760
um yeah but i was i have to say i was

1731
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,960
super disappointed because i really feel

1732
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,599
like

1733
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,920
you know if you take home 450 seeds from

1734
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,599
four different lines from a breeder and

1735
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,000
uh you don't find anything you really

1736
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,559
think or one i want to keep you know

1737
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,400
yeah that's super disappointing

1738
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,559
yeah that it is disappointing that's a

1739
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,000
lot of money so it's a lot of my i mean

1740
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,760
he gave me a good deal don't get me

1741
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,760
wrong it's not like i paid full custody

1742
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,880
because i'm at the no he liked to make

1743
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,599
money too

1744
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,760
but yeah but the the size of the room

1745
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,599
the amount of just everything that goes

1746
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,000
into the economics is growing it's a lot

1747
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,599
of money it's a lot of time

1748
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,119
and you know like i talked before it was

1749
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,960
like you know there's there's eight or

1750
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:07,760
ten american elites of nl5 hayes yeah i

1751
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,880
ran 60 70 no 5as and didn't find any of

1752
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,559
those keepers yeah but other people did

1753
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,798
yeah you know

1754
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,519
um so dj was a disappointment just in

1755
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:20,000
the sense that he comes from like a

1756
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,719
different generation of weed nerd i

1757
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,318
think yeah where they're just not that

1758
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,159
deep into detail

1759
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:28,558
yeah you know i mean one thing you can

1760
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:29,679
say about rob clark or sam skunk man

1761
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,440
it's whether or not you want to believe

1762
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,039
a bunch of what they say or not they're

1763
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,358
heavy on detail

1764
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,880
yeah a lot of the old a lot of the old

1765
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:39,598
guys you talk to

1766
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,599
um you know they're light on detail

1767
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,760
yeah they don't remember or they try to

1768
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,000
make it up they did it

1769
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,359
yeah but they just don't like it's even

1770
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,880
the same thing with like the sour

1771
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:50,318
stories or a lot of stuff that happened

1772
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,480
in the 90s that we try to get to the

1773
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:55,039
bottom of yeah they didn't know it was

1774
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,880
going to be important

1775
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,880
i'm pretty sure dj thought he was always

1776
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,240
going to be important based on having

1777
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,680
met him i'm pretty sure he always

1778
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:03,279
believed he was going to be yeah i mean

1779
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,199
like i said over that weekend i probably

1780
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,440
talked to him for five six hours seven

1781
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,199
hours yeah we were there for three days

1782
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,200
all we were doing was like

1783
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,279
literally smoking weed and hanging out

1784
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:14,480
and shooting the [ __ ] eating food

1785
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,000
dude i would have loved to have had that

1786
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,199
opportunity with him i just it just

1787
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,760
seemed so

1788
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:22,159
not interested in discussing anything

1789
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,160
with me and it was it was it was hard

1790
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,558
because i did look up to him so much and

1791
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:28,798
it's not that i lost respect for him but

1792
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:30,480
it's just like the more i learned about

1793
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:34,079
breeding and

1794
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,920
hands-on the more i learned about

1795
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,519
why his lines turned out the way they

1796
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,318
did and why i was having such a hard

1797
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,960
time

1798
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:43,599
working those lines you know um it all

1799
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,760
made sense in the end and i mean you

1800
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,519
know i don't i'm not dissing him because

1801
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,760
like you're [ __ ] around the 70s or

1802
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,559
80s or even in the 90s or whatever it's

1803
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,880
like

1804
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,280
you learn as you go you know you

1805
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,200
bottleneck something when it's early on

1806
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,119
and that's what you got

1807
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:01,039
yeah you know i i'm not dissing him by

1808
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:03,039
any means because there's a lot like i

1809
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,558
said there's i think his lines are

1810
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,480
overly inbred

1811
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,880
yeah but definitely over the embryo but

1812
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,599
some of the most fireweed at those ron

1813
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,559
parties was out crosses of blue blue

1814
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,240
work

1815
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,160
yeah so there's nothing wrong with

1816
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:17,759
having an inbred kind of unique to the

1817
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,759
cannabis scene line

1818
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,920
and it takes some outcrossing to really

1819
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,680
bring out its true character

1820
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,519
no that's kind of what what breeders

1821
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:26,879
would want something very stable and

1822
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,719
worked you know i don't think that's a

1823
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,519
diss necessary now of course how do i

1824
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,879
wish

1825
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,119
that dj would have repopulated his juicy

1826
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,280
tie and his purple tie and his original

1827
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,318
lines every four or five years and kept

1828
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,240
fresh seed of the original things

1829
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:43,679
yeah sure of course i do do i wish he

1830
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:45,199
was interested in them and didn't just

1831
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:46,000
let them go to [ __ ] even though he had

1832
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:46,798
them

1833
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,559
yeah

1834
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:50,798
well yeah i do

1835
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,079
um but you know i mean everybody looks

1836
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:54,159
back on when they were younger and was

1837
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,920
like boy do i wish i did this

1838
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:58,000
yeah yeah i mean who doesn't have those

1839
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,358
regrets about their 20s

1840
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,599
yeah you know i don't even remember what

1841
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,440
happened in my 20s so right so shit's

1842
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,559
[ __ ] up you know and

1843
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,000
so so that's happening um all these kind

1844
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,480
of bible things are happening they're

1845
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,199
all getting documented in that regard

1846
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,639
and eddie leps was another

1847
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:17,199
place that was kind of like ron's

1848
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:19,519
parties or the cannabis parties where

1849
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,598
um people overlapped a bunch

1850
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:23,759
yeah because people wanted to come out

1851
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:26,240
and see this guy is growing a thousand

1852
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,000
pounds in his front yard

1853
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,479
yeah holy [ __ ]

1854
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,119
yeah he's a wild one now

1855
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,639
now it's like it sucks because you know

1856
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,559
uh what happened to him is he ended up

1857
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,798
going to jail for 10 him and his wife

1858
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,000
ended up going to jail for 10 years

1859
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,000
yeah um

1860
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,318
and you see gardens way bigger than his

1861
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,159
all over the place now yeah and he

1862
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:49,358
didn't people should know this he didn't

1863
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:50,960
just go for it okay he did this crazy

1864
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:52,000
thing this is probably worth mentioning

1865
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,599
where

1866
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,920
the law said you were allowed to have

1867
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:59,039
six plants and a ten by ten

1868
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,639
yeah so he mapped out his farm in ten by

1869
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,400
ten grits

1870
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:04,000
and he collected

1871
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,960
right

1872
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,639
um

1873
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,838
you know he collected medical cards for

1874
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,719
each grid

1875
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:12,880
yeah and each medical card was tied to a

1876
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:15,439
specific grid

1877
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,720
yeah and you could give him

1878
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,159
your strains to grow in that grid

1879
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:21,759
and he would do a certain amount of work

1880
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,118
like feed it and water it and this and

1881
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,839
that but like you could come out there

1882
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,599
and do your own de-leafing and your own

1883
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,440
various aspect of different things like

1884
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,359
that you could put in more work

1885
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,200
yeah if you wanted to and really make

1886
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:34,480
your 10 by 10 nice and then there was i

1887
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,000
don't need to get into that part of it

1888
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,880
but there was a split between him and

1889
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,280
you

1890
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,880
yeah you know so honestly it's like he

1891
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,079
didn't just like blow it up and go for

1892
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,358
it

1893
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,839
he literally

1894
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:46,798
had 10 by 10 plots with six plants per

1895
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:48,480
plot

1896
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:50,400
yeah tied to a medical card and he would

1897
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,838
just stack hundreds of them yeah he was

1898
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,838
just challenging the government to

1899
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:55,199
challenge their own

1900
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,038
like little

1901
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,199
gray areas of the law is what he was

1902
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,920
doing pretty punk rock i might do yeah

1903
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:04,159
super punk rock super rebellious and he

1904
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,480
wanted to have eddie left gardens all up

1905
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:08,639
and down the [ __ ] the highway

1906
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,798
yeah he literally felt like most people

1907
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,400
wouldn't be able to grow their own

1908
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:14,239
but why couldn't you come

1909
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,440
bring your medical card to eddie left's

1910
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:18,078
collective

1911
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,599
yeah and grow your own fairly near your

1912
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,119
house where you could go ten to your

1913
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,920
plants on the weekend

1914
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,200
yeah

1915
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,960
you know and what happened to him was he

1916
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,159
he had this huge plot in his front yard

1917
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,838
i'm not gonna dig him out i got some

1918
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,679
posters from him and a bunch of pictures

1919
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:32,798
and stuff but it's too hard to show like

1920
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:35,838
on the thing

1921
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:38,559
um but anyway he

1922
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:40,558
and then the the last year he had

1923
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,400
he decided to get seven acres across

1924
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,920
highway 20 from his house in upper lake

1925
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,358
and he was going to grow about

1926
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:50,318
13 acres of cannabis

1927
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:53,279
yeah dead serious 32 000 plants yeah

1928
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:54,880
that's a lot for the time yeah uh 32 000

1929
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,319
plants all

1930
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,880
documented

1931
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:00,880
right yeah all with all with and i

1932
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,798
begged him not to

1933
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,400
yeah because i was like dude i don't

1934
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:06,719
think the dea i don't think i don't

1935
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,559
think they'll let you get away with it

1936
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,318
like i'm worried like they'll come down

1937
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,280
and they'll bring the hammer down

1938
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:13,119
you know

1939
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,039
um yeah some photos of that are in the

1940
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,640
can of bible 100 there's a whole thing

1941
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,960
on eddie in the can of bible actually

1942
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,480
yeah um you know and and there's

1943
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,639
definitely pictures throughout the can

1944
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,559
of bibles that are from eddie's spot

1945
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:27,838
uh you probably won't recognize him if

1946
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,839
you hadn't been there but anyway um

1947
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:31,358
so i begged him not to do it some other

1948
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:32,639
friends begged him not to do it but

1949
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,078
there was other people that thought he'd

1950
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:36,639
be fired and they were really pushing

1951
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,920
their boundaries yeah they were pushing

1952
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,960
it hard

1953
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,920
um and uh you know he got raided by the

1954
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,720
dea

1955
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,920
it cost him a lot with 32 000 plants you

1956
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:47,519
know and he

1957
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,039
he him and his wife got 10-year

1958
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,798
sentences

1959
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,960
yeah uh 10-year federal federal

1960
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:54,880
sentences and the [ __ ] the the shitty

1961
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,960
thing about federal sentences is that

1962
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,318
you have to serve 85 percent of the time

1963
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,559
it's not like the state where you can

1964
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,400
get off halfway for good behavior

1965
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,920
yeah and him and he was a vietnam vet

1966
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,000
and him and his wife were older his wife

1967
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,599
passed away in prison sadly

1968
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,838
yeah um and then he got out and uh

1969
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,838
you know the world had changed

1970
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:15,920
he went from being this like rebel

1971
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,440
maverick kind of center of attention

1972
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,440
which to be honest he was kind of

1973
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,760
egotistical and he had you know he tried

he spent a ton of time entertaining and

2009
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,960
being himself

that even now like you get so burnt out

2137
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:42,238
by dealing with people you know yeah um

2138
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:43,759
i think the same thing happened to

2139
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,919
sam skunk man

2140
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,920
to some degree oh yeah yeah you know uh

2141
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,079
he was probably nicer and more chill and

2142
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,158
then you get you have to answer the same

2143
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,559
50 questions a billion times and you get

2144
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:57,359
accused of all this [ __ ] and all of a

2145
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,360
sudden you're a cantankerous old man

2146
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,880
yeah it's very easy to fall in that

2147
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:02,880
category

2148
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,880
you know but those guys were all legends

2149
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,079
all heroes to us vic

2150
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,119
tom hill

2151
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:09,279
hempy

2152
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,920
you know uh these were all like leaders

2153
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,519
of the scene you know um and and

2154
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,600
old-timers to us

2155
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:19,360
yeah you know tom's got to be i mean

2156
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,360
tom's got to be 20 years older than me

2157
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,640
i don't know maybe maybe i don't maybe

2158
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:27,039
50s

2159
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,640
you think he's only in his 50s yeah i

2160
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:30,079
think i think you're pretty old actually

2161
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,840
i think you're probably older than him

2162
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:36,399
you're under 60

2163
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,920
yeah you know it's all the oil of olay

2164
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,439
keeps me young

2165
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,119
or whatever but

2166
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,158
the reason why i'm babbling about all

2167
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:43,198
this [ __ ]

2168
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,119
is

2169
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:46,879
it's where a lot of people because there

2170
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,840
was essentially like there was

2171
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,520
essentially like

2172
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:53,360
uh what's the best way to put it maybe

2173
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,719
the best way to put it is that

2174
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:59,119
in the 90s most weed scenes were

2175
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,279
very isolated to themselves

2176
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:03,359
to very small circles it was very risky

2177
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:04,880
it was illegal everywhere no one was

2178
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:07,359
really chatting

2179
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,199
the grateful dead dead tour fish tour

2180
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:11,039
that kind of thing there was some

2181
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:11,919
overlapping things because people would

2182
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:13,679
meet

2183
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,399
and not be as scared because nobody knew

2184
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,560
where anybody else lived yeah

2185
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:22,479
no i'm not dude i'm 45. matt's joking

2186
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:25,039
960. he's lying i'm 40 i'm 45. no i'm

2187
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:26,639
definitely not 16. definitely not

2188
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:28,000
um

2189
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,840
you know but

2190
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,319
but you know i mean and i'll say the

2191
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,920
same thing too because i just saw uh on

2192
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:35,679
my buddy who i was talking to earlier

2193
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,679
today uh skunk the

2194
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,920
skunk vas on the thing right

2195
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,960
i go to ron's party and i am so hoping

2196
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,520
to meet

2197
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,119
all these legendary people and strains

2198
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,800
and [ __ ] and i'm like just hoping to get

2199
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:48,559
hooked up you know

2200
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,239
and not to be a dick but like i felt

2201
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,840
like i had the chem dog and i had the

2202
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:53,439
super skunk and i had the mendo i felt

2203
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,520
like i had the best weed there

2204
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:56,960
yeah i was like i had me that tore

2205
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,640
people's head off

2206
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,399
yeah you know

2207
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,920
and and uh

2208
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,039
you know it's not to be bragging or

2209
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,480
anything like that because it was

2210
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:06,960
literally just the luck of the draw and

2211
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,559
the luck of my friends yeah

2212
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,880
you know um

2213
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,320
and uh and dead tour you know was one of

2214
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,600
those things where

2215
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:15,599
um

2216
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,719
it was it was sort of like a huge weed

2217
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,159
emporium

2218
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,359
yeah and it made a lot of these

2219
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:20,879
connections

2220
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:22,399
and it made a lot of these things that i

2221
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,079
tied in and the whole reason i came out

2222
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,479
to mendocino county

2223
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:29,198
um was because i had a buddy who lived

2224
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:31,759
in ukiah which is in the heart of mendo

2225
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:33,119
um who after 215 past was like dude get

2226
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,159
the [ __ ] out here why are you living in

2227
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:35,920
chicago

2228
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:37,359
yeah so it was literally connections

2229
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,800
from dead tour that like brought me out

2230
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:39,839
here right

2231
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,440
so

2232
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,719
getting back to what i was saying is

2233
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:46,238
that

2234
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:48,158
in northern california and in dead shows

2235
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,399
there was a weed scene

2236
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:51,198
and on the forums it developed a weed

2237
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:52,879
scene

2238
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:55,198
and in the emerald triangle there was

2239
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,520
kind of a weed scene right

2240
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:59,519
and then these parties and these events

2241
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,880
and stuff was sort of like the first

2242
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,640
mixers

2243
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,920
yeah they were the first places where

2244
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:07,760
these scenes started to like overlap

2245
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,279
where the forum scene and the mendo and

2246
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,719
humboldt scenes and the grateful dead

2247
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:12,559
scenes and all these different groups

2248
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,640
that have ties to different circles they

2249
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,320
start like a venn diagram the circles

2250
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,320
start crossing

2251
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,158
yeah and i honestly think that's set up

2252
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,599
kind of everything for the american weed

2253
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:23,920
scene for later

2254
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,440
i think so i really do like none of us

2255
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,279
knew it at the time

2256
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:29,279
no by any means it wasn't like we're

2257
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:31,920
like oh we're here for history you know

2258
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,519
it was just it but it did it was it was

2259
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,520
the merging of things i mean i should

2260
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,440
say even back then this was a few years

2261
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,880
after ron's parties but

2262
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,559
like um

2263
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,480
you know i mentioned the purple effects

2264
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,760
that's in the uh that's in the can of

2265
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:45,119
bible

2266
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,320
maybe i should talk about that for a

2267
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:47,840
second because people might be

2268
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,079
interested in that

2269
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,719
uh the purple the purple part of purple

2270
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:55,840
effects is just mendo perks right yes

2271
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,039
and the effects was this old garlic

2272
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,640
blood strain

2273
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:02,479
that i got from uh the head grower who

2274
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,800
worked for tim blake

2275
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:07,599
yeah now tim blake now is very famous

2276
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,920
because he's the founder of emerald cup

2277
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,480
but back then he was just a big uh

2278
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,520
guerrilla outdoor indoor

2279
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:16,079
farmer

2280
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,400
yeah and his his main worker was about

2281
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:20,079
my age they are the purple effects and

2282
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:21,599
they gave me the effects which was a

2283
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:25,840
super golden

2284
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:27,039
gorgeous frosty terpe thing right yeah

2285
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,719
and uh

2286
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,279
you know there wasn't any reversals but

2287
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,399
how the the purple effects got made

2288
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,479
um

2289
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:36,479
in the can of bible is that

2290
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:37,519
i had a system that got a little

2291
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,279
stressed because i had an air

2292
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,880
conditioner issue and it took me a few

2293
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:43,759
days to get it fixed

2294
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,440
and you know as as csi will tell you you

2295
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:49,280
stress the mendo perps and the [ __ ]

2296
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,960
will harm yeah right so the mendo perps

2297
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,639
hermed all over the effects that was

2298
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,239
right next to it

jesus 800 to a thousand i mean at the

2302
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,560
time we were hella pissed and the reason

2303
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,560
we got that many was because we had like

2304
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,280
these six or seven you know quarter

2305

2309
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,520
seed

2310
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:17,679
but we cracked this thing and it ends up

2311
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,960
being super terpy

2312
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,560
um

2313
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,719

the can of bible it was gorgeous weed

2315

um and you know i should say that

2316
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,480
there's been some battles amongst the

2317
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,879

2343
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:21,359
his nickname

2344
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:23,439

you know and all that and stuff and so

2346
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:27,678
you know he ended up getting the purple

2347
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:29,678
effects from me and and that's who the

2348
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,640
you know tony mendo and those guys got

2349
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,399
it from

2350
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,840
yeah and it got blended into skittles

2351
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:36,719
and it got got all these different

2352
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,880
things you know and it lives today

2353
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:41,198
yeah you know uh now but that was a

2354
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,359
total that was before femmes that was

2355
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:46,079
literally an unintentional

2356
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:47,759
fuck-up uh where in summertime the ac

2357
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:49,920
went out for two days

2358
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,679
yeah and you know it got hot and then i

2359
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,679
put a new ac in and everything was good

2360
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,880
and then the mendo p just threw through

2361
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,279
pollen

2362
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,480
yeah and i had a and i had a feminized

2363
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,840
cross

2364
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,238
um people are asking what about

2365
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,719
california black rose as far as i know

2366
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:06,158
it's the same thing same thing um so

2367
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,560
what happened to them

2368
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:11,119
is like a lot of cannabis terms

2369
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,520
uh rose is trademarked

2370
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:14,399
yeah rose is a very specific kind of

2371
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,080
wine

2372
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:17,920
and there's also another

2373
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:20,158
c company that has a totally different

2374
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:22,079
line called rose as well relentless and

2375
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:23,519
that's not related to i don't think it's

2376
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:24,960
related to the same diamond greek one

2377
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,800
but uh don't quote me now that i think

2378
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,960
about i don't know but it was very

2379
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,880
different so they had to change it uh

2380
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,760
because they got because as you get

2381
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,279
legal

2382
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,039
and you start entering these things and

2383
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:36,880
stuff you start getting sued

2384
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,960
yeah you know girl scout cookies and

2385
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,960
thin mint is cookies because they got

2386
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,279
[ __ ] sued by the girl scouts

2387
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,880
yeah you know the reason why skittles

2388
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:46,719
has z's

2389
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,199
yeah you know is they're trying to skate

2390
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,640
around these these trademark laws right

2391
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:53,439
so

2392
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:56,719
rose is russian og

2393
01:19:53,439 --> 01:20:00,238
crossed with skittles that's the z

2394
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:02,239
across the purple effects that's the e

2395
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:03,678
and it took second place i don't know

2396
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:04,799
three four years ago or whatever at the

2397
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,440
emerald coast

2398
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,199
so what i got out of them and this this

2399
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,238
one's been i think i have a screenshot

2400
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:14,638
of it there's russian kush oz kush

2401
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,959
effects cross back to skittles is the

2402
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:18,719
claim yeah something like yeah yeah so

2403
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,719
it's getting close to that but they had

2404
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,719
the the seeds that they had were purple

2405
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,600
effect seeds from from fuzzy that was

2406
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,439
from me

2407
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,560
yeah because back then it was like there

2408
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:30,079
wasn't any

2409
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:32,159
i mean in this same time frame um i

2410
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:33,679
should say this too but you know uh my

2411
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,799
buddy from uh

2412
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:39,279
me and and uh uh skunk va's old friend

2413
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,279
who um with the chems and stuff we were

2414
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:43,279
working on these superdog projects

2415
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:45,279
together and crossing them to all kinds

2416
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:46,479
of different hybrids and and clone only

2417
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:48,960
as we had

2418
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:51,119
um and my buddy mandelbrot

2419
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,279
uh at the time who wasn't into seeds or

2420
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:54,800
breeding wanted to get started with weed

2421
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:57,119
and i ended up giving him a bunch of

2422
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,880
seeds and a bun and some clones to get

2423
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:00,719
him started on this project and he ended

2424
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,719
up becoming pretty well known

2425
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,560
um some of the stuff he got famous for

2426
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,560
was based off that work some of it was a

2427
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,719
little different from different things

2428
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,400
yeah um but the

2429
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:13,039
the reason i brought that up isn't to

2430
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:15,198
like lay claim it's to say that back

2431
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:16,238
then we were very free with trading

2432
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,079
things

2433
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:19,359
yeah because no one ever thought that

2434
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:21,760
they could come out of the woodwork and

2435
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:22,799
lay claim to anything yeah

2436
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,639
yeah right

2437
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,480
yeah that wasn't a worry

2438
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:29,199
now it's all like [ __ ] you you can't

2439
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:31,519
breed with my my cut that's mine that's

2440
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:32,879
my seed line i want matt knows this more

2441
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,880
than me because

2442
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,719
um i i've avoided so far a lot of the

2443
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,319
weed politics by giving away a bunch of

2444
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,039
seeds for free

2445
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:43,759
yeah and when you sell seeds like matt

2446
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:45,760
uh you end up getting you know i want

2447
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,119
half the seeds because you use my cut in

2448
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,920
this one cross

2449
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:51,599
i want rep i want you to mention me i

2450
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,039
want you to give me money

2451
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,719
uh it's my [ __ ] you don't have

2452
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:56,560
permission

2453
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,639
so many blow jobs i've had to give just

2454
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,800
because of seeds it's not fair it's not

2455
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,880
fair yeah it's not you know i mean do

2456
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,960
what you love do what you love so that's

2457
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,239
what i'm good at so yeah yeah i mean so

2458
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,840
there you know there's an aspect of

2459
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:11,519
politics but this was before that

2460
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,119
politics yeah people just swapped seeds

should give credit you know i mean i

2496
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,840
just saw uh homie mentioned that people

2497
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:27,920
should give credit you should say that i

2498
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,719
got this from this person you know you

2499
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:33,039
also should um if you got a cut from

2500
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,480
somebody um you should give it back to

2501
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:36,000
them if they lose it

2502
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:38,399
yeah that's really good etiquette you

2503
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,760
know um i've had multiple things that

2504
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,519
i've lost

2505
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,440
and i've tried to get back from people i

2506
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,199
i mentioned the purple effects that's

2507
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:47,839
one of them that exists i can't get it

2508
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:50,799
back without trading other things for it

2509
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,719
yeah which i think is uh super shady and

2510
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,039
a breach of the code

2511
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:57,279
at least the code when i came up

2512
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:59,119
um you're definitely supposed to

2513
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:01,119
do that there's some honor i mean half

2514
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,880
the reason people trade things is so you

2515
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,198
don't lose things

2516
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,480
yeah because angry girlfriend angry

2517
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:09,519
boyfriend bust fire landlord moving

2518
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:10,559
accident

2519
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,440
whatever

2520
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,440
you know

2521
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:14,960
all those different types of things

2522
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:16,719
um

2523
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,719
you know you you trade things back

2524
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,319
amongst people you know yeah i mean one

2525
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,679
of the reasons you know i'll say this

2526
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:23,759
because he's because he's listening or

2527
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:26,560
whatever but i mean one of the reasons

2528
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,880
why the chem 91 didn't get lost

2529
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,199
yeah was because there was a tight group

2530
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:34,400
of uh you know four or five of us

2531
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:36,399
myself uh skunk va i see collective my

2532
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,638
buddy from staten island who all had it

2533
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:42,238
and all lived in norcal

2534
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:43,920
and you know we all kept it alive

2535
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:45,519
you know people sometimes people got in

2536
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,880
trouble some people had to move

2537
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,480
sometimes you had to get back from

2538
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,319
somebody or whatever

2539
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:51,439
and it was like we were all heavily

2540
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:54,479
invested

2541
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:56,719
in making sure these things lived

2542
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,399
you know yeah i mean that's that's why a

2543
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:00,079
lot of these cuts are still in our group

2544

you know so i just i just thought it

2680
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:31,839
would be it would be cool because this

2681
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:33,119
era is like right before kind of matt

2682
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,000
came into things

2683
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:36,000
yeah

2684
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,119
which is like i apologize because i keep

2685
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,679
trying to get

2686
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:41,599
uh shows done where i make it like more

2687
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,239
matt's era than mine

2688
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:46,239
um because there's my arrows were like

2689
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:47,759
smaller then

2690
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:49,039
there's an era where like you know i was

2691
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,639
having a bunch of kids and had some

2692
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:52,960
issues or whatever and

2693
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:55,039
and matt was super engaged

2694
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,198
uh when i was a little less engaged but

2695
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:59,600
so far i you know i'm gonna drag him

2696
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:01,439
kicking and screaming into his era

2697
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,199
where it's mostly him talking and me

2698
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:05,039
shutting up but he keeps making us do

2699
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:07,279
these things where it's it's a little

2700
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:09,279
older stuff

2701
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:11,039
yeah i think i think it's a lot too

2702
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:12,960
because i've been you know doing the

2703
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:14,319
live feed for a long time and i think

2704
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:16,158
for

2705
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,840
this many years i think people are more

2706
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:20,719
excited to hear from someone else for a

2707
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,639
bit and i i'm excited to hear like from

2708
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,719
an era i wasn't a part of and i think

2709
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:26,159
nobody gives a [ __ ] to hear what i have

2710
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,079
to say about something i wasn't a part

2711
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:30,479
of and i don't either so i think it's

2712
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:32,158
it's it's not just about my ego on this

2713
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:34,079
thing i think it's good to to get all

2714
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:35,920
aspects of history on here and you know

2715
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:38,719
there's a thing too where it's like i

2716
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:41,119
mean we didn't know back in the day

2717
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,158
that the chem dog was gonna become super

2718
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:45,198
famous

2719
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:47,119
uh yeah it stayed alive um because our

2720
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:48,559
buddy from staten island used to take it

2721
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:50,559
to

2722
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,159
like you could meet him outside of any

2723
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,239
jerry show outside the war field and

2724
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:57,599
probably buy a 400 ounce

2725
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:58,399
yeah you know um you know all that you

2726
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,079
could

2727
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,439
uh you know

2728
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:06,639
um when's when jerry garcia died you

2729
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:08,879
know um and he decided to and and you

2730
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:10,639
know skunk va came back to california

2731
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,000
you know he got cuts from homie and he

2732
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:13,760
started he started growing because all

2733
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,760
of a sudden he was settled down

2734
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,880
he wasn't traveling and seeing shows and

2735
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,719
stuff and that's where some of his

2736
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,600
polaroids come from of that old skunk

2737
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,679
cut

2738
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,520
you know and you know small group of us

2739
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:24,880
were growing the dog and we were always

2740
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,280
we called it you know no one called the

2741
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,520
chem 91 and all that that's all like

2742
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:32,719
later we all called it the dog

2743
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,639
yeah and you know uh skunk va and our

2744
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:36,880
buddy from staten island they mostly

2745
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,639
grew organic um so they didn't want to

2746
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,560
call their weed chem

2747
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:41,600
yeah they weren't gonna call it the chem

2748
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,360
dog

2749
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,960
i think that picture i think that

2750
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:45,839
picture of the super skunk for me at

2751
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,520
least

2752
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,039
and what i'm interested in is one of the

2753
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,639
most important pictures that anybody

2754
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:52,399
could have kept that and some of the

2755
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,239
josh dog pictures

2756
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:57,119
um yeah those are specifically the

2757
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:59,759
shower picture and or pictures of sour

2758
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:01,599
pictures the old super skunk super super

2759
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,639
[ __ ] important for solving that weird

2760
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,639
mystery of like was this super skunk cut

2761
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:08,800
the same as the original super skunk cut

2762
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:11,760
that was hard that was hard to figure

2763
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,279
out yeah and uh that helped a lot i mean

2764
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,440
there's a thing too like part of the you

2765
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:16,880
know we don't need to go over it again

2766
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:19,119
um but we'll talk about it just really

2767
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:21,359
briefly we were talking about like ron's

2768
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:23,599
parties and these and the triangle and

2769
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:26,719
the dead scene and all that i mean the

2770
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,719
whole reason that the francine um got

2771
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:31,359
taken out east and you know the super

2772
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:33,600
skunk came west and all that stuff was

2773
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:36,479
all because of jerry shows

2774
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,679
yeah that our friend and and skunk va

2775
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:39,599

smoking weed together at the show and

2778
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,359

2780
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:48,880

2782
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,960
pretty eloquently and stuff like that

2783
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:54,799
but it is it is showing how those

2784
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,480
circles overlapped

2785
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,639
yeah you know and one led to the other

2786
01:32:56,479 --> 01:33:01,198
and stuff like that you know and so

2787

2794
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:14,639
chat again this weekend i have a i have

2795
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,480
a line on something i thought was long

2796
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:18,800
lost that's dear to both of our hearts

2797
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:20,959
so i'm trying my damnedest to make sure

2798
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,920
i can get it back to all of us uh yeah

2799
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,760
we'll see

2800
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:26,480
you know and i do believe

2801
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,400
i'm not particularly uh

2802
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:30,399
uh superstitious

2803
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:32,479
um yeah but i do believe in in the

2804
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:34,238
energy of the plant and i do believe in

2805
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:36,718
the universe a bit like making things

2806
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:37,919
come to you and i can say for everyone

2807
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,158
out there

2808
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,000
uh for me at least the number one way

2809
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:43,439
that you get the cuts that you want and

2810
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,760
you get the things that you want in

2811
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:46,960
cannabis is by treating the plant the

2812
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,159
right way and having the right

2813
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,920
intentions

2814
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:51,439
yeah

2815
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,039
that's what i say because that that's

2816
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:55,039
going to a long term that's going to get

2817
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:56,479
the right people to trust you

2818
01:33:55,039 --> 01:33:58,399
yeah and that's going to lead to what

2819
01:33:56,479 --> 01:33:59,599
you want and i do believe the plant has

2820
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:02,079
an energy

2821
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:03,199
and i do believe the plant wants to uh

2822
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:05,119
wants to

2823
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:06,879
um you know

2824
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:08,079
wants to find people that'll keep it

2825
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,560
safe

2826
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:12,880
i agree i really do i don't know there's

2827
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,400
not i can't prove it obviously but i

2828
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,119
believe that there's collectors out

2829
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:19,198
there and the plant hides

2830
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:20,960
yeah in places where it's hoping that

2831
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:23,198
someone cares about it and isn't just

2832
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,198
monetarily attached to it

2833
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:27,678
yeah but loves it

2834
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:28,719
you know and a lot of the things that i

2835
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,719
have

2836
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,239
um i wouldn't have because i would have

2837
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:33,600
gotten rid of them as soon as they were

2838
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:34,479
unpopular

2839
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,719
yeah

2840
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:37,839
but i personally liked them and cared

2841
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,439
about them

2842
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,960
and then there's friends of mine that

2843
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:42,559
feel the same way and that's why they

2844
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,760
have their [ __ ]

2845
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:47,840
you know yeah and so it's it's a general

2846
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,840
theme among our friends yeah it's a

2847
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,840
theme you know and if you get it's like

2848
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:53,279
you get trusted in circles and

2849
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,760
you know maybe we can go into this

2850
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:57,439
there's an aspect of like authenticity

2851
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,719
that we were gonna talk about before

2852
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:00,158
right because we are kind of getting an

2853
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,239
hour and a half into it so maybe we can

2854
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:04,638
talk a little bit about this and there's

2855
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:06,319
there's aspects of things where

2856
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:08,159
now that i'm being public

2857
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:09,599
okay and i'm starting to tell some of

2858
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:10,479
these stories

2859
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,000
um

2860
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:14,000
i should say that there's a lot of

2861
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,600
things that maybe like five or ten

2862
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,719
percent of the wheat community knows

2863
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,119
pretty well

2864
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:21,439
yeah um that becomes difficult where how

2865
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:23,679
do you let the other 90 know

2866
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:25,599
yeah so there's a lot of like accepted

2867
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:28,000
facts among small groups of people that

2868
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,920
want to trade this kind of information

2869
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,880
right sure and then you want to get it

2870
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,880
out there

2871
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:35,039
and you get [ __ ] attacked

2872
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,800
yeah and so you know matt can attest

2873
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:38,800
that he tried to get me to do this for a

2874
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,679
long ass time and i wouldn't

2875
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,760
yeah

2876
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,039
right i mean well i mean you were just

2877
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,600
watching what happened to me and you're

2878
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:47,760
like [ __ ] that i don't want that in my

2879
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:51,199
life i was also like you know i mean i

2880
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,159
did i did caleb's event up in uh uh

2881
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:53,359
that's right

2882
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:56,158
you know and it was like i showed my

2883
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:58,158
face i was in front of a huge crowd yeah

2884
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:00,158
you know of people and i was just like

2885
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:02,158
oh my god you know i mean i didn't give

2886
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:03,439
my real name but it's still at the time

2887
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:04,719
it was difficult

2888
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:07,279
yeah but

2889
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:09,118
what it comes down to is that if

2890
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:11,920
what convinced me to do it

2891
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:13,359
is is like if you don't try to get some

2892
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,118
version of the truth out there or what

2893
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:16,639
you believe to be the truth

2894
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:17,679
and it's just going to be overwhelmed by

2895
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:20,319
[ __ ]

2896
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:22,000
yeah right and there's an aspect where

2897
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,198
it's like and i really get upset about

2898
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,679
it sometimes

2899
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:27,439
where there's this ig thing where people

2900
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:30,639
pile on each other

2901
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:31,839
yeah okay and you know matt's a villain

2902
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:34,319
on ig

2903
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,840
yes i want to be to a lot of but to a

2904
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:36,880
lot of people that don't know him in

2905
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,119
real life

2906
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:43,359
yeah you know and if we want to fast

2907
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:44,799
forward a bit before kovid um matt and i

2908
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:46,799
there was other friends that helped and

2909
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,960
stuff like that so i'm not trying to

2910
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,880
just to diss anyone i'm not mentioning

2911
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,600
but matt and i and a few other friends

2912
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:55,279
kind of like uh got this idea to throw

2913
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,679
what we called like the can illuminati

2914
01:36:55,279 --> 01:37:00,319
party yeah and it was sort of kind of

2915
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:02,560
based on ron's old parties and some of

2916
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:04,399
those old gatherings but more modern

2917
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,560
yeah and we decided to do it the same

2918
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:08,319
weekend as

2919
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,520
emerald cup

2920
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:13,599
you know because um

2921
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,480
everybody would be in town

2922
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:19,119
yeah so we rented a huge house

2923
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:21,839
and invited a bunch of people over

2924
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:23,279
on friday and saturday night of emerald

2925
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,039
cup

2926
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:27,279
and both years you know we had hundreds

2927
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:30,158
of people come through the house

2928
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:31,599
yeah right and believe it or not nobody

2929
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:33,839

2930
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,440
no what do you know nobody attacked matt

2931
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,840

2933
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,319

2934
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:42,799

lot of friends you get a bunch of

2938
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,679
collectors and breeders and weed nerds

2939
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:51,039
and people in the industry that come

2940
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,840
through and want to hang out with each

2941

other

2942
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,880
and you got to realize that like we were

2943
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:56,238
trying to throw an event where it's like

3002

believe

3003
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:44,319

01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:50,000
bunch of friends it was smoking out

3008
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,359
time you know trading beans trading cuts

3009
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:57,279
making connections putting faces to

3010
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:59,198
names right yeah

3011
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:01,039
all that different types of stuff

3012
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:03,198
right and so

3013
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:04,719
you have an aspect where

3014
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:06,000
we've had some issues this week where

3015
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:08,239
you know you start having these talks

3016
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,639
week by week and like i said matt's a

3017
01:40:08,238 --> 01:40:12,399
bit of a villain online and because now

3018
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:14,239
i'm coming out and we haven't even hit

3019
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:15,679
some of the controversial topics yet but

3020
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:16,718
as i'm coming out and talking about

3021
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:20,079
stuff

3022
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:21,359
um you start getting enemies

3023
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:23,679
you start getting people that are

3024
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:26,479
annoyed that people are listening to you

3025
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:29,600
or not believe your version of events

3026
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:31,279
or you know on ig or on various discords

3027
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,280
they want to like disparage your

3028
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,079
character and say you weren't around and

3029
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:35,599
say

3030
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:38,079
that you didn't have anything or your

3031
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,039
weed was [ __ ] or your seeds suck or

3032
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:41,760
whatever

3033
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:43,760
and honestly like it becomes really hard

3034
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:45,119
because a lot of people that are

3035
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,800
listening

3036
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:48,238
you don't know the person you're siding

3037
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,119
with and you don't know the person that

3038
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:53,198
you're against in real life yeah

3039
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:56,399
like in an honest real life

3040
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:57,599
yeah no you know so it becomes hard how

3041
01:40:56,399 --> 01:40:59,679
do you choose

3042
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,039
you know how do you make stuff happen i

3043
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:03,039
mean there was people that were accusing

3044
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,399
me this week of not even see the chems

3045
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:05,519
until oh eight

3046
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:07,439
yeah

3047
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,440
you know and then i came out of nowhere

3048
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:12,399
and that all my stories are lies and not

3049
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:15,118
so it just means the stories are not so

3050
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:16,879
and let's let's be fair though like

3051
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:19,439
the the people that were doing this were

3052
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,279
people that were in the outer circle of

3053
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,439
our friend group and never made it quite

3054
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:24,639
on the in circle because they were

3055
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:26,479
they were bad people and they [ __ ]

3056
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:28,480
people over or they did certain things

3057
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:30,238
people haven't seen pretty bad

3058
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:32,559
yeah you know and that's my point right

3059
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:34,479
so matt will come out and say this

3060
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,159
person's a scammer he's stealing cuts

3061
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:37,678
he's trying to [ __ ] you over he's trying

3062
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:39,839
to take your money

3063
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:42,158
yeah and then that person and like and

3064
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,440
and some bots and like a bunch of fake

3065
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:45,439
accounts and a bunch of people that

3066
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:47,678
bought seeds all attacked matt

3067
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:50,238
yeah you know he's a [ __ ] he's a jew

3068
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:53,039
he's fat he's this he i got oh

3069
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:54,238
nazi he's a knockout jewish nazi all

3070
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:56,560
these various things they're getting

3071
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,919
attacked and so as i become a public

3072
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,840
figure a little bit like they start

3073
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,840
attacking oh is that that party as weed

3074
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:03,520
sucks this and that everything else and

3075
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,719
let's find people to throw barbs that's

3076
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,560
part of it

3077
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:08,880
yeah right and i'm not even saying you

3078
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,679
should trust me but what i am saying is

3079
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,639
that

3080
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:15,039
you know weed as a a lot of people lived

3081
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:16,560
in the shadows yeah and it's not

3082
01:42:15,039 --> 01:42:18,399
documented and the reason why we're

3083
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,039
doing a bunch of these stories

3084
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:22,399
is because we want to get oral history

3085
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:24,079
out there and we want to do it in a

3086
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:25,279
conversational fashion that doesn't bore

3087
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:26,319
you to death

3088
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:28,238
yeah

3089
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:29,920
and we try to do that and then that

3090
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:31,519
steps on toes and then people are

3091
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,440
furious

3092
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,800
and so they they they can't [ __ ] with

3093
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:35,678
the story

3094
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,440
right

3095
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:38,800
um but so they'll [ __ ] with matt or

3096
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:41,118
they'll [ __ ] with me or let's say you're

3097
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:44,480
a liar they say oh i know for a fact he

3098
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:46,479
didn't touch chem until after oh eight

3099
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:48,319
or he didn't have this or his this his

3100
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:49,839
headband is watered down or whatever

3101
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:52,880
they want to say about matt it's just

3102
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:54,000
the 707 yeah just just some [ __ ] and

3103
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,440

3104
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,439

some stuff that matt's doing or you know

3129
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:47,759
csi or different people at times because

3130
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,039
there is a financial element to like

3131
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,560
making all these different types of

3132
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:54,719
stuff work right to some degree um but

3133
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,960

01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:09,519
have to decide because there are some

3140

3206
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,638
like a general sense

3207
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:16,480
um because you start calling out

3208
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:18,079
individual people and then the next week

3209
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:20,718
of my life is [ __ ]

3210
01:46:18,079 --> 01:46:21,600
that [ __ ] trying to defend themselves

3211
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:24,960
yes

3212
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:27,199

3215
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:34,158
yeah not all of it is not all of it is

3216
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:36,639
is beneficial to the people

3217
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:38,158
no unfortunately but then you can't you

3218
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:40,400
know it doesn't pay to spend your whole

3219
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:42,000
life trying to warn the fam unity

3220
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:43,279
about no jack off because it's

3221
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,520
whack-a-mole

3222
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:48,158
yeah i tried that i really did and and

3223
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,320
it just it did not pay off it was it was

3224
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:52,479
detrimental to my career

3225
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:53,599
i will say i don't recommend people do

3226
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:56,238
that for

3227
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:58,639
any reason whatsoever if you have a an

3228
01:46:56,238 --> 01:47:00,959
interest in being successful

3229
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:02,400
yeah i mean i uh

3230
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,000
so yeah you know i mean there's there's

3231
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:05,519
that aspect and so i'm not saying trust

3232
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,439
me or trust matt

3233
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,199
i'm saying like if you're giving us your

3234
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:11,039
time every friday night you get to talk

3235
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:12,638
to us at length and ask questions and

3236
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:15,519
stuff eventually

3237
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:16,960
you have to maybe you can hear enough of

3238
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,159
things that you get a general sense of

3239
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:21,359
who we are

3240
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:24,479
yeah but i will say that ig is an image

3241
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:26,719
and the sociopaths are very very good

3242
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:29,519
at curating an image

3243
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:31,279
yeah you know they do best

3244
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:32,560
and um you know and yeah someone just

3245
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:34,158
said nobody's perfect people aren't

3246
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,280
perfect you're right

3247
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:37,439
people aren't

3248
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:38,880
you know um people aren't perfect and

3249
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:40,559
i'm not even trying to judge people

3250
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,079
that's why i'm not calling anybody out

3251
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:43,760
by name

3252
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:46,000
yeah i'm just saying a general i'm just

3253
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,360
saying a general state of events

3254
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,039

3257
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,239
one more big thing i want to i want to

3258
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,639

3259
01:47:56,238 --> 01:48:01,279

whatever you were about to do or you're

3267
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:17,039
not no no i i still need some of the um

3268
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:18,239
the ultimate details yeah yeah so

3269
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:21,359
because i don't want it just to be my

3270
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:23,519
opinion i want it to be dude's own words

3271
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:24,719
sure no i get it yeah so i mean and

3272
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,440
that's kind of what we talk about like

3273
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:29,520
when people are like the can illuminati

3274
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:31,039
you know yeah the can illuminati is not

3275
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:34,080
like some kind of organization or

3276
01:48:31,039 --> 01:48:35,679
membership there's no dues you know

3277
01:48:34,079 --> 01:48:37,279
there's no one that controls it what it

3278
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:39,440
basically means

3279
01:48:37,279 --> 01:48:41,439
is that you're enough of a weed head

3280
01:48:39,439 --> 01:48:43,759
that you care enough of the history to

3281
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:46,879
hold on to strains to hold on to seeds

3282
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:49,119
to want to dig for the truth and you

3283
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:51,118
talk to other people like that and it

3284
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:52,079
basically it's a it's a like-minded

3285
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:54,238
group

3286
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:56,399
of people and we know who each other are

3287
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:58,879
and it's like even amongst that group

3288
01:48:56,399 --> 01:49:00,879
there's not even really trading

3289
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:03,199
no there's just like dude like once you

3290
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,639
know it's like uh you know a skunk va

3291
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:05,839
and i were talking earlier today about

3292
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:06,719
it it's like we're not going to trade

3293
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,800
anything

3294
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:10,800
no like it's like oh you need a couple

3295
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,480
of these and and i can get you this or

3296
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,960
whatever it's it's not like a trade it's

3297
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:16,638
more just like you know

3298
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,239
yes this is what i have this is what you

3299
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:19,440
have yeah you know i'm not saying

3300
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:21,279
there's anything wrong with trading

3301
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:22,559
because trading is perfectly acceptable

3302
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:24,079
especially if you don't know each other

3303
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,920
but once you've been personal friends

3304
01:49:24,079 --> 01:49:28,319
for a couple of decades

3305
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:30,399
yeah it's just friends helping friends

3306
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,880
yeah you know and a lot of the ways that

3307
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:34,719
this stuff exists like you know our

3308
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:36,000
history that's really why i'm chatting

3309
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:37,760
is because i don't want all of our

3310
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,880
history to be lost

3311
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,400
no

3312
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:43,118
i want it to be out there in some kind

3313
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:45,198
of form and it's almost all oral

3314
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:47,359
yeah and and with a lot of the forums

3315
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:49,519
going down over the years whether it be

3316
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:51,679
from the feds you know getting a hold of

3317
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:54,400
the ic mag server to

3318
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:56,880
uh you know can a collective pot pimp

3319
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:58,799
any of the the uh seed depot any of

3320
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:01,920
those that have gone down they had a lot

3321
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:03,920
of uh information on them like c depot a

3322
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:06,399
lot of people that people look at today

3323
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,158
as old school heroes and whatnot or

3324
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:10,479
really trustworthy people all popped up

3325
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:12,479
on seed depot and their whole history is

3326
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:13,839
gone because that's that site was gone

3327
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:16,799
the dude disappeared after [ __ ]

3328
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:18,079
everyone over they owned it so um that's

3329
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,760
gone but it's in a lot of people's

3330
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:21,679
memories so this is really the only

3331
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,360
chance we have to put that out there

3332
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:25,279
yeah and so we're just we're just trying

3333
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:26,238
to we're just trying to like regurgitate

3334
01:50:25,279 --> 01:50:27,679
stuff

3335
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:29,439
and get it out there and get different

3336
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:30,480
versions of things

3337
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:31,919
yeah you know

3338
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:34,079
um and

3339
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,000
and you know like like anything you know

3340
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:37,679
some of these stories there's people

3341
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,439
that have different memories

3342
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,960
yeah there's people that have different

3343
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:43,039
versions even like the three or four

3344
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,800
people that were there might not tell

3345
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:46,880
the same tale

3346
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,320
yeah they were the ones that were there

3347
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,000
i know i got a nickname for being a

3348
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:54,559
power bottom at the last party and i'm

3349
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:56,238
pretty sure i was power top pretty sure

3350
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,679
you know but i mean it's cool because

3351
01:50:56,238 --> 01:50:59,919
then you get then you get you know these

3352
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:02,000
parties these gatherings and stuff they

3353
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,760
really are bonding

3354
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,279
yeah they really are where human

3355
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,800
connections are made

3356
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:08,000
you get to smoke a bunch of your good

3357
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,679
friends weed

3358
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,520
you get to see them in person you get to

3359
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:13,039
hear what their voice sounds like and

3360
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:14,960
and hear them laugh

3361
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:16,000
you get to break bread and food with

3362
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,480
people

3363
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,639
you know yeah um and you get to share

3364
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:22,638
weed and share experiences and so i

3365
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,639
think that's you know what maybe we can

3366
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:26,239
get the cantaloupe can illuminati

3367
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:28,480
parties together again

3368
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:29,519
uh now that covid seems to be dying down

3369
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:31,439
and there's lots of people that are

3370
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,159
either been infected or vaccinated and

3371
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:35,678
it's not so much like the plague yeah it

3372
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:37,279
was for a few years where it was

3373
01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:39,359
shutting [ __ ] down

3374
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:41,118
um but those kind of gatherings are

3375
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:42,719
important and so tonight you know we're

3376
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:44,559
almost at two hours so i'll probably

3377
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:46,319
shut up here in a second but

3378
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,400
i just wanted to give like a general

3379
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:50,399
random overview of some of the

3380
01:51:48,399 --> 01:51:51,679
overlapping things that were happening

3381
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:53,439
in that era

3382
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:55,359
yeah that really set the stage for

3383
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:56,879
everything that came after

3384
01:51:55,359 --> 01:51:58,319
yeah it was really where a lot of

3385
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,079
friendships were made it was where a lot

3386
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:02,399
of trading and a lot of seed exchange

3387
01:52:00,079 --> 01:52:03,679
was done it was where a lot of cuttings

3388
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,638
and a lot of people smoking other

3389
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:09,118
people's weed and learning happened and

3390
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,560
then a lot of those guys um ended up

3391
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:11,759
becoming super well known in the

3392
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,719
community

3393
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,840
yeah

3394
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:17,520
you know

3395
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:18,639
um so you know it it it uh

3396
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,080
you know but you don't know it at the

3397
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,760
time

3398
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:23,279
no that's the that's the funny thing

3399
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,480
about history is you don't know if

3400
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:26,319
you're if you're making it you don't

3401
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:28,079
know you know so

3402
01:52:26,319 --> 01:52:29,599
um but really what it boils down to is

3403
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:30,719
we're all just people

3404
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:32,319
some of us

3405
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:34,158
care about the plant

3406
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:36,639
yeah uh some of us care about rap and

3407
01:52:34,158 --> 01:52:37,679
money and and and you know scamming

3408
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:39,599
people

3409
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,800
and there's a big conflict between those

3410
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,560
two right now

3411
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:45,119
yeah in the community there's been one

3412
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:47,039
for a long time yeah but it's gotten

3413
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:49,359
more public and i mean even like you

3414
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:51,198
know matt's been doxxed before

3415
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:52,559

3428
01:53:12,158 --> 01:53:16,158
know but but what's funny about that is

3429
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:17,759
that i can use that later to prove

3430
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:18,960
something that would like blow them up

3431
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,239
in the face

3432
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:22,399
yes

3433
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:25,198
yeah and i've been pushed enough enough

3434
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:26,960
times by this human being to

3435
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:28,479
you know just suck it sucks to have to

3436
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,719
do it but because

3437
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:32,319
they're saying such extreme [ __ ] like

3438
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:33,760
there's only a few things in life that i

3439
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:36,559
take real personal is when you talk

3440
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:38,719
about my friends family or you call me a

3441
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,480
[ __ ] nazi like

3442
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:42,719
i spent my whole young life

3443
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:44,799
just literally fist fighting nazis and

3444
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:46,960
being punched by them many many many

3445
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:49,039
times so i take it very seriously when

3446
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,880
someone accuses me of such things so

3447
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:52,840
