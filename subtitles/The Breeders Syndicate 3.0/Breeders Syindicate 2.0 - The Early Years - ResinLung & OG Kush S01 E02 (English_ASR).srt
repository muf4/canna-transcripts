72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
compared to what you guys were making

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,239
yeah yeah it was expensive the way we

74
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,079
grew eat you know that's right it wasn't

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,400
really cheap you know and [ __ ] we used

76

to pay 500 a [ __ ] day to get it

77

80
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,479
although

81
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,759

195
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,079
around during the time when you were

196
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
growing it like what were some of the

197
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,120
other variations that were out there of

198
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
the og

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
none

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,839
none that because it was so early on in

201

245
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,240
telling you it was such a [ __ ]

246
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
it was so many levels above

247
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,439
but you you didn't get involved with

248
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,838
[ __ ] like sauer and cam or any of that

249
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000

250
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,760
in the valley out here

00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,759
yeah uh

347
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
because we had to tear the house down so

348
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,838
i could build it up again and it was a

349
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,679
[ __ ]

350
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
it was a constant

351
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,359
we were constantly building and tearing

352
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,440
down dude

353
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,278
it was never ending dude

354
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,279
and following [ __ ] just a straight

355
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,679
recipe each time doing it that would get

356
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,958
tedious dude yeah again you know and

357
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,479
every now and then someone would very

358
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,078
often the [ __ ] [ __ ] would just go to

359
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,039
[ __ ] i mean because

360
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,399
it was

361
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,879
you couldn't you couldn't deviate from

362
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,039
the recipe you know yeah yeah

363
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,278

365
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,159
yeah no it was real easy to tell who the

366
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,600
[ __ ] was pinching off the top you don't
