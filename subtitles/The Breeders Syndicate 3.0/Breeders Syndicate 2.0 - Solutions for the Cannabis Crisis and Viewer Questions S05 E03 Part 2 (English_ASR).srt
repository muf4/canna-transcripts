32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
okay so let's resume part two part two

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,879
so

34
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,239
you know i i do think i do think that

35
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,359
the um

36
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,359
i do think that all the public

37
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,799
commentary this week calling out certain

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,478
people is one of the better ways um i

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,880
mean someone asked well how do you

40
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,319
educate the public right

41
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,640
so some of it is like just like the

42
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,639
stuff that we're doing right now

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,719
right where we do we do a show that's

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
not like that it's not all about us or

45
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,920
whatever and we try to talk about

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,519
different different aspects of the weed

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,600
industry and different content and some

48
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,078
history and different things because

49
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,559
educating people is the best way to get

50
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,639
people on your side right and i talk

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
about matt with matt all the time about

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
this where it's like

53
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,078
um you know we really have to like build

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,840
a coalition

55
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,718
yeah it's it's going it's going to be

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
political in a way or a civil right

57
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,798
yeah or a syndicate as the case may be

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,359
but we have to we have to build a

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
syndicate of like-minded people

60
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,439
and they can be pretty diverse and and

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,199
the important part is that we don't want

62
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,759
to eliminate a ton of people we want to

63
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,079
like have a general set of goals

64
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,159
yeah be all inclusive and you know

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
whether whether you're politics or this

66
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,598
year that like you know you got to be

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,319
relatively accepting of people that

68
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,799
share those same basic goals yeah right

69
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,318
and so for me those basic goals are like

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,480
not only do i want me to be legal i

71
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,878
wanted to be easily accessible

72
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,159
i wanted to be high quality and i want

73
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,840
people to be able to do what they want

74
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,239
with it yeah

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,598
you know and so i feel like and you know

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,599
i know that you rolled your eyes for a

77
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,919
second when i said oh we're winning

78
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,159
but in a sense you know because it does

79
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,479
feel like for cannabis industry people

80
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,560
it does feel like a pretty dark time

81
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,518
right there's a lot of change happening

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
fast

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,039
the pricing uh which used to like

84
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,759
fuel the insurgency if you will

85
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,519
yeah right like uh you know i mean

86
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,639
there's an aspect where it's like it was

87
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,640
so hard for anybody to beat the taliban

88
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,839
right because they had a bunch of heroin

89
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,079
and hash

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,319
yeah and so they were able to fund their

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
[ __ ] right and so when prices were

92
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,759
higher

93
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,439
uh the insurgency in america as far as

94
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,039
like you know wheat rights or whatever

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,199
was was better funded yeah um as the

96
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,079
price falls apart and various things a

97
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,039
lot of people start to struggle

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
you know

99
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,519
um but then you know the side benefit is

100
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,560
a lot more people get into it

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
yeah

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,439
right so like the coalition can get way

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
way way bigger than it ever was before

104
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,959
yeah

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,000
right so that's an advantage scary for

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,120
all of us like who depend on it solely

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,719
right yeah because change is scary but

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,799
so what it boils down to is the reason

109
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,400
why i said we're winning is because for

110
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,360
half my life they told me we couldn't

111
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,560
have it

112
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,400
and now they want to steal it from us

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,239
but they weren't successful in

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
preventing anything we wanted to do

115
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,200
before

116
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,039
yeah even though we had to battle them

117
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,518
for a long time to eventually get to

118
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,560
where we wanted to go yeah so i don't

119
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,319
view it

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,719
per i don't view it all that much

121
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,599
different than that yeah it's just like

122
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,639
the goals and the and and the idea has

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
changed

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,560
yeah it sure has right we're going from

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,520
like access

126
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,918
and and freedom and not being jailed and

127
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,478
all that to like now we get to choose

128
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,478
like well how do we want weed to look

129
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,159
how do we want it to be like

130
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,918
right and

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,680
oh you know so

132
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,439
there's there's an aspect of it where

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,439
it's like

134
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,199
i feel like people have had access to

135
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,360
most except there's a couple people on

136
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,280
here who disagree but there's uh most

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
people have access to pretty good weed

138
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,719
yeah right

139
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
shout out to dickie yeah there's some uh

140
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,320
there's some uh there's you know there's

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,478
some people sadly that have been exposed

142
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,319
to a bunch of jank if you will and are

143
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,639
unhappy with their access to weed but

144
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,680
lots of people's access to weed has

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,079
gotten much better yeah clone trading is

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
easier even if you don't have

147
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,599
i mean i don't like clone sellers all

148
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,160
that much to some degree but to be

149
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,919
honest like if you it might be a lot of

150
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
people's only way to get at certain

151
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,959
things

152
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,479
yeah right so it's available and it's

153
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,319
out there and it's like it's not it's

154
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,279
not it's like you can build a collection

155
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,599
now with some money yeah if you if you

156
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,719
have finances you can at least be given

157
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,560
the illusion that you're getting

158
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
something with prosecution and that's

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,079
and in some ways that's more that could

160
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
be that could be as satisfying as

161
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,680
waiting around to get into the right

162
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,120
groups for years and years before you

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,959
start getting some access to some of

164
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,720
this stuff yeah so even though it's

165
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,038
negative in some ways there's positive

166
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,000
in other ways because my whole goal with

167
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,399
weed is uh more people smoking better

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,240
weed yeah

169
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,918
right and you know people are talking

170
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,960
about i can barely find weed without the

171
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,038
[ __ ] cookies bottleneck right

172
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,758
and that's hard and that's fair exactly

173
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,079
that's that's fair because really i mean

174
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,520
we we're gonna jump around i guess a

175
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,879
little bit if we start talking about

176
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,318
that but

177
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,319
basically that's the fight okay and so

178
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,800
instagram we like to get into a lot of

179
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,199
petty fights with one another

180
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,038
okay uh there might even be someone that

181
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,319
like you know has participated in a

182
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,240
petty fight every now and again

183
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,080
some of them are good some of them are

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,400
good-natured and good-hearted some of

185
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,918
them are a little bit more you know we

186
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,318
but we gotta pick our battles because

187
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,918
it's like yeah you know uh you might be

188
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,120
battling with someone but like both of

189
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,839
you were like well i'm not i don't

190
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,959
believe in working with cops yeah

191
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,079
so we have this consensus right

192
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,839
right where

193
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,000
you know we want a consensus of better

194
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,038
weed and i'll tell a story for a second

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,038
because

196
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,560
there's an aspect of this that i think

197
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,079
is the truth is

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,639
you know when

199
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,560
um when we made alcohol illegal uh with

200
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,720
the with the whatever amendment it was

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,160
right yeah um

202
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
for a bunch of time

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
only the only the mob and everybody else

204
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,560
ran alcohol

205
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,478
yeah and then there was so much drinking

206
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
and so much lawlessness around it that

207
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,318
they basically repealed it because it

208
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,960
was better to have it legal than illegal

209
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,879
yeah they over grew over drank if you

210
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,638
were they didn't i think they were

211
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,038
seeing a lot of tax dollars go out the

212
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,120
side and yeah and so yeah and so but

213
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,918
then there's an aspect right where

214
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,639
um for the next like 50 or 60 years

215
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,959
after they legalized it yeah they forced

216
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,639
a bunch of [ __ ] beer on america

217
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,399
oh near beers

218
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,478
just you know it was like when i when i

219
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,719
was in in just even in the 90s when i

220
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,399
was going to in bars in chicago like the

221
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,800
nicest beer was heineken

222
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,359
i wonder if during prohibition alcohol

223
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,918
got cheaper when it was legalized or if

224
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
it got more expensive but the quality i

225
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,758
guess your i guess there was a bunch of

226
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,359
[ __ ] cheap there was one so i i guess

227
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
what i'm basically saying is that it

228
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
broke

229
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,759
the quality it it broke the relationship

230
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,840
to quality for a while right

231
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,639
decades even and everybody could choose

232
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,439
between coors or michelob or budweiser

233
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,560
or

234
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,719
old style or freaking you know keystone

235
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,879
or you know it was all cheap shitty

236
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,960
pilsners yeah right and then there was

237
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,639
this like revolution that happened which

238
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,959
was basically like people deciding well

239
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,720
what if we just brewed good beer

240
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:25,038
yeah right microbreweries yeah and now

241
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
um you know the budweiser budweiser

242
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,759
makes half the barrels and makes a

243
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,520
budweiser now that it did in the 90s

244
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,879
yeah half

245
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,559
and it was one of the biggest beer

246
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,200
companies in the nation

247
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,478
you know they ended up buying 15 or 18

248
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,919
micro brews

249
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,680
yeah because they want they didn't want

250
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,000
to lose their micro their their share

251
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,359
but what i mean by that is that what's

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,879
going to come

253
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,639
is people are going to try to start

254
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,919
selling really cheap really shitty weed

255
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,000
for expensive

256
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,399
yeah and hoping that's your only option

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
and you just deal with it yeah

258
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,120
and a lot of people don't know that

259
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,560
there are better options

260
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,879
and you're going to these like you know

261
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,399
legal states or whatever

262
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,559
that are that you know that maybe some

263
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,080
of them don't have the greatest history

264
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,079
um that some of the more fortunate

265
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
states do in terms of like large amounts

266
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,440
of growers and access to really good

267
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,159
weed they might have had you know

268
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,680
mexican or beesters or you know sort of

269
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,600
the low grade of what comes from the

270
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,159
better states you know shipped to their

271
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,480
state and now it's legal and so you have

272
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,480
to push for you have to push for better

273
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,920
weed yeah

274
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,879
you know because they're going to try to

275
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,838
sell you okay weed for high prices

276
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,759
yeah

277
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,360
and you have to vote with your dollars

278
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,679
on better wheat

279
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,759
you know and then if your doll if you

280
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,439
can't find better weed then grow your

281
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,919
own and keep your dollars in your pocket

282
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,200
and spend it on something else yeah

283
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,199
you know and then eventually if enough

284
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,360
people don't buy shitty weed they'll

285
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,839
have a really hard time with shitty weed

286
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,759
i just think that's such a utopian

287
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,360
way of i mean it's true this is true

288
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,200
what you're saying it is logic and it's

289
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,680
true i just think it's such a utopian

290
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,759
view to hope that that will happen

291
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,120
why so here's the thing walmart is the

292
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,879
biggest supplier and yeah okay but let's

293
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,720
let's put it this way right and and

294
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,639
here's the gig there's nothing wrong

295
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,240
with that either because

296
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,838
there's plenty of people out there that

297
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,159
probably can't afford the quality of

298
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,000
weed that we like to smoke sure right

299
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,240
and so they might have to get lesser

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,919
quality wheat yeah so there's stuff like

301
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,680
that there is always going to be you

302
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,519
know an existence of the

303
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,199
the low quality there or there could be

304
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,480
some people that are like i'm fine with

305
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
this weed and i'm going to put it in a

306
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,680
metal pipe with a screen that i never

307
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,919
clean and it gets me high and i don't

308
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,759
care or mix it with tobacco and [ __ ]

309
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,199
yeah or mix it with tobacco or whatever

310
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,879
that and that's okay too i'm not trying

311
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
to be some snob but what i'm saying is

312
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,958
is that

313
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,719
like when i was when i was a kid okay

314
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,518
the only way you could get organic food

315
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,278
was like on dead tour or like crunchy or

316
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,480
organic co-ops

317
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:51,519
yeah

318
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,079
right

319
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,278
you know what i'm saying and

320
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,359
and now

321
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,799
um there's whole foods and there's all

322
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,720
these high-end stores and there's

323
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,359
organic food in almost every normal

324
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,360
grocery store yeah right because people

325
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,519
demanded a better grade

326
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,879
and they were willing to pay more for it

327
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,720
and now all of a sudden it's everywhere

328
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,559
when i was in the 90s you could not find

329
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,360
organic food in a normal grocery store

330
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,119
oh no yeah yeah there's christmas stores

331
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
yeah you [ __ ] couldn't you had to go

332
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,120
find some hippie crunchy store maybe it

333
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,958
existed and maybe it didn't

334
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,639
you know and so

335
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,239
you know if you say oh we can't do that

336
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,679
walmart's the biggest we can't because

337
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,320
we did it with food

338
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,759
yeah and you know it wasn't just hippies

339
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,600
here's the thing this is what people got

340
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,519
to realize right is that

341
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,040
hippies did not

342
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,879
make organic food a household name

343
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,278
yeah yuppies did

344
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,600
yes hippies provided the basis but

345
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,720
there's these [ __ ] yuppies right and

346
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
they look around and they're like i

347
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,759

everybody else shops i want nicer food

354
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,120
yeah

355
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,240
you don't think they're not gonna want

356
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,240
[ __ ] 120 day haze at some point some

357
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
of the first places i saw organic stuff

358
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,120
popping up in california was places like

359
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,159
santa barbara um you know like like

360
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
really

361
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,319
well-to-do areas in like beach

362
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,759
communities i started seeing lots of

363
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
organics

364
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,679
and now it's now it's spread everywhere

365
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,759
so there's i mean so there's there's

366
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,799
enough people that are going to want

367
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:34,319
high grade good smoking weed

368
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:37,120
to have a huge market of high grade weed

369
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,800
it doesn't have to be the whole market

370
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,519
you know it has to be enough of the

371
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,719
market to supply that

372
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,639
we just want to

373
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,879
craft

374
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,799
right but yeah but but the thing is is

375
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,519
that like all those yuppies that i just

376
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,799
mentioned that did that to organic food

377
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,480
when they what do you what kind of weed

378
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,639
do you think they want to buy the thing

379
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,560
is food is different than weed

380
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,600
food

381
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,599
food one is it's necessary

382
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,200
everybody eats food not everybody smokes

383
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,000
weed everybody's eating food they're

384
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,320
really like experience with quality not

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
everybody has smoked weed their whole

386
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,079
life and has experience with quality to

387
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,320
know quality when they're getting it i

388
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,638
mean you could see i could see yuppies

389
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,160
buying 80 cookies eights in these

390
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,399
baggies and thinking they're getting the

391
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,078
supreme quality and they can be

392
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,839
they can be confused into it and i think

393
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,958
we're going to see a lot of that because

394
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,959
they would have to search out the

395
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,559
education you can't force education on

396
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,638
these people

397
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,638
it's going to take time it will take

398
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,519
time in in the organic food case we're

399
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,639
talking over a 20 or 30 year period bro

400
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,320
yeah

401
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,360
right and then what's going to be left

402
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,320
in 20 or 30 years with weed and strains

403
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
and

404
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,839
all these things that we're going to

405
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
lose over that 20 to 30 year period

406
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,839
because none of the people that run

407
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
these grows that are going to be able to

408
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,279
survive and compete

409
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,720
monetarily are going to be the ones

410
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,439
keeping these old strains with these

411
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,199
special qualities so you're correct and

412
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,120
i'm not trying to be

413
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,799
you know remember that we're trying to

414
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,078
make the theme is like what can people

415
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,039
do damn it rather than like give up hope

416
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,159
and like drink

417
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,679
jewelry

418
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,240
we're not trying to we're not trying to

419
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,319
drink bleach tonight so okay yes so the

420
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,560
aspect is is that there's going to be a

421
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
ton of people out there that smoke weed

422
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,000
that

423
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,039
don't rely on weed entirely for their

424
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,198
income yeah there are lots of people out

425
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,480
there okay that can

426
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:33,759
save a few strains in their collection

427
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,079
as a hobbyist sure right there are there

428
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,078
are people that can buy one or two packs

429
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:41,599
from their favorite readers

430
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:43,278
and that and that adds up like you know

431
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,839
when when i'm talking about food in the

432
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,439
90s think about like all these heirloom

433
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,560
vegetables that just popped out of

434
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,959
nowhere

435
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,039
they were maintained by like a dedicated

436
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,838
group of traders and like and

437
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,919
enthusiasts without very much without

438
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,240
very much money in it for a long time

439
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,838
that's very true now the risk is is that

440
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,759
they if their [ __ ] wasn't highly

441
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,600
regulated and taxed and illegal like i

442
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,039
said they could grow [ __ ] 45

443
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,879
different kinds of tomatoes in their

444
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,480
backyard and trade it with all their

445
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,559
friends and mail it all over the place

446
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,399
and trade seeds and no one gave a [ __ ]

447
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,919
yeah they haven't let us do that yet

448
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,919
with weed so they're making our job

449
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,439
[ __ ] harder yes

450
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,879
that's right they're making it harder

451
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,360
i'm not saying it's easy it's [ __ ]

452
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,480
hard like i have a big i have a big mom

453
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,800
collection

454
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,000
right it's [ __ ] expensive it sucks

455
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,719
it's tough

456
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,559
it's it's hard it's it's fearful and you

457
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,320
know we're still paying electric bills

458
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,559
from years ago

459
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,000
oh my [ __ ] god dude so

460
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,919
i don't even want to talk about that

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
yeah but but there's an aspect where

462
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,759
there's you know there's 215 people

463
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,000
listening to us right now or whatever if

464
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,919
each person decided there's one or two

465
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,879
strains i love and i'm going to try to

466
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,799
make sure this one stays alive

467
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,958
and then thousands of people start to do

468
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,198
that then not everyone has to hold on to

469
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,799
everything that's very true but if a

470
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,159
couple people just if enough people

471
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,240
decide to hold on to the electric

472
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,719
boogaloo and a couple people decide to

473
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,159
[ __ ] hold on to you know chem 91 and

474
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,040
these people decide to hold on to some

475
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,759
haze and you know i mean honestly the

476
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,559
way that i don't lose [ __ ] because i do

477
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,919
lose [ __ ] is i try to find people

478
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,919
that love certain things

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,159
and these four or five these four or

480
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,599
five things yeah they grow and they love

481
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,919
i'm not asking them to hold on to

482
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,278
anything that they don't love yeah but

483
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,639
they don't want to lose it either

484
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,000
they're in love with it right they want

485
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,639
to have you know it's one of the ways

486
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,120
that deep that all these things survived

487
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,000
you know and um

488
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,679
and

489
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
you know and and there's an aspect to it

490
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,439
too where i did this for a long time and

491
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,039
now all of a sudden a bunch of the stuff

492
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,800
that i have is like in demand or

493
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,958
whatever because

494
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,240
it's old and it's like it there's not

495
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,119
that many people that have held it that

496
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,799
long yeah but everyone on this thing has

497
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,959
the ability to do that to one or two

498
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,159
things there's a constant thing like

499
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,078
when we were throwing our little canned

500
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,159
illuminati parties before covet [ __ ]

501
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,480
everything up yep you know i would

502
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,918
mostly honestly guys i would mostly grow

503
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,279
one or two or three things for the

504
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,640
market

505
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,160
but then i'd have a section of the

506
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
greenhouse or whatever that was just

507
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,160
like my heads yeah it's dash and i

508
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,640
probably brought what did i bring like

509
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,199
probably 20 or 30 different things each

510
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,199
year yeah i'd say that's fair if not

511
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,480
more yeah right you know

512
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,839
i brought we brought a bunch we brought

513
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,838
a bunch of different things for it right

514
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,519
so then so then you know it's like

515
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,279
trading amongst you and your friends and

516
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,359
smoke some of this good weed try this

517
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,759
out try this weird thing out right yeah

518
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,879
there's a space for hobby

519
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:39,200
so if we want if we want like we can't

520
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,080
trust corporations we can't trust cookie

521
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,840
we can't trust jbz we can't trust

522
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,480
[ __ ] glass any of these people to

523
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,798
hold to be like a genetic library no

524
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,120
right that's fair to say it's got to be

525
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,160
diffused and independent

526
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,239
yes

527
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
because even if those people did save it

528
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,919
they would save it to profit off it

529
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,600
yes so it's not like they give you

530
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,440
[ __ ] access to it

531
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,798
so like oh how great i mean you know

532
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,798
there was a there was a question that

533
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,720
somebody asked about uh the impact of t

534
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,639
tissue culture on breeder markets and

535
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,519
collections

536
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,919
um

537
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,400
and uh maybe i'll maybe i'll jump into

538
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,679
that for just a second because uh

539
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
we're not going to name names here

540
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,720
either but matt's lost his uh matt lost

541
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,240
a chunk of stuff once trusting in that

542
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,400
and there's an aspect where people are

543
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,319
offering all these [ __ ] services

544
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,240
but they're like give me all of your

545
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,079
life's collection

546
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,160
and let me hold on to it for you with no

547
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,839
contracts and i'll be tissue culture

548
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,200
every single one of those [ __ ]

549
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,959
oh i'll i'll

550
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,720
i'll i'll bring it back i'll get it

551
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,400
healthy i'll hold it you just give me

552
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,880
all your valuable stuff i'll hold on to

553
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,679
it yes right and so and there's no and

554
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,160
so for a collector like you know that

555
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,160
works off the honor system i have high

556
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,600
suspicion

557
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
that they would just take the collection

558
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,959
and do whatever the [ __ ] they want with

559
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,919
it and use it in whatever way monetized

560
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,440
it the most for themselves yeah

561
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,960
and then just lie and say oh they got it

562
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,320
from someone else so why we didn't use

563
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,960
your version exactly so tc to me

564
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,678
tc's cool if you want to do it yourself

565
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,360
but if you want to involve some like big

566
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,798
backed corporation

567
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,159
you know our company that doesn't have

568
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,079
your best interest at heart with the way

569
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,600
the legal scene is around marijuana

570
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,199
right now which is not very enforceable

571
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,079
and everyone bends the rules every which

572
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,840
way they want yeah i wouldn't say like

573
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,480
you would trust your tc collection

574
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,759
unless it was like your oldest homie and

575
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,440
you had a lot of love and you really

576
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,400
trusted him

577
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,759
like if cs if csi opened up a nursery

578
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
and like had a

579
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,759
you know

580
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,120
yeah our radio you know

581
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,440
um there's various people that are

582
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,798
friends of ours that we trust yeah

583
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,200
you know but for the most part you're

584
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,519
turning your [ __ ] over to some stranger

585
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,160
yeah and if you don't know them for many

586
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,918
many years it's a stranger but even if

587
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,000
you do you're still i mean mostly yeah

588
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,720
it's always a risk this is a valuable

589
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,919
thing to a lot of people i mean i i joke

590
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,679
about it with matt and some of my

591
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,120
friends but like for in the last five or

592
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,640
six years every single person that

593
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,439
screwed me over has been a long-term

594
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,640
friend yeah as the scene has gotten

595
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,159
tougher

596
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,840
people are making different ethical

597
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,280
choices about how to stay alive and how

598
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:18,480
to keep their their lifestyle going yeah

599
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,158
right and so for me i don't trust tc

600
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,880
i don't trust i don't trust the

601
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,679
collection to to being entities right

602
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,760
now

603
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,840
they're not established enough i don't

604
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,279
like you know i just don't trust them

605
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,038
yep doesn't mean i might not in the

606
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,639
future like it might develop to the

607
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,759
point where i decide to take a risk or

608
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
something like that but there's an

609
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,319
aspect where right now it's just kind of

610
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,759
wild wild west and like in the cannabis

611
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,439
scene

612
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,000
so i just think they're offering to do

613
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,360
it because you have something of value

614
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,640
a case in point i'm not going to name

615
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,479
any names but with the tc situation this

616
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,600
wasn't my experience but i was involved

617
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
a little bit

618
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,798
there are examples of people taking

619
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,120
someone's dutted plant

620
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,798
and to to clean them up

621
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,479
meristem wise

622
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:03,918
putting it off for six months with

623
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
promises oh yeah it's going it's going

624
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,880
good because you know a lot of us don't

625
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,880
know how long this takes it was a new

626
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,080
thing when this was happening and then

627
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
returning

628
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,960
a

629
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,960
tiny tiny tiny little clone and telling

630
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,798
them that it's tissue culture and it

631
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,759
still does it we've seen and this isn't

632
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,079
even the same person we were talking

633
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,359
about earlier there are so many examples

634
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,158
of

635
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,199
new technologies coming to cannabis and

636
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,120
finding ways to take advantage of

637
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
of people who have these collections and

638
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,719
whatnot so that person that person might

639
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,558
have paid four thousand dollars to get

640
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,079
that thing meristem that person paid

641
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,359
five thousand dollars five thousand

642
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,240
dollars to get it

643
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:42,639
with no with no like refunder proof

644
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,079
if it it i mean if it tested positive

645
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,080
give me my five thousand back

646
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,038
and refund that [ __ ] but you know what

647
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,159
i'm saying

648
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,759
but that should be standard you

649
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,559
shouldn't be able to charge for some

650
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,879
process that fails yeah right that's

651
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,399
that's you know and and so

652
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,799
so there's an aspect where like not to

653
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
get lost in the tc thing but

654
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,918
but one of the aspects of these larger

655
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,038
companies coming in is very soon the

656
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,120
gelato and and and purple wave and all

657
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,440
this cookie and overbred [ __ ] it's gonna

658
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,678
still exist it's way too popular to like

659
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,240
go away forever but it's gonna become a

660
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,240
segment of the market not just a market

661
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,440
and so there's a huge interest

662
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,200
in getting back all these old things

663
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
yeah you know and there's you know for

664
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,080
all these clone sellers and stuff like

665
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,319
that i mean that's one of the risks of

666
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,000
selling clones is like like you can have

667
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,480
somebody somebody that works at one of

668
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,919
these places this gets gets given money

669
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,279
and it's like and all of a sudden you're

670
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,759
just buying it

671
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,079
yeah you know so it's like i don't mind

672
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,599
if [ __ ] gets out there i just mind if

673
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,879
those people if it gets out there and

674
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,959
then all of a sudden they try to claim

675
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,080
it as theirs and restrict others access

676
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,558
to it yeah because in my perfect world

677
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,839
like just to like throw a marker down i

678
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,639
think that all weed that was bred before

679
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,959
2018

680
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,559
should be open source

681
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,640
that's a fair statement

682
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,798
and you can't [ __ ] claim [ __ ] there's

683
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,200
nothing before 2018 that you can't

684
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,639
patent it it ain't [ __ ] yours i don't

685
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,279
give a [ __ ]

686
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,480
it's it's [ __ ] it's it's open source

687
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,480
to some degree it doesn't mean you have

688
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
access to it

689
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,200
right but you can't restrict it legally

690
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,440
you can't sue me for having it

691
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
dj shorts butthole is like this tight

692
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,000
right now

693
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,759
but it's effed up you know i mean it's

694
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,558
like it is and the only reason i said

695
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,640
his name is because he has a very public

696
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,079
claim to those using blueberry and stuff

697
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
and he does not like that oh he used to

698
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,199
put it on his packs that you're not

699
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,038
allowed to breed with it that you're not

700
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,038
allowed to this with it that they retain

701
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,038
control of the line or whatever the case

702
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,400
may be and i understand that too but

703
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:43,759
that's part of selling seeds is that

704
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
you're putting it out there in the world

705
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,519
and then anyone can do anything they

706
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,038
want with it and that's the trade-off

707
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,960
that and that's been happening since the

708
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,119
beginning of time yeah

709
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,440
every single famous dutch thing every

710
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,158
single famous 90s strain was

711
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,759
was bought seeds were bought and and

712
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,720
people sold their own versions of it

713
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,558
really fast yeah

714
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,480
right so what's been going on from the

715
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,798
but what i'm scared of is all of a

716
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,079
sudden someone telling me that like

717
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,960
oh no we we we own the chem d

718
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,918
yeah

719
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,159
we own the 91 we own them we own this we

720
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,520
don't you know whatever

721
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,039
you know so it's like if you make

722
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,798
something in the legal market if you

723
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,400
have a legal nursery and you make your

724
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,158
own breed and you and you do something

725
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,519
like that to it maybe it starts to get

726
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,360
different

727
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,278
yeah but all the stuff that came out of

728
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,359
the shadows all the stuff that came out

729
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,440
of prohibition the whole genetic library

730
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,119
of everything else it's it should be i'm

731
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
not owned by anybody

732
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,278
i agree

733
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,678
and and you know and um and that'll that

734
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,919
that that'll really democratize it you

735
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,559
know case in point like i i do like

736
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,159
having action with words and with the

737
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,720
blue bonnet mail

738
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,320
after i made the lines and literally

739
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,319
immediately after i gave it to radio

740
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,918
ridge to to have it open source for any

741
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,439
breeder who wants to inject blueberry

742
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,440
into their lines you know what i mean

743
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,880
and i i try to stand behind that because

744
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
i think it

745
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,960
i really think if you're good at what

746
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,400
you do

747
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,079
you shouldn't tie yourself to one thing

748
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,960
and you should be able to make new and

749
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,960
unique and go new different directions

750
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,159
and be inspired by stuff like that and

751
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
if someone else makes something better

752
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,559
than you you should be able to look at

753
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:23,439
that admire it want to use it and better

754
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,960
it i mean you know i'm a matt is not at

755
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
all but i'm a huge i'm a big fan of the

756
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,558
grateful dead right yeah and one of the

757
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,038
reasons why

758
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,200
they have so many shows recorded

759
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,798
is you know and they've been they played

760
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,319
more shows than anybody and they and

761
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,960
there's more live recordings of them

762
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,558
than anybody they left tapers they had i

763
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
mean they made sound boards but they let

764
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,278
tapers set up in the audience

765
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,360
and they yeah and basically they said

766
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,278
after we play it it's theirs

767
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,359
that's beautiful

768
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,038
don't bootleg our albums

769
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,479
but our show as soon as we're done

770
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,240
playing it we played it for you it's

771
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,720
yours

772
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,400
and they were pretty much rock yes super

773
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,000
punk rock dude they were i mean they

774
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,400
came from prankster

775
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,960
you know from prankster ethics

776
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,840
warlocks it was a great garage band too

777
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,360
so

778
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,519
you know

779
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,359
uh yeah i mean someone just said i hear

780
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,960
a lot of the og lines were backseat all

781
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,879
og is backseat

782
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,759
so let's start it started with a bag

783
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,960
seed more bag seeds were created

784
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,278
um it's it's it's bag seeds of bag seeds

785
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,558
yeah it's it's accidental pollination

786
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,519
all the way up

787
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,079
yeah

788
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,000
you know so so that's what i think you

789
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,038
know there's and and maybe that's what

790
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,798
people can do people can fight to keep

791
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,079
even if you're gonna crop one or two

792
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:39,119
things for your little market or

793
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,199
whatever

794
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,879
save one or two other moms that you grow

795
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,480
a plan or two of every now and again and

796
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,278
you hold on to something that you care

797
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,200
about

798
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,798
yeah make it be something that you enjoy

799
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,319
smoking

800
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,918
follow you enjoy smoking it because

801
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,519
that's what keeps you keeping it that's

802
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,520
what keeps you keeping it you know and

803
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,119
like and then if and then if thousands

804
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,720
of different people hold on to one two

805
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,798
or three or four things that they love a

806
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,600
lot we'll have a lot more heirlooms that

807
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,278
make it yeah because it'll be a lot more

808
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,399
insulated from like

809
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,720
you know the the the too few collectors

810
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,798
like me you know who

811
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,400
like there's fires there's issues

812
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,639
there's accidents there's [ __ ] that can

813
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,240
happen you know the more diffused it is

814
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,278
the better the better chance we have

815
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,399
with stuff surviving absolutely

816
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,278
um before we continue someone did ask me

817
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:27,599
um

818
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,519
to talk about and give a kind of public

819
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,959
service announcement during these times

820
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,278
in cannabis and i think it's important

821
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,120
as well a lot of us have lost a lot of

822
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,960
people to suicide

823
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,439

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,679
like i live in uh obviously i live in

848

pound prices and and what's going on at

851
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,480
home right now um because it's the the

852
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,519
way of life is all of a sudden there's

853
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,599
an aspect of well how does one survive

854
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,119
yeah i have a mortgage i have kids i

855
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,038
have this i have that this has worked

856
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,719
for me for a lot of us

857
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,599
you know that are in our like you know

858
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,519
mid 30s to mid 40s or whatever this has

859
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,199
been working for us basically our whole

860
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,679
adult life

861
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,759
yeah yeah and now you know and now it's

862
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,159
changing dramatically i don't do

863
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,558
anything else good like really i like

864
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,320
that's not even just a statement like

865
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,319
this is what i have done most of my

866
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,519
adult life and the stuff that i used to

867
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,398
do

868
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,319
that's bypassed the technology bypassed

869
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,319
a long time ago and i think a lot of

870
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,398
people in our community that have stuck

871
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,119
at this for a long time that share that

872
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,798
and it's it's scary the the

873
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,199
not knowing what the future holds is

874
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,119
scary so talk about each other there

875
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,640
used to be this thing like with ptsd or

876
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,038
whatever where like getting busted was

877
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,720
like an occupational hazard right yeah

878
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,319
and it sucked when it happens and so we

879
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,079
used to be we used to get scared about

880
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,278
that to some degree and now

881
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,199
it's like you're not scared about

882
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,640
getting busted as much as you are like

883
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,960
just failing

884
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,799
yeah right and so and then that and then

885
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,120
that leads some people to like look

886
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,480
around to like you know get

887
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,798
sell out

888
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,960
yeah you know i'll i'll give you guys a

889
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:56,960
story of back home for a second right so

890
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,798
this is this is what used to happen when

891
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,120
we when the flood hit

892
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,960
okay and we used to call the flood is

893
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:06,079
when like the flood of outdoor really

894
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,798
hit the market yeah right and prices

895
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,558
dropped and not not like crazy like

896
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,558
today but but there be an aspect where

897
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,519
all of a sudden like we would be hard to

898
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,480
move

899
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,558
yeah

900
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,480
you know um and

901
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,000
and and the issue was it wasn't like it

902
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,759
was hard to move it was more like there

903
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,960
was just enough of it that like some of

904
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,879
it was moving and a lot of it was

905
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,919
sitting until some of more of it moved

906
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,159
right sure

907
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,480
and people would come up and talk to me

908
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,679
and literally like the brokers in

909
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,599
november or december are vampiric

910
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,240
yeah like they're like oh you have you

911
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,599
have fireweed and you have some savings

912
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,839
don't you have a buddy that's like three

913
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,678
months behind on the pg e christmas is

914
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,199
coming the wife's terrified they're two

915
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,640
months behind on their mortgage they got

916
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,038
a bunch of fireweed and they want to

917
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,880
make a dope deal yeah

918
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,240
and a lot of times

919
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,799
they didn't want to buy from anybody

920
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,240
that was stable for a couple of months

921
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:57,759
yeah because they wanted they wanted

922
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,599
they wanted to take advantage of the

923
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,200
poor planners and the people in a tight

924
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,639
spot where they could get a more

925
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,919
aggressive deal and they could make a

926
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,759
bunch more margin yeah

927
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,000
right i mean that was just that's just

928
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,679
like standard that standard business you

929
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,599
know and a lot of times people would you

930
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,759
know back in the day especially people

931
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,119
would bury their stuff or not trim it

932
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,558
till spring

933
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,639
and you know if you had money you

934
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,278
wouldn't sell it till february march

935
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,038
april may yeah

936
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,599
because that's when the flooded passed a

937
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,278
bit and the desperation was gone and

938
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,119
then they started coming up and looking

939
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,398
for just good packs

940
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,000
yeah and you know and so

941
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,678
you know there's always been sort of

942
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,119
like that the reason why i brought that

943
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,480
up is that

944
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,079
right now that's kind of what's

945
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,759
happening is people are looking at seed

946
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,158
collections people are looking at clone

947
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,319
collections people are looking around it

948
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,080
and they're like who's desperate who's

949
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,398
desperate what's the cheapest i can get

950
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,000
this out of this who's failing who's in

951
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,158
trouble who's stressed right because

952
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,440
you know um but you're right people are

953
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,440
saying it doesn't seem like a good way

954
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,880
to form long-term relationships that's

955
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,880
like you think if brokers and people

956
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,278
like that want long-term relationships

957
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,480
they want to win every trip to get what

958
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:09,359
they want

959
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
yeah

960
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,558
that's what they're really doing there's

961
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,240
not a bunch of the amount of people that

962
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:18,240
like want to form long-lasting

963
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,480
beneficial stable relationships that's

964
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,839
not really weed

965
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,960
you know brokers are like you know

966
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,558
they're like they have some stable

967
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,079
relationship with you and then they hear

968
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,240
that like some dude is broke and is

969
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,759
going to sell better weed for 400 less a

970
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,839
pound and

971
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,919
they're off that way yeah because that's

972
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,839
where that dude is

973
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,840
you know and so

974
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,439
you know and and you know and and so

975
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,918
there's a there's an aspect of that

976
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,440
where you know people people make fun of

977
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,559
like well you know california is all

978
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,798
boof

979
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,000
yeah and and there's an aspect of that

980
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,759
where there is a lot of booth in

981
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,359
california don't get me wrong

982
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,798
there's a lot of shitty weed and there's

983
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,319
even a lot of shitty weed in mendo and

984
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,119
humble it's like people are trying to

985
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,119
like brand legacy and brand that like

986
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,839
the area that i come from is like all

987
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,879
just

988
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,599
it's just all been triple a and loved on

989
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
yeah

990
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,319
that's not true either that was never

991
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,678
true um uh it's true in some cases you

992
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,278
know and everyone's trying to claim it

993
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,038
right now but it certainly wasn't true

994
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,679
for the most part people were plenty

995
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:18,158
content to grow okay weed and move it

996
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,720
yeah right so

997
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,919
there's an aspect there where like

998
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,798
um

999
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,759
you know

1000
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,440
but you know i i don't know it

1001
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,599
i'm not even sure where like my train of

1002
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,600
thought was going on oh i'll

1003
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,519
i'll give you something so

1004
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,839
we we were talking about solutions and i

1005
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,399
know like i kind of took it off in the

1006
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,480
not so solution oriented just mm-hmm

1007
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,158
this problem were you but

1008
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,399
one solution and you talked about it

1009
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,399
earlier was getting a bunch of people

1010
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,558
like-minded together and now with the

1011
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,278
syndicate what i originally

1012
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,918
what this was originally built for

1013
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:56,240
the big pie in the sky idea that i have

1014
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,000
for the syndicate overall

1015
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,000
first was to get everyone together

1016
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,839
that's interested in

1017
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,398
read history that's truly interested in

1018
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,639
it wants to learn get together we all

1019
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:09,519
make each other better but from there my

1020
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,720
ultimate goal is to have it be a sort of

1021
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,559
and i know people are going to [ __ ] some

1022
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,638
people flip a union

1023
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,918
for those who came before us they don't

1024
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,440
have retirements none of us have

1025
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,440
retirements that are weak growers like

1026
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,559
that are you know traditional

1027
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
um

1028
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,878
have

1029
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,918
fallbacks for that

1030
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,598
have retirement plans for these people

1031
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,279
we have to form it ourselves no one's

1032
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,679
going to form it for us and in the only

1033
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,359
way we can do that is working together

1034
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,280
and it sucks because a lot of us won't

1035
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:36,799
work together but i think over time a

1036
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,560
lot of the the old school dudes the

1037
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,919
people that really care and people that

1038
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,078
used to butt heads even me and fletcher

1039
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,398
used to butt heads we don't we're we're

1040
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,399
cool because we all have that same kind

1041
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,799
of thought and goal so that that was the

1042
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,279
overall goal solution

1043
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,280
whatever i saw as my story i want to

1044
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,119
expound on that but i did gather my

1045
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,519
train of thought like 10 seconds after

1046
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,039
you started talking so

1047
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,320
the point i was trying to make is that

1048
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,920
like for all the people that are

1049
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,760
complaining about all this california

1050
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,519
booth that hits their town

1051
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,920
the only reason why that's happening is

1052
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,358
because the broker that got it here and

1053
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,720
brought it to there

1054
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,358
thinks that you don't have better

1055
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:16,159
options and he can force boof on you for

1056
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:17,519
a good margin for himself yeah that's

1057
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,759
why there's beef everywhere if you're

1058
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,320
angry at california booth don't blame

1059
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,160
california blame the dude the dudes in

1060
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,559
your area that arranged for that to

1061
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,879
appear in your area yeah

1062
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,199
and there's tons

1063
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,920
of pretty good weed in california

1064
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,519
and there's some really exceptional lead

1065
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,760
and you could force your brokers to

1066
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,519
bring you that

1067
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,880
you know and then according to what like

1068
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,239
matt's saying too

1069
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,920
is

1070
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,959
matt and i battle all this all the time

1071
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,280
but like

1072
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,400
i what matt just said is basically like

1073
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,720
we need a really big tent

1074
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,320
we need whether it's a union or whatever

1075
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,838
else you know people are gonna laugh at

1076
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,720
that for a second but really what we

1077
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:01,199
need is we need millions of people that

1078
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:04,879
get on board with the basic ideas that

1079
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:08,078
we think should cannabis should be

1080
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,760
and then to push for those ideas

1081
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,680
and then in some fashion eventually

1082
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,280
we'll probably get at least a niche of

1083
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,480
our ideas functioning the way that we

1084
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
want to

1085
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,400
yeah right but if but we're really good

1086
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:23,279
at fighting at one another uh cannabis

1087
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,039
uh used to be it's not so much anymore

1088
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,800
but cannabis used to be a great place

1089
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,800
where people with some mental illnesses

1090
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,320
that were untreated could make a decent

1091
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,640
living for themselves

1092
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,640
yes

1093
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,239
and so

1094
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,559
and so you know and and you could say

1095
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,559
you know and i mean i i know in mendo i

1096
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,960
know like single moms that like you know

1097
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:45,119
just like grab grab some courage and

1098
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,639
went for it in the hills yeah and they

1099
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,760
were able to spend a lot of time with

1100
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,559
their kids

1101
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,320
growing weed right and making a living

1102
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,838
for themselves and there's a bunch of

1103
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,920
people that would have a hard time

1104
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,759
working a normal job

1105
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,960
yeah right and so so we interact with

1106
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,280
these people

1107
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,519
and then they don't [ __ ] act normal

1108
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,280
yeah you know and and then as time just

1109
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,119
gets tough for them too they start to

1110
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,599
freak out and they start to get [ __ ]

1111
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,680
and [ __ ] starts getting weird

1112
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,359
so you know but

1113
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:16,000
you know when it comes down to it too

1114
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,920
like people people with issues like they

1115
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,159
have a right to a living too

1116
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,838
yeah weed was a safe space for a lot of

1117
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:26,239
people despite the risks yeah it was

1118
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,358
you know and it's changing now

1119
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,039
you know uh it's it's changing and so as

1120
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,400
a result of that like there's a bunch of

1121
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,880
stress out there

1122
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,639
yeah um but we're really gonna have to

1123
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,440
like there i see a ton of fighting

1124
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:42,239
people if people notice like i really i

1125
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,000
don't fight on instagram you know i try

1126
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,838
to be polite to people i'm trying to

1127
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,320
build consensus

1128
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,838
i want more people like yeah i might be

1129
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,760
way too polite or whatever and sometimes

1130
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,519
i have to eat [ __ ] or whatever and not

1131
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,280
take the bait and people are insulting

1132
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,960
or whatnot you know but that's

1133
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
at the end of the day that's their

1134
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,320
problem not mine

1135
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,679
yeah it's only my problem if i give a

1136
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,680
[ __ ] what they think

1137
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,960
that's very true which i don't because

1138
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,879
why would i care what you think when i

1139
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,320
don't even know who you are

1140
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,760
and i don't know what you do in life and

1141
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,039
i don't know what your vibe is and i

1142
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,480
don't know what your ethics are one of

1143
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,880
my good friends has an issue with me of

1144

1145
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,760
some stranger on the internet that's

1146
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
pissed off because i don't like somebody

1147
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,079

1149

can go to whatever

1150
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,079
convert them however you like man

1151
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,159
whatever technique it takes whatever it

1152
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:33,159
is

1153
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,250
you know you do you do you uh in that

1154
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,880
regard

1155
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,639
[Laughter]

1156
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,760
hey i'm good at what i'm good at bro

1157
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:46,480
yeah you know it works you know so

1158
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,560
so there's an aspect there where um we

1159
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,559
want better weed we want access to

1160
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,759
better weed we don't want it to be we

1161
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:53,358
don't want all these strains and

1162
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,680
everything else to be totally controlled

1163
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,960
by people because that will stifle

1164
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,279
innovation

1165
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,519
yeah you know hobby breeders and small

1166
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,280
rooms are where almost all of the best

1167
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,280
new strains come from

1168
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,160
yeah they're not gonna come from these

1169
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,160
[ __ ] chris compound female hunts or

1170
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,440
[ __ ] did this person or that they're

1171
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,480
just i don't think they're gonna come

1172
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,720
from there

1173
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,320
people are gonna hype [ __ ] right and we

1174
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,838
both know that like you know we have

1175
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,079
friends and stuff most of those people

1176
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,759
are hype beasts anyway and they have way

1177
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,599
smaller breeders making their [ __ ] for

1178
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,359
them and doing the actual stuff

1179
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,559
that works you know we don't need to i

1180
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,319
don't want to say a bunch of names or

1181
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,239
whatever has just slipped out but the

1182
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,519
fact remains is that there's way better

1183
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,959
chance for one of you guys with a

1184
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,800
[ __ ] eight lighter

1185
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,119
right to come out with the next sour

1186
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,160
diesel than like one of these big legal

1187
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,358
spots

1188
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,879
yep

1189
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,719
but the only way that's gonna happen is

1190
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,400
you have to grow good weed and you have

1191
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,879
to keep good weed in your room and you

1192
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,039
have to keep weed you love in your room

1193
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,039
the best weed comes out of weed you love

1194
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,118
right and so like people were asking

1195
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,880
earlier like how many how many how many

1196
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,838
moms i have and it varies a bunch but

1197
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,800
it's like

1198
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,679
my mom collection is really odd

1199
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,640
yeah

1200
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,318
i'm very

1201
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,598
when people ask me that i'm immediately

1202
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,880
like why you want to know my plan

1203
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,800
account yeah i mean i'm not i'm not

1204
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,400
gonna that's that's i'm not i just i

1205
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,000
just meant in the sense that like

1206
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,240
you know because like some number

1207
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,800
matters or whatever but like there's an

1208
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,959
aspect where it's it's heavily based on

1209
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,359
what i personally like

1210
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,760
yeah whether from a breeding perspective

1211
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,920
or whether from a uh you know a smoke

1212
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,839
perspective or a combination or whatever

1213
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,119
so as a result there's certain things

1214
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:30,639
that are kind of famous that i don't

1215
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,079
really have a bunch of their a bunch of

1216
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,559
variations of it

1217
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,000
yeah because i don't care about it

1218
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,599
you know that's for other people to care

1219
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,159
about i like what i like

1220
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,240
it's already overwhelming enough just to

1221
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,759
try to hold on to what i like yeah it's

1222
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,358
really hard to hold on to [ __ ] you don't

1223
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,400
like

1224
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:47,519
you know

1225
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,760
it's tough

1226
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,920
yeah you know it becomes tough and so i

1227
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,720
don't expect everybody to try to like go

1228
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,440
go crazy and have like big collections

1229
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,118
but a lot of diversity can be saved by

1230
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,318
people just doing one two three four

1231
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,318
five things yep

1232
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,279
um do i hold anything that i'm not a fan

1233
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,200
of but as a backup for a friend yeah

1234
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,200
there's a couple of things are there

1235
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,118
some things that are untested

1236
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,519
are there some things that like if i

1237
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,680
have a close enough friend and they love

1238
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,679
something a ton and they want help

1239
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,879
backing it up i understand that

1240
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,159
motivation

1241
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,280
sure

1242
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,960
you know um doesn't don't deluge me with

1243
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,280
like favorites that you want me to hold

1244
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,559
on to please god be good but but yeah if

1245
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,000
you're a good enough friend of mine or

1246
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,199
whatever there could be something that

1247
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,480
because that's how that's how all this

1248
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,519
stuff survives

1249
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,880
yeah

1250
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:40,639
is uh it is is of his friends helping

1251
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,480
friends back things up

1252
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:46,078
and that insulates you from like angry

1253
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,920
exes and accidents and fires and you

1254
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,240
know all the stupid [ __ ] that can

1255
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,240
[ __ ] make you lose your [ __ ]

1256
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,318
how about making s-ones if you can't

1257
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,118
hold cut it's a great idea

1258
00:41:54,318 --> 00:42:00,559
um it is advanced breeding so if you're

1259
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,358
new to making crosses if you're new to

1260
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,920
identifying males identifying females if

1261
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,400
you're not familiar with an intersex

1262
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,720
plant and even when you're using uh

1263
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,559
sprays like that like my reversal spring

1264
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:15,118
for example you can find rideseats.com

1265
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:17,119
you can go get that and when you spray

1266
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,838
it it doesn't necessarily look like a

1267
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,838
male it looks like a female expressing

1268
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,599
his mail so if you're not familiar with

1269
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,838
seeing that i recommend doing your

1270
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,240
research digging up you can always go to

1271
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,000
our patreon join the crew

1272
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:31,279
we're always talking about stuff like

1273
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,599
this we're going to have a private

1274
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,760
conversation in a in a few days on

1275
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,280
reversals and reversal techniques for

1276
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,640
small groups so they can get really good

1277
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,960
questions in

1278
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,639
but i mean s1s are a great way to backup

1279
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,559
seeds but understand that just because

1280
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,400
you're reversing it or s wanting it or

1281
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,039
selling it you're not going to have an

1282
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,880
exact clone representation of the mom so

1283
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,119
do understand that but it's an excellent

1284
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,800
way to back up the pure version of those

1285
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,519
genetics

1286
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,720
um people are asking a bunch of stuff

1287
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,800
that that that is um

1288
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:03,759
that yes all those things that you said

1289
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,359
are good

1290
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,520
um we are going to be having some like

1291
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,279
more more concentrated talks with people

1292
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,358
which is nice

1293
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,280
people are asking about super skunk

1294
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,119
stuff like that i don't know i mean i

1295
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,519
i'm not one to like shout from the

1296
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,000
rooftops you know or anything like that

1297
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,559
um there i do think there's hope that

1298
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,318
that uh some of these old things exist

1299
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,880
um but i think they should be like grown

1300
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,559
out and tested and and sorted out on

1301
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,800
that level first

1302
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,318
um i think uh you know a lot of times

1303
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,839
when people get like cuts or whatever

1304
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,639
and they're convinced that it's some 30

1305
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:39,039
year old thing and they flex it

1306
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:41,279
you know i mean grow it out

1307
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,358
yeah see what's that's important it's

1308
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,040
important and not just to grow it out

1309
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:46,480
and it's cool like if you grow it out

1310
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,480
and you're like damn this is dank that

1311
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,838
must be [ __ ] that must be it but that's

1312
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,599
not necessarily the case just because

1313
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:52,880
the stink doesn't mean it's legitimately

1314
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,160
what you think it is so if you're gonna

1315
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,559
grow it out and you're going to assess

1316
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,759
provenance and if it's real make sure

1317
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,838
you know

1318
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,839
about it have anything knowledge about

1319
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,759
it and don't just assume because it's

1320
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:07,440
dank that it's legit

1321
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,200
yeah and you know and and so there's

1322
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,639
someone asked what's the closest thing

1323
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,639
to super skunk and seed cheesel

1324
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:18,239
diesel

1325
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,279
or diesel yeah diesel diesel diesel

1326
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,959
diesel

1327
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,560
diesels and diesels

1328
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,480
i've said a bunch of times before i kind

1329
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,480
of consider the diesel family to be like

1330
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,240
a modern skunk

1331
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,079
you know it's not exactly super skunk

1332
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,559
diesel is much closer to modern super

1333
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,079
skunk to like an actual pure super skunk

1334
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,679
but in terms of like a

1335
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,440
very skunky

1336
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,118
like and i don't mean like necessarily

1337
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,119
in terps but i'm just in terms of like

1338
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,519
the way it forms and the way it grows

1339
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,880
and a lot of the factors to that like i

1340
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,679
think sours

1341
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,640
sours and diesels um have various ranges

1342
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,199
of that

1343
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,118
yeah you know um and so there's plenty

1344
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,879
luckily that there's a plethora it seems

1345
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,160
like of sour cuts right now about

1346
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,440
[ __ ]

1347
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,279
i don't know

1348
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,639
three dozen or something like that at

1349
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,359
all

1350
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:05,920
they all tie back to 1995 so it's really

1351
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,440
amazing that like out of nowhere like 36

1352
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,200
different individual cuts that are all

1353
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,519
the real deal have popped up in two

1354
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,519
years

1355
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,399
um

1356
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,920
but uh yeah you know so i mean when

1357
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,680
people talk about super skunk too

1358
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,318
there's plenty of super skunk in modern

1359
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,919
weed and like matt said diesel is almost

1360
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,079
a pure super skunk

1361
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,559
people are a great example what what

1362
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,039
people are are you know really saying is

1363
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,199
that like super skunk phenos that like

1364
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,279
have ranks skunk

1365
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,799
tur like aromas

1366
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,280
that's the missing link but there's

1367
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,318
plenty of like like ex physical

1368
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,000
expressions of super skunk yeah you know

1369
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,440
in the way the flower forms and the way

1370
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,519
the leaves are and the way you know

1371
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,000
various aspects of the traits of it it's

1372
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,759
it's in a lot of stuff yes

1373
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,358
you know so

1374
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,440
um and you know there's a thing two

1375
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:58,000
people are asking what's we like

1376
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,000
i'm not i'm you know i'm not trying to

1377
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,079
knock anybody's stuff but i can say that

1378
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,239
like when i started collecting sour

1379
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,480
diesels to compare to my sour diesel cut

1380
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,159
that i had to figure out what name i

1381
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,599
should attach to the one that i've held

1382
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,639
for a long time

1383
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,079
um

1384
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,039
probably in the that was like what was

1385
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,400
that like five or six years ago matt yep

1386
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,400
at this point

1387
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,800
there's probably like half a dozen or

1388
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,039
eight six or eight new names that i knew

1389
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,079
that were never in the forums yeah did

1390
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,920
you ever hear about albany sour diesel

1391
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,480
did you ever hear about weasel's sour

1392
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,480
diesel cut on the forums

1393
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,079
did you ever hear about like the the you

1394
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,599
know i mean so they're and i'm not i'm

1395
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,800
not knocking these things out i didn't

1396
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,119
read the cop diesel yeah

1397
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,160
so i'm just i'm just saying that like

1398
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,640
there's new like nicknames added to

1399
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,039
hours probably half a dozen or more just

1400
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:51,598
within the last three or four years that

1401
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,639
10 years ago you never heard about

1402
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,400
yeah

1403
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,159
right and so what does that you know are

1404
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,079
they the same as other things are they

1405
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,799
the choco are they the amish are they

1406
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,318
the

1407
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,400
this or the who knows

1408
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,318
i think every time you see someone

1409
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,559
release a seed line that's hyped and

1410
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,239
named after a cut in the form like the

1411
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:09,920
sour diesel we saw several different

1412
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,318
breeders released their versions of sour

1413
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,039
diesel i think that's when you see a lot

1414
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,000
of

1415
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,759
old cuts pop up and stuff yeah people's

1416
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
poppings and selections of brand new

1417
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,640
lines that they think is legit enough to

1418
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,719
pass for the old i mean luckily for

1419
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,519
people most diesel cuts are pretty damn

1420
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:26,719
nice

1421
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,239
yes

1422
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,239
they smoke good they get you nice and

1423
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,759
high suck it growing and then it'll be

1424
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,519
boost

1425
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,200
because i've sucked at growing diesels

1426
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,519
before and it's been fun

1427
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,639
diesels can be finicky and they can be

1428
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,318
punishing

1429
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,480
and they can not be that great but

1430
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,318
that's i mean there's so there's

1431
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,480
um so there's an aspect where there's i

1432
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:48,800
mean maybe i exaggerated with 36 cuts

1433
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,000
but there's probably at least 15

1434
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,119
18

1435
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,760
named cuts a lot of which claimed to be

1436
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,358
close to original uh i love pot asked

1437
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,640
what names are legit

1438
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,480
that's the thing names aren't

1439
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,799
necessarily legit it's the cuts that are

1440
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,800
legit anybody can call anybody cut

1441
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,960
anybody's cut any name so just because

1442
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,720
someone calls something the charcoal cut

1443
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,639
doesn't necessarily mean that it's legit

1444
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,799
because they called it the chocolate

1445
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,838
it's kind of like how we called we

1446
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,200
called it the dog and until our buddy

1447
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,838
got online

1448
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,519
and you know and then it got named after

1449
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:22,558
his online handle

1450
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,480
yeah

1451
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,800
because he was the person passing it out

1452
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,199
and you know who you know the amish was

1453
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,160
passed out by was shroomie right

1454
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,078
yeah

1455
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,879
you know and the child and like so

1456
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,800
things got named on the internet taco i

1457
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,880
called the choco because he had some of

1458
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,559
my favorite pictures of it and they were

1459
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,680
some of the best pictures for showing

1460
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,760
people to describe which cut i had so it

1461
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,440
was called ecsd but i said it's the one

1462
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,559
that choco shows the chocolate and it

1463
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,559
just eventually

1464
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,119
that's how that name formed the choco

1465
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,200
cut what's that yeah and and you know

1466
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,440
and then there's you know there's

1467
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:00,000
you know east coast sour diesel new york

1468
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,318
sour diesel you know all these

1469
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,480
um so there was like a first wave in the

1470
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,880
beginning it was just called sour

1471
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,119
yeah it wasn't really until the forums

1472
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,200
and like the mid-2000s that names

1473
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,119
started getting applied to sour diesel

1474
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,799
yeah and then there was a batch of names

1475
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,960
and now there's a new batch of names

1476
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,680
what what really really is happening is

1477
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,000
that most people have not held their

1478
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,679
sour diesel cut consistently throughout

1479
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,079
the eras

1480
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,759
so you're trying to figure out what name

1481
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,519
is the one that ties back to what you

1482
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,760
want but it's really hard when you lose

1483
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,358
chain of command when you lose chain of

1484
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,280
who has what when

1485
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,880
yeah matt and i talk about provenance or

1486
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,359
whatever right so

1487
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,358
here's the provenance of my sour cut i

1488
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:47,039
got it 22 years ago and i never lost it

1489
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,960
do i know what it is before i got it no

1490
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,960
you know do i know how what where it

1491
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,318
went and how it went between you know

1492
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,400
the mid 90s and when i got it in 2000 no

1493
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,558
but i haven't lost it

1494
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,240
and eventually if you don't lose things

1495
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,480
like you know that if you hold on to

1496
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,479
things for a long time then it sort of

1497
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,838
becomes like that's part of the reason

1498
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,240
why i never tried to use other sours

1499
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,078
i had sour diesel

1500
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,358
why did i get a different one i had the

1501
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,119
one i didn't know there were i didn't

1502
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,719
even know there was a bunch i got sour

1503
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,599
diesel i was happy with it it was great

1504
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,239
wheat

1505
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,280
so why would i go trade someone for it

1506
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:22,239
yeah

1507
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,519
you know

1508
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,639
um and people are like what's the

1509
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,800
difference between the two nycd and ecsd

1510
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:30,960
cuts i think he's probably referring to

1511
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,400
nycd from soma i don't think most people

1512
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,679
know about the other one uh yeah

1513
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,639
someone's talking about the millie i

1514
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:36,719
don't know if mine's the millie that

1515
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:38,719
dude that has the million he got he got

1516
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,719
his the same year i got mine in the same

1517
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,118
place i got mine which was the bay area

1518
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:45,439
of california but we've never exchanged

1519
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,280
cuts or grown side by side to test i

1520
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,280
couldn't tell you but some people would

1521
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,920
use that as enough info to say yes in

1522
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,000
fact that is the same cut yeah i mean

1523
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,599
and you know and so you know he calls it

1524
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,199
the the millie because it's short for

1525
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,440
millennium because he got it at the turn

1526
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,759
of the millennium yeah

1527
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,679
you know um but with diesels i don't

1528
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,200
really think it's it's a fair comparison

1529
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,440
unless you grow them in the same room at

1530
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,799
the same time same greenhouse same

1531
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,639
outdoor

1532
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,318
treat it the same feed it the same and

1533
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,759
then you'll see differences if there are

1534
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:14,800
and if it's the same cut it'll be the

1535
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,880
same cut

1536
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,760
yeah but i can't i can't compare

1537
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,000
somebody's led living soil grow in a

1538
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,880
different conditions to somebody else's

1539
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,960
and if they just come out too different

1540
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,640
in in my you know and sometimes with the

1541
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,880
same person they come out different crop

1542
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,039
to crop

1543
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,440
new york city diesel isn't dutch booth

1544
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:38,159
it is weird and shitty in the sense that

1545
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,079
soma took the diesel name and was one of

1546
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:41,838
the first people to offer seeds and it

1547
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,720
was some euro

1548
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:47,358
fruity thing crossed to possibly a sour

1549
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:50,959
bag seed if you want to believe him 99

1550
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:53,119
hybrid it's grapefruit

1551
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,039
but um people have found some nice

1552
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,000
phenos on it it's nothing like sour

1553
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,079
diesel

1554
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,119
yeah the good ones aren't like sour

1555
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,160
diesel

1556
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,400
so

1557
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,639
uh someone's asking about master kush my

1558
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,480
boy bitters got a killer version of uh

1559
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,598
master kush which is the socal master

1560
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,719
kush across to the hogs breath and he's

1561
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,079
just

1562
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:14,879
running through those it's an old scene

1563
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,960
line um but yeah i'm stoked to see it

1564
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,720
back i'm stoked to see some uh socal

1565
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,159
master back in the forum with i'm not

1566
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,759
gonna i can't really i'm not gonna

1567
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:23,039
engage a ton on like what all the

1568
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,720
different names are because one of the

1569
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,039
things that i found with sour names is

1570
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,598
like they get applied to a variety of

1571
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:33,039
different cuts at different times

1572
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:35,760
um and it's it's really difficult uh to

1573
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:38,960
try to figure out uh sour diesel

1574
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,640
yeah you know um so i don't i don't know

1575
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,318
how i don't know how like i don't know

1576
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,838
how to go back on that one or whatever

1577
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,838
and even the headband and a lot of these

1578
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,440
things that i've held for a long time

1579
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:48,558
there's still more mystery than i would

1580
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,679
like

1581
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,040
sure

1582
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:52,879
i'm just willing to say that there's

1583
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,920
mystery to it rather than like craft

1584
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,000
some story of certainty when that exists

1585
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,920
yeah stories sound so much better when

1586
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,159
they're full of intrigue and mystery but

1587
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,920
yeah that's just how it goes

1588
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,199
you know and so i mean i've had people

1589
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,119
tell me like people someone just said

1590
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:09,199
the albany cuts totally legit i know

1591
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,280
someone that's had it since 99

1592
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,118
people have told me people have told me

1593
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,240
my some of my weed is spread out a

1594
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,079
little bit and some people have been

1595
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,679
trying it and liking it some people have

1596
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,680
told me that they think that the cut

1597
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:22,078
that i have is the albany for whatever

1598
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,000
that's worth but i mean i i haven't

1599
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,200
gotten it i don't have any confirmation

1600
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,559
of it i

1601
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,399
you know i think a lot of people are

1602
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,559
throwing a lot of different names at the

1603
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,838
wall and trying to figure out which is

1604
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,880
cool because

1605
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:33,920
um

1606
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,920
you know at least there's a bunch of

1607
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,599
interest in it sour diesel is way better

1608
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,760
weed than a lot of the weed that's being

1609
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,760
traded right now a lot of the hype boy

1610
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,040
weed so it should have a moment in the

1611
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,000
sun

1612
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,679
yeah

1613
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,280
you know um somebody said there's a

1614
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:49,519
master there's two like the only thing

1615
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,720
i'll say about master kush is that

1616
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,119
it seems like there was a there's a

1617
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,799
socal master kush that seems

1618
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,440
cushy but it's kind of a bubba-ish

1619
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,680
hybrid in my opinion um and then there's

1620
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,880
a there was a master kush that we had up

1621
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,759
north that was much leggier darker

1622
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,079
thinner

1623
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,680
um type of thing and it wasn't all that

1624
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,559
frosty but it might have like my

1625
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:13,118
favorite math

1626
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:16,079
i saw a lot of master kush grown on the

1627
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,240
forums from nirvana that was the

1628
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,960
majority of master kush i'd seen and it

1629
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:24,399
was a lot of like big short squat

1630
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,240
baseball bat not just fat [ __ ] short

1631
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,920
squat afghanis and there was a lot of

1632
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:30,239
that in the in the

1633
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,880
uh mid to late 2000s from

1634
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,639
um nirvana being grown i remember that i

1635
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,798
had uh someone just said that's the one

1636
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:38,960
not so i i had that cut for probably 10

1637
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:41,440
years i lost it when i got some troubles

1638
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,159
i got it back but it was super dutted

1639
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,039
and barely drank and and you know it's

1640
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,118
uh

1641
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,039
um so we lost it again but

1642
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,798
um i hope that i have it there's a

1643
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,798
chance it still floats around oregon

1644
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,239
somewhere i have some friends that gave

1645
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:55,838
it out and i'm hoping that like it'll

1646
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,679
pop up one day

1647
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,279
it's really flavorful some people didn't

1648
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,199
like it as much as far as brokers

1649
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,920
because it was a little darker and

1650
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,519
wasn't as as poppy in the bag as certain

1651
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,358
other ogs

1652
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:08,480
but man had a great high and it tasted

1653
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:10,558
good

1654
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,639
but most people seem to have the socal

1655
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,519
master that some that it's also really

1656
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,239
nice

1657
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:18,079
but it's nice so it's a bubba yeah it's

1658
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,519
very very nice i like it a lot i'm not

1659
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,599
trying to dis it at all it's just not

1660
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:24,559
the one that i'm familiar with and it

1661
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,280
seems very bubba based it is very bubble

1662
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,160
based it it is it is a dead ringer for

1663
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,040
bubba yeah it's it's it's bubba with

1664
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,838
some

1665
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,199
i don't think it has coffee terps like

1666
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:38,159
bubba it can depending on how you grow

1667
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:40,078
it really yeah it's a lot of soapy a lot

1668
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,679
of earthy but it can hit coffee it

1669
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,400
depends how to grow it

1670
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:46,239
well this is the iron og cut is around

1671
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,559
various collectors and people have it i

1672
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:49,558
read two

1673
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,519
yes

1674
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,798
that's the one that still exists that's

1675
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,838
the one that still exists and you know

1676
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:02,480
the the bubba the original bubba is lost

1677
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,078
as far as i know what survives is the

1678
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,480
bubba kush

1679
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,480
yes which was which is uh which we

1680
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,639
believe is a hybrid of the original

1681
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,920
bubba and the first kush cut that came

1682
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,199
to la

1683
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,039
yeah

1684
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:16,798
a seed found in that i don't think the

1685
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,558
origin no one no one's told me that the

1686
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:20,798
original bubba even exists it was a it

1687
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:24,559
was it was a funny looking thing

1688
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:27,838
yeah um which is a shame you know

1689
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:30,160
uh because uh you know like i said um

1690
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,759
preservation is hard and a lot of people

1691
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:34,000
get rid of a lot of things thinking it's

1692
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,880
going to be easier to get it back

1693
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,599
and then they realize they can't find it

1694
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,440
um someone's asking it's if hl the

1695
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,440
hopslate and viroid is something that's

1696
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,280
always been in cannabis and the answer

1697
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,079
to that

1698
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,920
we'll cover that on on september 8th

1699
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,480
with uh tubey

1700
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,880
um to me is the the company that we're

1701
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,838
going to be bringing on but the short

1702
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,039
answer is

1703
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:02,078
no it we know exactly when it came and

1704
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,239
hit cannabis and who did it

1705
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,960
somebody uh just asked if i met the guy

1706
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:09,199
that gave me the mendo perps would i

1707
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,760
would i grow them like i did back then

1708
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,598
enthusiastically and would you trust him

1709
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,400
um

1710
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,960
so

1711
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,039
that's interesting uh

1712
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,159
back then i grew water culture total

1713
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,000
hydro

1714
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:23,440
uh so it's very unlikely that i would

1715
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,039
grow them back then

1716
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,200
uh like like

1717
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,920
like now i have a little bit different

1718
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,279
methods now um but uh

1719
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,798
sure i would grow them just as

1720
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,319
enthusiastically

1721
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,400
um

1722
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,159
there's no doubt that there's a lot more

1723
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,838
lying going on

1724
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:45,519
about ancient strains uh now than there

1725
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:48,639
ever was in 1998. in 1998 nobody gave a

1726
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:51,519
[ __ ] uh there wasn't a fam unity to

1727
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:54,639
impress on any level you know and so

1728
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:56,318
there was less lying uh and even then

1729
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,000
he didn't tell me very much at all about

1730
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,119
it the only reason why i have a tendency

1731
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,559
to believe

1732
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,119
um that

1733
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,760
it could be as old as he thinks it is or

1734
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,200
he thought it was is because it's low

1735
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,359
thc

1736
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,838
it's got a crazy wide amount of

1737
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:13,838
diversity in its genes

1738
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:16,159
you know uh and it doesn't seem like

1739
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:17,440
it's related to anything else we know

1740
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,759
yeah

1741
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,079
you know so sometimes the plant backs up

1742
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,079
the story better than

1743
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,880
but there's a there's an unbelievable

1744
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,039
amount of [ __ ] right now with

1745
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,960
ancient seeds and ancient cuts and

1746
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,798
random [ __ ] and it's

1747
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,159
there's a renewed interest in old things

1748
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:37,039
which is wonderful

1749
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:39,838
um but uh that's led to an enormous

1750
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:39,838
amount of scamming

1751
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,400
an enormous amount and i just don't

1752
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,159
think that in 98 99 2000 2001 there was

1753
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,838
no extra money and nobody cared so i

1754
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:51,440
don't think there was nearly as

1755
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:53,119
a reason to lie it just bothers me too

1756
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,519
because and i'm not gonna say any names

1757
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,200
but people are selling

1758
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,920
people

1759
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,239
in

1760
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,880
maybe it's a big word but dreams it's

1761
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:06,558
like things that you haven't had that

1762
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,240
you can't quite verify

1763
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,720
but you want and you're willing to spend

1764
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:11,439
good money on and that's when they sell

1765
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,118
you

1766
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,798
that's how they sell

1767
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,920
that's how they work

1768
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,838
yeah

1769
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,000
um he asked because we're talking about

1770
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:22,719
swapping genetics and trusting people

1771
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,400
trusting people these days is hard

1772
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,879
you know um

1773
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,960
yeah and and there's not it's it's not

1774
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,119
as easy i mean a lot of times

1775
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,760
you know you have to grow things out and

1776
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,519
then share that share pics and share

1777
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,960
this and that and try to make your best

1778
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,119
judgments

1779
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,798
our buddy csi grows out old seeds from

1780
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,280
people all the time

1781
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,199
yeah and just kind of lets it lets it

1782
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,079
lets the plants show him what it shows

1783
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:47,039
him

1784
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,880
yes

1785
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,798
right and then and then he starts to

1786
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,880
believe or disbelief

1787
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:53,920
um someone's asking about tennessee stud

1788
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,720
that's a

1789
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,440
it was the g13 nl2 from neville

1790
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,838
cross to blue bonnet

1791
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:06,559
and pips we did the selection for the

1792
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:09,119
keeper that we used in the g13 nlc seats

1793
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:12,319
we have to say names eventually i've

1794
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,079
said names for so many years and frankly

1795
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:15,759
it hasn't made much of a difference um

1796
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,119
if you if you're interested in names if

1797
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,400
you're interested in wanting to get it

1798
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,000
right if you're interested in all this

1799
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,639
stuff

1800
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,480
the discord that's just where it is like

1801
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:27,039
if you if you're really interested in

1802
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,358
that kind that detailed kind of info

1803
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:31,838
join the patreon discord you'll get

1804
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,519
plenty of info and then some and then

1805
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:35,358
part of the reason why

1806
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:36,880
um part of the reason why we have that

1807
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,199
kind of approach and we're hesitant to

1808
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,400
mention some of the names on the chats

1809
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:42,078
is because

1810
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,920
like we'll be talking about some wider

1811
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,160
subject and matter i or somebody will

1812
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,280
make a offhand comment about someone

1813
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,759
specific

1814
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,240
and then 10 people will send like a 15

1815
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,760
second audio message of just that to

1816
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:55,519
that person and then they're all butt

1817
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,640
hurt or their whatever it's taken out of

1818
01:00:55,519 --> 01:01:00,880
context or they're doxing me or whatever

1819
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:03,759
yeah yeah and so and and so there's an

1820
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,720
aspect of there's an aspect of uh you

1821
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,040
know

1822
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:09,039
of wanting to keep it a little bit more

1823
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,798
like highbrow and wanting to keep it

1824
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:13,519
focused on the subject

1825
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:15,119
and not just uh and and you know not

1826
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:17,519
using somebody as an example and then

1827
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,519
they feel unfairly singled out

1828
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,679
yeah in certain rare cases when i think

1829
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:24,000
it's like crazy enough behavior

1830
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:26,000
um i mean i'll just say it but the point

1831
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,679
to these talks is to like educate people

1832
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,358
and stuff like that not so much to just

1833
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,480
sit there and like vent a bunch of

1834
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:32,239
grievances

1835
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,159
yeah that's easy to do to sit there and

1836
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:37,598
bend a bunch of grievances and it's

1837
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:39,920
really easy to sit there and talk about

1838
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,838
things that will make you money

1839
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,318
but it's not super easy to talk about

1840
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:47,039
history so somebody just yeah somebody

1841
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:50,558
just asked if g13 and nl2 is still

1842
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:53,279
available and no no no um i gave the

1843
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:57,200
rest of those seeds to a seed bank

1844
01:01:53,280 --> 01:02:00,559
and they passed them out and didn't put

1845
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:02,078
they mixed up packages named them abcd

1846
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,599
so they just got spread throughout i

1847
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,480
don't know which is which some people

1848
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:09,359
have them and may not even know it um it

1849
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,199
is labeled by a letter um and usually

1850
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,798
what happens is when people grow those

1851
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,318
out and i can see them i can usually

1852
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,079
tell what it is because they were all so

1853
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:17,920
different you know and there's an aspect

1854
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,880
too of one of the one of the reasons why

1855
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,838
uh

1856
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,838
um

1857
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,960
one of the reasons why i ask people to

1858
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,598
save stuff right

1859
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,519
is and hold on to these things is

1860
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,519
because every five or ten years cannabis

1861
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,759
really does realize

1862
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,440
yep and things that you think are common

1863
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,760
and aren't going to be around for a long

1864
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,519
time in many cases they don't

1865
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,839
yeah and the only way you can be

1866
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:43,199
absolutely sure to preserve it if you or

1867
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:44,159
your friends

1868
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,439
um

1869
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,118
you know uh

1870
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,720
if you or your friends help make sure

1871
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,920
you stave it you know

1872
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,439
and uh

1873
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,039
real quick uh

1874
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,639
i was talking with csi a lot of people

1875
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,960
been asking if we were going to continue

1876
01:02:54,639 --> 01:03:00,960
the northern lights project um with the

1877
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,960
nl1 nl2 the anal 2x5 that was sent by

1878
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,559
seattle greg and there's a few others we

1879
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,639
had been debating it because there was a

1880
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,880
lot of

1881
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,480
politics when we were

1882
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,039
talking about selling the seeds we were

1883
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,119
selling the seeds a lot of backs back

1884
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,200
talk and weird stuff going on behind the

1885
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,960
scenes so we really had a serious sit

1886
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,639
and think is it even worth it we're

1887
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,358
gonna do it we're gonna go ahead and do

1888
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:23,199
it

1889
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,519
so that's the announcement right now if

1890
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:28,078
anybody uh is interested we are gonna do

1891
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:30,159
that but it again just like the five

1892
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,680
just like the hawaiian lights we're

1893
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:33,279
going to do it proper we're going to

1894
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:34,960
take our time with it

1895
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,680
um anything that's worthwhile is going

1896
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,358
to take time and i should say on that

1897
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,078
level that one of the things i really

1898

01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,760
think northern lights took a while to

1956
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,640
get pushed like that because he doesn't

1957
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,799
like

1958
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,078
stuff typically associated with dutch

1959
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:41,759
stuff stuff that's going to smell like

1960
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,079
old dutch stuff and

1961
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,440
he's got his prejudices but he also lets

1962
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,720
the plants talk to him and he's willing

1963
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,798
to be surprised

1964
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,318
and i think now that he's used the la in

1965
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:52,480
a couple of things and he's gotten some

1966
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:53,440
really positive responses from lots of

1967
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,838
people

1968
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,599
it's made him more interested in seeing

1969
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:58,798
what else it can do

1970
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,680
yeah

1971
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:00,719
so

1972
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:02,960
um

1973
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,959
you know i don't think uh

1974
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,358
shanti baba would be one of the most

1975
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,920
unusual people to collab with he's not

1976
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:12,318
much of a collaborate with anyone like

1977
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,440
that i don't know if he's ever done a

1978
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:18,719
collab with anyone in america so

1979
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,920
that would be pretty far-fetched

1980
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:22,318
yeah

1981
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,039
that would be pretty far-fetched

1982
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:27,599
um you know so uh

1983
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:29,599
yeah but they um i mean so you know as

1984
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,039
always we try to keep it like

1985
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,559
light and we try to go in different

1986
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,280
directions you know uh on that aspect

1987
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,400
but

1988
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,798
um

1989
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,960
you know we'll see there's a lot of uh

1990
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:43,440
there's a lot of interest in old seeds

1991
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:46,400
right now and old lines and if a bunch

1992
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:49,200
of people could get 90 centsy work or 90

1993
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,079
serious work or this or that they would

1994
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,439
jump all over it and so

1995
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,440
you know um

1996
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:58,240
you know hopefully some of that stuff

1997
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,519
survived and hopefully amongst the wave

1998
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,318
of [ __ ]

1999
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:04,400
uh there's actually a few real gems

2000
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:06,639
that come to the surface as well

2001
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,519
you know i think a lot of people

2002
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:11,358
really really miss the [ __ ] out when uh

2003
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,199
pip swede offered silver pearl like

2004
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:16,960
people who are into old

2005
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:18,719
dank unique legit [ __ ] when pete tips

2006
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,079
we'd release that silver pearl we talked

2007
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:21,358
about it a lot because it was one of my

2008
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,640
favorite it still is one of my favorite

2009
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:25,119
things to smoke

2010
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:27,358
but there are times when people do drop

2011
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,798
these old gems that they've kept forever

2012
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,558
and people just for one reason or

2013
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,480
another miss out so make sure you guys

2014
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,880
are keeping your eyes peeled

2015
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,280
i think pip was just like two years too

2016
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,920
early i agree like if he was if he

2017
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,000
dropped it last year like in 2021 or

2018
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,920
something like that and he had some

2019
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,880
because the crazy thing about pip silver

2020
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,440
pearl

2021
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,519
um is that like you look at that you

2022
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,000
look at a picture of that weed and you

2023
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,838
hold it up to old silver pearl pictures

2024
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,119
and boy is it a ringer

2025
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:59,679
it's a dead asterisk man it really

2026
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,280
really looks like you know if not this i

2027
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:02,000
mean i'm not saying it's the same plant

2028
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,920
but

2029
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,519
you can really see like it's a very

2030
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,920
close resemblance

2031
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,358
and his death coast like for people if

2032
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,838
you would release death coast now if

2033
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:14,639
that clone made it around it would smoke

2034
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:16,640
every i in my opinion it would smoke

2035
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:18,639
most sours it would smoke most burnt

2036
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,679
rubber stuff i mean it was some of the

2037
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,239
loudest weed i'd ever ever entertained

2038
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,079
it's [ __ ] crazy i love that [ __ ] yeah

2039
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,678
i mean he's he's got you know the cool

2040
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:29,359
thing about him is he breeds what he

2041
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,399
loves and he's got some pretty cool

2042
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,719
lines

2043
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,519
and he also got a bit lucky

2044
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,679
yeah

2045
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,040
you know um a couple of times i mean

2046
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,480
he's gotten unlucky too you know he

2047
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:40,079
tried to he tried to reverse his

2048
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,959
sauerkraut and i think he got like 20

2049
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,000
seeds

2050
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,880
yeah yeah so that's exciting you know

2051
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,560
um

2052
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,319
and uh

2053
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,159
you know silver pearl to me this is kind

2054
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,560
of an unusual smell but like silver

2055
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:54,879
pearl to me smells like baby poo

2056
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,400
it smells like it smells like it smells

2057
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,400
like little kid poo and they're just

2058
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:00,318

it's pretty very it's pretty frosty and

2072
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,319
it doesn't yield that very big buds

2073
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,318
it's insanely resonance for its era

2074
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,159
that's insanely

2075
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,080
that's for sure and it's like

2076
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,920
um it's uh

2077
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:43,278

2081
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:52,559

c and made silver haze yeah

2083
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,600
um but yeah especially that death coast

2084
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,560
there's some things that pip did and he

2085
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,719
wasn't like a fanboy on ig and he didn't

2086
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,039
have this massive following but if

2087
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,560
people would have like bought him out

2088
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:07,760
the way they bought some more well-known

2089
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,880
breeders out they probably would have

2090
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,840
been happier

2091
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:14,480
all that money you spent on other people

2092
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,840
now hope you enjoy your animal mints uh

2093
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:19,279
did it remind you of the smell of

2094
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:21,920
shoreline no no it didn't to me

2095
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:23,920
uh shoreline like i said the indoor was

2096
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:27,039
very hot garbage the outdoor was very

2097
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,520
hot garbage and and legit urine

2098
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:32,238
somebody just asked what's early pearl

2099
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:34,000
my understanding of early pearl is early

2100
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:37,439
pearl is uh

2101
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,600
a worked early girl which is um

2102
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:42,479
something that

2103
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,400
which is pollyanna crossed with uh early

2104
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:47,119
pearl i believe is pollyanna which is a

2105
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:49,198
mexican cross with early girl correct

2106
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:51,279
and that's what it is and it's worked

2107
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:53,678
stuff from rob clark

2108
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:56,158
yes um the pollyanna came from rob clark

2109
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,880
the early the early girl huh

2110
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:58,879
so

2111
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,279
paulie came for rob clark there's

2112
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,679
there's speculation that

2113
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:06,800
the afghani and i think it's the afghani

2114
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:08,480
or the mexican and pollyanna might be

2115
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,079
the mexican skunk one that's the one

2116
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:11,759
thing we uh are trying to figure out

2117
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,559
yeah i mean there's there's some i mean

2118
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,880
i'm sure that uh sam and him know

2119
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,520
um you know but yeah he

2120
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,480
he was responsible for a number of early

2121
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,440
strains that went over to amsterdam i

2122
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:26,879
believe he brought over cali uh calio

2123
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,559
maybe

2124
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,279
california orange

2125
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,039
um and uh you know but there was a there

2126
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:34,000
was a handful of there was a handful of

2127
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,158
people

2128
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,399
um that were bringing things to holland

2129
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:40,799
and he was certainly one of them

2130
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:43,679
yeah so

2131
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,400
um but yeah and there's no doubt that

2132
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:49,920
um rob and sam in the in that we're

2133
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:51,839
working with mexicans and colombians

2134
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,800
trying to get colombians to finish in

2135
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,159
california yeah and so they were working

2136
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,520
with various and that makes sense

2137
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:59,039
because that's like the two most

2138
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,920
important things in that area at the

2139
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:00,880
time

2140
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,719
yeah

2141
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,079
go ahead someone's asking about dolores

2142
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,359
so i'm going to go grab a picture of

2143
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:06,880
dolores

2144
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,119
i don't know anything about i don't have

2145
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,960
it close it's in the other room

2146
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:12,158
it's in the other room and there's a guy

2147
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,039
there's actually a guy in here that i

2148
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:17,198
chat with buckshot hill who's his family

2149
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:20,000
was rocking a really nice early pearl

2150
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:22,399
cut in the in the early 90s

2151
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,880
and has been hunting uh through any kind

2152
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,559
of seed he can to try to see if he can

2153
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,760
find something that he remembers from

2154
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,159
that era

2155
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:34,079
we had a nice early early pearl cut in

2156
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:35,679
san diego too in the hog crew yeah so

2157
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:37,439
um so yeah you know some of that some of

2158
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,920
that early work some of the i don't you

2159
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:42,238
know is is really nice

2160
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,600
um and i wish it was still around for i

2161
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,279
mean there was an interesting thing i

2162
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,640
was talking to this gentleman from

2163
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:48,719
australia

2164
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,640
okay who worked with neville

2165
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,439
um some of the last years of neville's

2166
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,119
life

2167
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:55,039
yeah and he said one of neville's great

2168
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,039
regrets is that he couldn't take all the

2169
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,158
stuff he had in the 80s and 90s and work

2170
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,679
it now

2171
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:01,599
yeah

2172
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:04,560
with like you know 30 more years

2173
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,239
experience and a better sense of things

2174
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,640
and a better sense of the importance of

2175
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,879
things in certain aspects and he did a

2176
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,480
really good job back then

2177
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,000
yeah but i think a lot of breeders have

2178
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:15,759
that regret where it's like boy do i

2179
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,198
wish i had everything i had in the 90s

2180
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:21,199
and early 2000s now yeah

2181
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:22,719
you know um i have a lot more knowledge

2182
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:24,639
now

2183
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,480
smoked a lot more weed seen a lot more

2184
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,760
things talked a lot more

2185
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:28,799
so

2186
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,159
you know

2187
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,760
um

2188
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:35,839
and uh and yeah so

2189
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,280
uh that's that's early girl and you know

2190
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,880
i wish that we could get stuff from

2191
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,840
scentsy that was real

2192
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,480
um

2193
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,279
but um i i think those times passed

2194
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:46,559
sometime by the early to mid 2000s yeah

2195
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:48,399
i agree

2196
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,039
people asked how did they go downhill so

2197
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:53,279
fast so what happened to scentsy is that

2198
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:55,279
um they i think they were legit all

2199
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:57,198
throughout the 90s even after neville

2200
01:13:55,279 --> 01:13:59,359
left they still had most of their

2201
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:01,119
original moms and dads and they released

2202
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:04,158
some things that were like unreleased

2203
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:06,079
neville work in the later 90s anyway

2204
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:09,039
and then the laws changed they got

2205
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:12,238
busted i think they lost some things

2206
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:15,279
um and then they outsourced to spain

2207
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:17,519
that was the big death now so at that

2208
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:19,759
point who i i actually believe that

2209
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,760
there could be one or two things amongst

2210
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,199
you know the their collection that might

2211
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,960
still exist

2212
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:26,399
super silver haze yeah that's everywhere

2213
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,399
that's one of the ones that did get

2214
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:30,238
everywhere in in but you know but which

2215
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:33,198
ones are they and which ones are legit

2216
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,879
and which one's from who knows

2217
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:38,319
i think they've been untrustworthy for

2218
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,520
at least 15 15 plus years yeah

2219
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,279
sadly

2220
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,040
unfortunately yeah um but they had a

2221
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,119
good 10-year run

2222
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:48,079
you know from the early 90s to the early

2223
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,039
2000s they had a lot of legitimate stuff

2224
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,359
yeah

2225
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:53,439
so i would i would be very suspect of

2226
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:55,759
anything from scentsy today

2227
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:57,599
and the shame is that ben matt and i

2228
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,600
have talked a bunch about having ben and

2229
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,079
alan on

2230
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,239
because they were there and they know an

2231
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:06,319
enormous amount about the early history

2232
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:07,919
of dutch cannabis

2233
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:09,679
but they are

2234
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,679
very dutch businessmen and we've been

2235
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,440
told that they're terrible interviews

2236
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:15,520
yeah um and they still claim to this day

2237
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:17,519
they have all the original parents

2238
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,920
and scentsy is no different now than it

2239
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,560
was in the 90s

2240
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,679
and all that type of stuff so

2241
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,920
that's hard

2242
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,600
they promote scentsy

2243
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,000
yep you know they're not really

2244
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,679
interested in in history or being

2245
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,359
accurate or telling you what they lost

2246
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,480
or what they have or what they like so

2247
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:35,759
they have it in there they just don't

2248
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:37,519
give a [ __ ]

2249
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,600
uh keeper seeds we've done a whole

2250
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,679
episode or two on canadian seed banks

2251
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,440
we'll probably do some more um it just

2252
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,440
involves getting more of the canadian

2253
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:47,119
people involved because

2254
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:48,479
me and nazar have no place telling the

2255
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:50,479
history of

2256
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,238
canada's seed banks because they're not

2257
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,839
yeah we do have we have a we have a good

2258
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:55,119
friend we chat with all the time that's

2259
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,279
from up there that has a lot of

2260
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:00,559
connections and a lot of knowledge

2261
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:02,960
um you know uh matt talked to uh

2262
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:05,679
to um a couple of time

2263
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,920
yeah yeah talk to red and chimera you

2264
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,239
know um there's some other friends of

2265
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,920
theirs that might come on at some point

2266
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:16,000
um but uh yeah it's not really our scene

2267
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,000
yeah and and um

2268
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,399
shawnee is gonna be probably uh

2269
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,760
interviewing we had an interview with a

2270
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:23,279
dude named pete from up there that was

2271
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,600
also part of their scene

2272
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:27,119
but sadly we don't have the audio

2273
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,640
anymore someone else has it and we can't

2274
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,960
get it back so we're probably going to

2275
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,400
do another interview again and just try

2276
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,760
to hit it from scratch johnny's going to

2277
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:35,519
help a lot with that because shaunie's

2278
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,520
our canadian connect

2279
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,640
someone just asked what about the dudes

2280
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,400
that are revamping the sssc

2281
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,679
uh well we had a big interview with

2282
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:46,000
corel

2283
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,719
um so the guy that used to own

2284
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,719
the company is still alive and still a

2285
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:53,600
part of it and i believe you know he's

2286
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,198
in his 70s now probably so it's i would

2287
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,280
imagine his son and some other people

2288
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:59,039
are doing a ton um

2289
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,479
you know and it doesn't seem it

2290
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:02,479
certainly doesn't seem like they have a

2291
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,639
ton of their original stuff

2292
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:07,039
so they're trying to revamp things but

2293
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:09,679
it does seem like they have a few at

2294
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:10,640
least one but possibly a few very old

2295
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,319
cuttings

2296
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,960
yeah um that they're using sort of as

2297
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,039
the baseline to get restarted again from

2298
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,800
their work in the 80s

2299
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:20,319
yeah you know

2300
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,119
that was a great interview too i

2301
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:23,119
remember

2302
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:25,198
after that was done we were just so

2303
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:26,800
stoked like because it was special like

2304
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:29,519
nobody had really done a great interview

2305
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:31,760
with sssc in many years many many years

2306
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,360
so well if you haven't heard that stuff

2307
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,800
go check it out the other thing that i

2308
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,238
liked a bunch too was that obviously

2309
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,360
they talked about how they didn't have

2310
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:39,519
any um

2311
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:40,880
he was very upfront about quite there he

2312
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,199
was very upfront about most of it there

2313
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,039
was a few things where time or whatever

2314
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:47,039
he didn't want to speak to it

2315
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:48,800
um you know but he did give some really

2316
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:50,719
cool tidbits that we didn't know before

2317
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,600
and he added depth and he was certainly

2318
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,319
there

2319
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,679
um so all that stuff was very cool i

2320
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:58,158
think that interview probably had the

2321
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,679
most bombshells in it that we've done of

2322
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:02,238
things we didn't know

2323
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:04,800
that were unknown to most of the public

2324
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:06,799
so i think it's really cool yeah so he's

2325
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,719
so he's part he's part of the of the

2326
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,320
revamp they're certainly not going to be

2327
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,640
able to like just release their old

2328
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:15,039
catalog like it was in the 80s

2329
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,360
um but they do have some old things and

2330
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,719
they're mixing them with other stuff and

2331
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,198
you know when i interviewed him he

2332
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:23,600
seemed like an older version of us

2333
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:26,879
yeah he seemed like a cool cat you know

2334
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:29,679
so yeah he was cool i'm into it

2335
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,880
yeah i'm into him he was a nice man

2336
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:34,560
all right anything else you want to

2351
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:03,359
always there's a bunch of stuff that the

2352
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,600
questions and things that i see i try to

2353
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:07,119
pick out some out of the comments if we

2354
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,640
didn't answer them it's not because it

2355
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:10,880
wasn't a good one it just didn't go with

2356
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:13,119
the flow of what we were chatting about

2357
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,880
you know so don't um so you can always

2358
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:16,000
ask us on the discord or you can always

2359
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,560
dm

2360
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,960
you know uh or anything like that

2361
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:23,280
and so um

2362
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,760
you know keeper topics keeper topics are

2363
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:28,399
hard because it's personal preference

2364
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,480
um what i what i consider a keeper you

2365
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,879
might not consider a keeper

2366
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:35,439
we might have different criteria um the

2367
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,319
biggest criteria that i would say for a

2368
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:41,359
keeper for you is do you enjoy the the

2369
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:44,079
flavor of the high and the way it burns

2370
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:46,639
yeah those are like you know do you like

2371
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:48,880
if you personally like it a whole bunch

2372
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,440
um then it could be a keeper

2373
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,119
you know if if i don't like the flavor

2374
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:54,960
of something even if i like the high

2375
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:56,800
it's not very likely that i'll keep

2376
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,480
smoking it for myself but some people

2377
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:01,279
may prefer the high over the flavor so

2378
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:04,238
that's why it's very i mean

2379
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:06,479
obviously it's it's the easier to a

2380
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:08,319
keeper becomes easier when when she

2381
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:10,959
checks all the boxes

2382
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,158
yeah you know i mean grandpa used to say

2383
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,880
there's nothing wrong with rich and

2384
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:17,119
beautiful you know uh

2385
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:20,880
but um you know so obviously if you have

2386
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:23,119
phenomenal high and incredible flavor uh

2387
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,600
that's great but you know there's plants

2388
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,399
i keep that don't have a very potent

2389
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,400
high

2390
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:29,359
but have other aspects that i like quite

2391
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:31,439
a bit

2392
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:33,279
um and there's there's the reverse too i

2393
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:34,079
mean i've talked a bunch about that that

2394
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:35,359
uh

2395
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,920
um

2396
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:40,559
that peacemaker that you know the uh the

2397
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,480
great white shark cut that i had that

2398
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,360
was almost hallucinogenic it was so

2399
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:45,439
strong

2400
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,119
but it tasted like smoke

2401
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:49,519
i couldn't find a good one that had any

2402
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:49,519
flavor

2403
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,719
so

2404
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,960
