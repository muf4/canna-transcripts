answers and a lot of stuff I'd like to

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,759
dig out of you so first and foremost we

37
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,239
usually dive into the easy stuff which

38
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,879
is what was your early intro to weed as

39
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:36,239
far as just smoking your first intro to

40
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:41,239
seeing this plant that is

41
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,879
cannabis well I grew up with uh I grew

42
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,438
up around

43
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,599
uh

44
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:51,319
uh early charismatic Christians and 1%

45
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:55,759
bikers my old man had a excavating

46
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:58,798
company and he had a lot of uh

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,079
uh bikers who were in a club called the

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,880
pagans and and

49
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:09,799
um so I I one of my favorite most

50
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:14,878
awesome smells I ever smelled was herb

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:18,200
burning in my old man's office and uh

52
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:21,679
just the best smell ever and

53
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:24,598
probably first smoked it

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,519
13ish yeah sounds about

55
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,919
right at probably a church

56
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,680
camp yeah so were your parents the

57
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:37,399
charismatic Christians my mom was but my

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,519
dad was uh was a a cokehead yeah or a

59
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,439
raving Coke attic more than cokehead

60
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,719
charismatic

61
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,719
cokehead Evangelical cokehead yeah I had

62
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,560
one of those

63
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,479
too so what kind of weed was around when

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,719
you first started smoking like uh what

65
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:58,439
what what era are we looking

66
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:03,000
at well when I was 16 and that's when I

67
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:05,239
became enthusiastic IC yeah um you know

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,360
you get out from under your parents Wing

69
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:11,158
it's easy you got your car you can go

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,400
get some herb and so all I wouldn't say

71
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:17,639
that everything that you would have seen

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,280
in the uh the old High Times trans High

73
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,399
Market

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,439
quotation there was a variety of

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,879
imports

76
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,158
um if you were a little bit older than

77
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,919
me you would be much more Savvy you know

78
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:35,199
I was you know 16 and getting whatever

79
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,598
it was that the older guys were selling

80
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:41,438
but you had everything from Jamaican to

81
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:41,438
Colombian

82
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:50,318
to I think the first QP I bought was uh

83
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,000
aapo gold and it was down on the DC line

84
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:56,598
because I grew up in in the DC suburbs

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,199
of Maryland yeah and

86
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:02,839
uh the DC line area was a Trad TR

87
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:06,919
illegal sales area and where we could

88
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:11,480
always buy underage booze or or what

89
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:14,559
have you and and that was real

90
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:18,798
golden yeah pot

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,199
um there was some thae weed um never saw

92
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,198
any Thai

93
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,639
stick and then it just became pretty

94
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,759
much Mexi and

95
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,639
then became Mexi and kbud so there was

96
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
there was two kinds of pot it was you

97
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,759
know commercial and most of the

98
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:40,799
commercial that was getting to me in the

99
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,400
DC area which I sold you know brick weed

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,199
and grew my own

101
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,959
pot

102
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:52,199
uh that stuff was ironically coming via

103
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:55,560
Colorado Springs and and boulder oh wow

104
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,840
so colle kid Network were you were you

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,280
just uh popping seeds that you had from

106
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,799
your stash when you were first started

107
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,319
growing

108
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,400
I first popped seeds when I

109
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:13,279
was 17 right before I went into Army

110
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:14,839
Reserves on a bet oh no and yeah and uh

111
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,439
the seeds weren't there when I got or

112
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,478
the plants weren't there when I came

113
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:24,478
back did they get harvested did they

114
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:24,478
get no idea it wasn't wasn't

115
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,400
me but clones you know it back then when

116
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,918
I started to grow I I think it would

117
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:37,159
have been uh the thing that I have in my

118
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:41,719
in my mind as a Tim stamp of that era of

119
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:46,840
beginning was uh it was

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:51,319
uh The Grateful Dead version of uh the

121
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:54,198
the the Warlock shows in h Hampton and

122
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm not a big dead show but that's like

123
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,520
okay this is when I started growing so

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,399
this is about

125
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,799
89 and clones were were they were really

126
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,679
hard to get and seeds were really hard

127
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:11,038
to get and I knew some people in

128
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:14,038
Virginia and they grew like Mass Super

129
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,038
Skunk

130
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:22,879
um probably the first

131
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:24,959
real seeds that I popped that were not

132
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,959
you know throw away Mexi seeds would

133
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:31,879
have been a a hash Haze cross and

134
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:35,038
ironically again those seeds Had An

135
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:38,800
Origin they were made in Eagle Colorado

136
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,839
and this old grower that I knew went on

137
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
a road trip and he brought these seeds

138
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:44,000
back and we had a [ __ ] ton of them we

139
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,000
grew that

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
pot a lot

141
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:55,478
and it's still what I

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,720
consider kind bud it it's still that

143
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:01,120
that

144
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,360
imprinted profile knows

145
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,759
that I don't know it's like good ganja

146
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,720
when it wasn't good

147
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,160
ganja when there wasn't a lot of good

148
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,720
yeah was it long flowering since it was

149
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,240
a haze

150
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,080
hybrid no we didn't flower [ __ ] long

151
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
yeah didn't have a chance to flower it

152
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,959
[ __ ] long right

153
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,000
no no that is definitely learned along

154
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:33,239
the way yeah but uh you know it was it

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,279
was it was was typical it wasn't uh it

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,319
wasn't some long flowering thing so this

157
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,198
is all while you're in DC and Maryland

158
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,639
it kind of just like it it's weird to me

159
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,879
because I think about DC and like the

160
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,079
risks involved with that being some kind

161
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,759
of extra Federal

162
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:55,639
territory well you know

163
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,598
Ironically in the early 90s I believe it

164
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,960
would have been uh during uh the Clinton

165
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:05,038
Administration that someone in DC in

166
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,560
Dupont Circle MH called at the White

167
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,719
House and

168
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,680
threatened the president and he had

169
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,280
plants growing and he was tripping balls

170
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,560
and I believe that that was the

171
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,359
first cultivation arrest in Washington

172
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,240
DC but but Maryland was scary and

173
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,520
Virginia was really scary at the gross

174
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,439
store that we went to was called Home

175
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,560
Harvest and he was

176
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,479
uh you know from the pranker School

177
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,158
prankster school of thought the

178
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,000
yippy

179
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:44,080
um uh

180
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,720
early normal organizer and he always put

181
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,800
his grow stores right next to the bong

182
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,720
and dildo stores so that's

183
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,159
awesome yeah I mean it was a great

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,399
strategy it worked for him for a long

185
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,799
time all in one go get your bongs go get

186
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,759
your dildos you're set yeah and that

187
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,719
that that store was called Home Harvest

188
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:05,799
and guy's name was Jeff Edwards and he's

189
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:11,360
dead now but uh he's a real inspiration

190
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:13,919
to my business Harvest House and uh

191
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,039
really really good guy really incredible

192
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:20,159
resource to have you know you've got to

193
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,719
remember that this is the

194
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:27,039
uh you know just post operation green

195
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,959
Merchant era and everybody was scared

00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,519
shitless because they were

197
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,599
very free and ordering everything online

198
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,759
with credit cards and all of a sudden

199
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,519
you know

200
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:42,919
everything uh it came to an end

201
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,679
and you know you went from being

202
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:48,278
carefree and Casual to people walking

203
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:52,319
quarter mile down the road to the grow

204
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:55,000

I was on Canadian territory so they had

Tofino well during this period of time

377
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,400
the the Hell's Angels I believe and

378
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:53,720
other biker groups were kind of at War

379
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,720
and and

380
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,919
uh intimidating Growers and making deals

381
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:04,679
and there was a long and short of it

382
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:07,000
there is a um a pot industry related

383
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,759
murder that occurred in

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,839
Tofino on the night that I stayed in

385
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:15,640
that shitty hotel and had the receipt so

386
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,759
until I presented that receipt they were

387
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,440
concerned about me being involved with

388
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:23,798
that

389
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:27,120
murder so it was just a totally crazy

390
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:30,879
weird thing and

391
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:33,678
uh I made it home and they to my house

392
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,600
how deep was the strip search you know

393
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,919
bent over I didn't stick anything up my

394
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:41,079
ass but

395
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:45,120
uh that's what we all wanted to know

396
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:48,240
no it was it was just uh you know just

397
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,558
uh external yeah just a little Peep Peep

398
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,359
Show little fortunately it wasn't the

399
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:57,158
Americans yeah right yeah they go deep

400
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,199
they go deep with it yeah okay so yeah

401
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,440
that th those were uh

402
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,759
great seeds but you know in hindsight

403
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm pretty sure they the Dutch stuff

404
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,319
wasn't Reon you know the gu's a

405
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,120
scoundrel so did the seeds did you

406
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,279
actually ever end up getting the seeds

407
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,839
that you had sent or was oh yeah yeah I

408
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,119
grew them for years yeah I grew all

409
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,599
sorts of stuff do you remember what what

410
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,558
kind of strange you were trying to grab

411
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:24,199
at the time specifically any of them

412
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:28,480
well you know it was you know ciny was

413
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,640
the dominant yeah thing back then and I

414
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,120
I think that

415
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,280
uh I think for the most part the except

416
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:38,959
for maybe Maple Leaf

417
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:42,200
indicia I think out of all that was the

418
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,038
only thing from ciny that ended up like

419
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,200
sticking around for a

420
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:50,879
while um I grew

421
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,480
uh oh no no no no I'm thinking of a

422
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,400
different a different different seed

423
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,360
buying that was the Amsterdam gotta trip

424
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,360
so in the early days there was a guy

425
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,359
named

426
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:09,599
uh Mike Parks who had a company called

427
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:14,600
weed seed okay and weed seed was a

428
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:16,759
British company that went to Holland and

429
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:23,278
bought seeds and mailed them from

430
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:25,720
England yeah in uh fake uh Lady D

431
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:29,200
memorabilia and

432
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:36,079
uh I went over there

433
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:38,840
with him and met uh like Simon and

434
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:41,359
uh oh Saga

435
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:45,000
Martha I'm having a brain cramp on his

436
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:47,240
name Tony yeah Tony uh I actually met

437
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
him when he was in on the

438
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,558
side

439
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,759
uh but you know

440
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:56,119
the when I got to Colorado I was burning

441
00:21:54,759 --> 00:22:00,119
through those

442
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,119
seeds um

443
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,480
and a lot

444
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:08,839
of the

445
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,000
typical stuff that you would hear about

446
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:14,599
in Fort HS my computer is doing some

447
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
weird [ __ ] let me quit something all

448
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,719
right yeah the Colorado strains the

449
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,278
burning through the

450
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,480
seeds well you know I was hooked up with

451
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:27,480
the 77 guys so I was growing whatever

452
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,038
they were growing let's talk about that

453
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,120
because you know um

454
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,679
I think some of us that were from the

455
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,519
for ARA some of us got a good idea of

456
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,200
the 77 crew but even for me it's kind of

457
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,960
like just this mythical group of guys

458
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,000
that were doing what I wanted to do but

459
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,720
I was doing it decades later so I'd love

460
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,240
to hear some about the 77 crew how did

461
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,319
it get started what was it and what was

462
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,079
the goal behind

463
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:56,678
it

464
00:22:54,079 --> 00:23:00,558
well so

465
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:03,759
the there wasn't a whole lot of Internet

466
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,918
Resources obviously at that point so

467
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,879
hemp

468
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,960
BC

469
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:15,600
um had an HTML website that

470
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,480
was completely basic and I was not

471
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:22,000
computer savvy at all during that period

472
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,880
of time but all of a sudden you could

473
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,159
make usernames and you could make these

474
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:33,278
little back rooms yeah and you know like

475
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:36,360
how I got my name was

476
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:40,319
uh I had just traveled around California

477
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:43,678
I was totally in the Mir woods and uh

478
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:49,879
you know and all that [ __ ] so I

479
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:55,159
was in a flame war with uh AB hybrid

480
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:58,640
yeah and uh Ron who you know

481
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:02,080
npga suggested that I change my handle

482
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,480
um after this vicious back and forth

483
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:07,759
with

484
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,200
uh [ __ ] H and uh because he went by

485
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:14,319
Illuminator back then and he used the

486
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,640
big 1500 watt Stadium bulb oh did he oh

487
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:21,158
yeah he was totally easy to [ __ ] with

488
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,080
Yeah by Illuminator and uh Hy did went

489
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:28,200
by Illuminator yeah yeah that's funny so

490
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:31,038
when he found out my name was mure yeah

491
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,200
he he's like you put an exclamation

492
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,319
point on the end of it and I and I kept

493
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,640
it ever

494
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:43,398
since but the you know so the 77 was

495
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:47,840
this guy Eric 77 and he was the guy that

496
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:49,959
passed around the the very orange Calo

497
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:55,158
yep

498
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,640
ae77 got and uh he worked out of a shop

499
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,720
didn't he what what was his shop he

500
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,640
worked out of

501
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,519
he Berkeley patience group maybe or

502
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,840
lived in Florida he lived in Florida

503
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:11,599
yeah okay yeah um yeah totally not

504
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,639
California he might have ended up I

505
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:17,119
don't he might have ended up with Ron in

506
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,240
California at some point but gotcha not

507
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,759
at that point I don't think I don't

508
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:27,000
think so I think he died down south

509
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:29,038
gotcha so the 77 was a back room that

510
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,240
was organized by

511
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:35,359
by Eric and it became the

512
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:40,319
77

513
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,319
um Vic High had

514
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,360
um a back room I can't remember what it

515
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,119
was called but a lot of the these people

516
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:52,079
had their little things and you would

517
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:55,079
set up things and burn them and uh and

518
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:59,519
then a group of us you know kind of

519
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:04,278
congealed in in the 77 and

520
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:09,079
and I think we all moved from

521
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:11,240
uh hemp BC there was a early website

522
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:13,519
called Laughing Moon I'm sure you're

523
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,599
familiar with laughing mooning Moon yep

524
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,839
and they were famous for having some

525
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:21,839
insanely priced Kong clone yep I

526
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,079
remember the Kong yeah

527
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:28,678
yeah so I think that that's the first

528
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:34,000
place I remember strain base maybe being

529
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,759
okay and we had ended up with a back

530
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,558
room

531
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:42,319
on that website The Laughing Moon

532
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:45,000
website that became known as the

533
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:50,439
77 okay so that was like the established

534
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,440
77 base at that point yeah

535
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,200
and you know and and from those guys you

536
00:26:54,119 --> 00:27:00,639
know came the

537
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,440
the uh overgrow and in in cannabis world

538
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,720
yeah so and they had you know you know

539
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:11,000
Ron was the first person that I went to

540
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,798
and met in California and I I became

541
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,359
close with California people because

542
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,960
there was a

543
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:20,879
perceived safety with people who are

544
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,558
operating under the California medical

545
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,000
yeah rules so definitely a perceived

546
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,678
safety for sure yeah yeah

547
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,798
so uh

548
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,559
so was the 77 crew was it was it

549
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,359
essentially a way to move clones Across

550
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:37,158
the Nation to trade or is it just dudes

551

on what other channels they're on when

565
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,759

566
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,880
those guys a little a little odd but a

567
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,200
little sus um you know it's really wild

568
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,480
to to

569
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,000
see you know really well-known names who

570
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,599
you know started out not knowing [ __ ]

571
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,759
and and you know just this weird little

572
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,199
dorks

573
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:41,319
on cannabis websites

574
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:44,278
right bet yeah so but you know the the

575
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,720
77 you know there was a a time where

576
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,759
those guys really took that [ __ ]

577
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:52,839
seriously and wouldn't you know even

578
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:56,319
type out the 77 it put asterisks in it

579
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:59,398
or oh my goodness yeah so you know

580
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,720
secret agent [ __ ] yeah took it super

581
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:07,239
serious but you know through the years I

582
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:11,679
traveled to meet a lot of the folks that

583
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,640
I could conveniently and even some that

584
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,000
weren't convenient

585
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,640
and there's always been a extreme

586
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,480
willingness to

587
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:28,880
share yeah I there's no way that

588
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,880
the 77 was set up to to share clones but

589
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,399
we shared the [ __ ] out of clones yeah

590
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,000
you know this was at the point where

591
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:40,000
most of us couldn't even post an image

592
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,519
online yeah right

593
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,558
so

594
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,519
uh so what else can I tell you let's see

595
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,359
77 crew we got that tell us some of the

596
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,440
notable characters I mean right around

597
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,278
the time that U Canon world and overgrow

598
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,798
started what what were some of the guys

599
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:59,759
that that left good Impressions on you

600
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:01,639
or negative impressions on you for that

601
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,640
matter you know because that's always

602
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,440
interesting negative ones are easy um

603
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,600
yeah you know subcool is the first

604
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,320
negative one that comes my mind same

605
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,359
here it's weird how that works I was

606
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:18,759
like boom okay yeah well we could start

607
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:20,359
with him yeah you know he he his he

608
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,200
tried to get me to come to Georgia and

609
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:26,839
grow pot with him and you

610
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,038
know uh and then it just became series

611
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:31,158
of disasters after disaster for that guy

612
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:35,640
yeah

613
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:39,559
um so he was probably

614
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,559
uh the most

615
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:49,519
uh the most negatively notable you know

616
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:54,319
I think um people like Ron uh

617
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:59,839
NCGA is really uh you know with his uh

618
00:30:54,319 --> 00:31:03,839
his events and the stuff that he did to

619
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:08,599
support other people in their Endeavors

620
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:11,638
and uh you know I I think Ron used to

621
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:14,638
have uh what you call I I think chip and

622
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:16,759
I would call it the the the old the old

623
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:20,199
guy rescue program I can't remember

624
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:22,359
exactly how we we would we called it but

625
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,440
he would uh you know he would take these

626
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,278
guys

627
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,200
from um other parts of the country and

628
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:33,519
help them get a foothold in yeah in his

629
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,240
area and it was uh it was cool to watch

630
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,159
him do his

631
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,159
thing you know

632
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,240

633
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:48,398
way same way yeah I mean amazing guy

634

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,519
yeah but uh did he get your sour from

661
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,319
you

662
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:21,679
too I don't know if he got the sour from

663
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:26,480
me or not I sent

664
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,440
um uh a grip of those West with uh Ron

665
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,200
one year on his

666
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,000
yearly trip gotcha that makes sense then

667
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,960
yeah and that would have been around

668
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,480
uh

669
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,360
99

670
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,880
2000ish where did you uh because because

671
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:45,839
a lot of people don't know like CSI he

672
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,960
attributes his sour coming around via

673
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:52,199
you so where did you uh acquire the sour

674
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,558
at how did you run into it early on so I

675
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,679
had this dude who was my running partner

676
00:33:54,558 --> 00:34:01,359
at the

677
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:04,480
time um he he was uh half Pakistani and

678
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:09,358
uh half white kid from New Jersey no

679
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:13,519
from uh the bronks yeah and he knew a

680
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:16,319
bunch of dead heads in Crested but who

681
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:19,639
had this cutting called Sour Diesel and

682
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,559
it was getting stupid money like

683
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,720
like like crazy I mean regular pot was

684
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,918
4,800 bucks you know yeah so this was

685
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,959
you I I I can't even quote what it was

686
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,358
but it was it was at that time I like

687
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,000
holy [ __ ] and everybody's like it's

688
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:36,319
different it's different it's different

689
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,960
and I'm like ah there's nothing

690
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,280
different and right

691
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,800
yeah and so I got my cutting from these

692
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:49,720
guys that my buddy knew from dead

693
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,560
tour and they took all their herb back

694
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:55,039
to New York to sell it from

695
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:58,960
crute

696
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:01,679
um so that's where my my cutting came

697
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,880
from and it's it's still there but I I

698
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:08,559
think it's there's it's like a shadow of

699
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,599
itself I I I wouldn't ever [ __ ] with it

700
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:15,358
but it's still grown in in the valley

701
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,519
but it's it's all dead tour related yeah

702
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:21,279
that makes sense that's all

703
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:23,400
um you know that's that's where it

704
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,760
that's how it got around so you

705
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,240
mentioned you weren't like much of a

706
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,079
dead guy what kind of stuff are you into

707
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,719
I mean I like I like the dad I like the

708
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,800
dad I like to say that I came for the

709
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:34,799
drugs and stayed for the

710
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,079
music you know I grew I grew up in a

711
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:43,079
crazy Christian church and was ejected

712
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:48,640
from that at 16 and and landed in the DC

713
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:51,280
Punk scene yeah and uh that was uh mid

714
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:55,078
80s epicenter man D

715
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Discord yeah um government

716
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,880
issue I never saw a Minor Threat but

717
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,960
uh you know all of those Discord bands

718
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:08,318
and uh most incredible show I ever saw

719
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:12,280
was Butthole Surfers open for uh the

720
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:14,960
dead kennedies that's W and

721
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,640
uh man I never seen anything like that

722
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,159
in my life still to this day it's bet

723
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:23,279
it's in the top three four shows that

724
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:26,000
I've seen impacting like Kenedy

725
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,079
shouldn't have even come on stage really

726
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,960
but Hol servers did that good oh my God

727
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:36,480
I I I was yeah I was high as [ __ ] on a

728
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:40,199
bunch of pagan crank and it was one of

729
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,760
the most insane experiences ever you

730
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:45,078
know because we had listened to these

731
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,200
albums sure and you know there's a

732
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:51,560
[ __ ] tuba on those albums those early

733
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:53,759
BS yeah and it's like holy [ __ ] you know

734
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,880
there's a big white tube on stage and it

735
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,319
was that you know I've seen a lot of

736
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,358
Almond Brothers and Grateful Dead two

737
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:03,239
drum bands but yeah you know but hole

738
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,559
servers was the first band I ever saw

739
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:09,358
with two drummers so yeah that's wild

740
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:12,279
was great and you know growing up in uh

741
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:14,598
in the DC area was awesome it was a

742
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,200
small City it was approachable it was

743
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,760
relatively safe and uh it's great music

744
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:25,118
yeah dude that's a killer time to grow

745
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:28,119
up in DC I I kind of turn I I became a

746
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,720
real into pot and when I got really into

747
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:34,318
the pot I really wanted to to grow it

748
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:36,639
and sell it and that's how I ended up

749
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:40,358
going to see a lot of dead shows and I

750
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:43,480
have a lot of Grateful Dead head friends

751
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:45,719
but you know I'm I'm a lot more into

752
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,559
like early Jerry projects

753
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:52,159
versus like the

754
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:55,199
warlocks no like uh like Legion of Mary

755
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:58,519
and I'm not familiar that stuff with

756
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:02,799
Merl Saunders and

757
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:07,119
uh yeah not not dead Jerry stuff yeah

758
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,680
yeah uh but that's all fascinating to me

759
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,079
I mean the warlocks are kind of like a

760
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,039
they were one of those they're often

761
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:15,039
considered Proto punk in in many ways so

762
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,679
that's one of the bands that always

763
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,880
interests me there's a a record out with

764
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,159
the falling spikes which were Velvet

765
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,838
Underground before they were velvet

766
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:26,679
underground and on the B side is H the

767
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:29,440
warlocks that's out there somewhere it's

768
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,440
pretty cool

769
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:35,519
yeah music nerd history there you

774
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:54,400
it [ __ ] I know um reach reach was

775
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,000
probably in that if I remember

776
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,318
correctly yeah not me no one I really

777
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,920
jive with okay uh Colorado famous lines

778
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:07,719
and cuts here we go let's hear some uh

779
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,159
we have the peab bud and I I've talked

780
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,199
to you briefly about this before what do

781
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:15,480
you know about the peab bud

782
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:18,559
uh the peab bud was grown in a town

783
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:23,240
called ponia yeah

784
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:25,679
um it's a name that is kind of a generic

785
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:29,039
name

786
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:32,199
um the what people typically talk about

787
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,639
as peab but I believe would be called

788
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:40,719
um ponia

789
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:42,639
purple paralyzer yeah yeah

790
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:46,799
um

791
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:49,480
and that guy uh that I sent you the

792
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,880
seeds of

793
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:57,000
yeah the story that he tells me was that

794
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,519
uh you know Boulder was in the early 70s

795
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,800
was a pretty significant hippie

796
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:07,039
community and it was a an

797
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,560
earlier place of uh for marijuana trade

798
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:13,159
and sales I I mean I was surprised in

799
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,759
hearing the stories from this guy that

800
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:19,118
there wasn't ganja everywhere but it it

801
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,760
was a a developing Market at this point

802
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,280
gotcha

803
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:28,960
um so supposedly some hippies left

804
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,319
Boulder and moved to pay

805
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,480
and that's where the pay the peab bud

806
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:40,000
comes from same line as as what you have

807
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,599
just just separated 20 some years

808
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,079
ago

809
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,599
um but

810
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,000
that that purple herb was also grown in

811
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,480
towns like Garder which was in the Wet

812
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,880
Mountain Valley where you

813
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,519
have you know uh you know leave us alone

814
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,760
kind of hippie type sure

815
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:03,800
communities that don't really exist

816
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:08,000
anymore um not not the way that they did

817
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:11,680
then but you know that's

818
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,559
uh you know that's the only

819
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,559
really what I would consider like

820
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,719
uh heirloom kind

821
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:31,079
of hot spot yeah be ponia and maybe

822
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:32,719
Garder um but these PE you know you know

823
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,119
places like

824
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:39,519
Leadville it's over 10,000 feet um you

825
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:43,039
know so a lot of these places where

826
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:46,000
everybody went to live in the mountains

827
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:49,480
and smoke ganja and grow ganja it's

828
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,599
really really hard to grow outside yeah

829
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,400
because you can have

830
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,960
um you know four inches of hail in

831
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,440
August oh I bet and it's just you don't

832
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,039
have anything and it sticks out you know

833
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,920
it's like dirt and rocks and and pine

834
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:09,400
trees around here it's not it's not an

835
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,800
easy easy place to grow outdoors but

836
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:16,039
ponia is a farming area yeah and you

837
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,160
know I'm sure it it's still there and

838
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:22,239
I'm sure there's still people just in

839
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:26,358
the same way that you've

840
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:29,039
got hippies on the mountain in NorCal

841
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:33,558
that you know are still doing stuff

842
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:36,519
that's their own stuff yeah and not what

843
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:39,200
everybody else is doing so I think it's

844
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:41,519
here I I've often thought of trying to

845
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:45,118
do what you do for

846
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:48,039
Colorado and try to get out there and

847
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,000
capture some of the stories because you

848
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:53,759
know California is is the mothership in

849
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,440
in my opinion

850
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,319
um and Colorado is is a

851
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,200
long a

852
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:06,000
longstanding ganja state but absolutely

853
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:09,598
it's more of

854
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,838
a I mean long before Denver became the

855
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:17,160
center of ganja in Colorado it was you

856
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:21,759
it was Netherland it was Leadville it

857
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:24,399
was uh Durango it it was not Denver it

858
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,480
was everywhere but Denver that's not

859
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,639
where you know until

860
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,679
people started blowing

861
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:35,480
up shitty

862
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:37,838
warehouses that that was that was G

863
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:41,039
ganja was Denver is not a ganja town

864
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:43,880
that was like 2016 it became the the

865
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:46,199
ganja Center would you say around the

866
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:50,318
time of the the legalization the first

867
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:53,519
Cannabis Cup type [ __ ] well you know all

868
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:55,400
these early Gardens were you know Denver

869
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,480
was full of empty warehouses that were

870
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,400
sitting and not doing anything so there

871
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,000
was lots of cheap real estate that you

872
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,680
could get into nobody had any experience

873
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,559
I

874
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:11,318
actually uh ended up in one of these

875
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,640
early

876
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:18,558
uh warehouses you know

877
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:21,358
nobody had designed HVAC systems for it

878
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,559
yet yeah nobody could grow pot without

879
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:27,639
powdering mildew in those environments

880
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,519
and the herb was so horrible that

881
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:33,358
it it's responsible for the concentrate

882
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:35,920
bone yeah yeah for sure you had all of

883
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:38,880
this herb that was so powdery Milo

884
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,920
ridden that nobody could do [ __ ] with it

885
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,079
you couldn't uh blast it there'd be

886
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,519
dumpsters full of

887
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,480
[ __ ] butane cans people smoking a

888
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:54,000
cigarette in within sight of my store

889
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:57,119
here there is a house blow up within

890
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,400
sight that way there was a house blow up

891
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:05,039
J um three houses in the town of

892
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,519
Netherland during that open blasting era

893
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,759
you know

894
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,639
so you know you can [ __ ] about

895
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,920
regulations but that's one thing for

896
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:16,159
sure that I'm glad we got past people

897
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,838
get pissed when you say that too like

898
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,039
that the extract artist whole idea came

899
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,078
because a bunch of people tried going

900
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:26,318
weed and were really shitty at it and

901
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,880
had to try to move it somehow which

902
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,639
became the B boom I mean that to me

903
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,559
that's it was just so evident watching

904
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:37,440
it but people don't like hearing that

905
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:40,240
well I remember and and even the the the

906
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,720
the gross ass way that that [ __ ] was

907
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:48,239
smoked on those like titanium Skillets

908
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:51,598
and yeah yeah oh man fiery red the first

909
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:53,959
ear wax you get some dude he'd come you

910
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:58,359
get whatever it was that you were going

911
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:01,599
to have in blast and and uh

912
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:04,598
this [ __ ] sold for a $100 a gram and it

913
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,599
was like

914
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:09,959
gelatinous it looked like [ __ ] ear

915
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,000
wax yeah

916
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:16,199
um yeah

917
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,719
yeah those days all because nobody could

918
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:20,598
grow pot to begin with yeah and they

919
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,318
still needed to move it to they still

920
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:26,318
needed to make a return

921
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:28,920
therefore and this is how you smoke it

922
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:28,920
yeah

923
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,318
let me tell you that

924
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:40,480
too and you know it is really crazy I

925
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:43,440

931
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:00,838
really amazing but

932

pocketbook too bad yeah that's not too

945
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:45,838

946
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,240
the that canono hyperemesis Syndrome

947
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,440
from dabbing and I don't know if you're

familiar with that but it [ __ ] you up

949
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,200
super bad so I learned my lesson not to

950
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:58,598
you know dab every 10 minutes it kind of

951
00:47:56,199 --> 00:48:00,799
turned me off to extracts permanently

952
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,599
but I had to go through my own see that

953
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,039
yeah yeah I had to go through my own uh

954
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,039
round of buying my own cannabis because

955
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:09,639
I you know knocked down the grows and

956
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:12,519
[ __ ] because I was throwing up too much

957
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:15,558
couldn't run anything H yeah it's a

958
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:18,559
[ __ ] it's a [ __ ] I'll tell

959
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:21,760
you yeah i' I've had friends that have

960
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:25,440
been unable to smoke and be Growers

961
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,800
and uh one of them just is able to smoke

962
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,480
again now so it's

963
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,680
it's hard yeah i' i' I've gone the 11

964
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,559
months now that that I was told I need

965
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:39,639
to go fully without smoking once you

966
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:42,040
know wow 11 [ __ ] months of hell I'll

967
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:45,558
tell you what dude no Edibles too right

968
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:48,079
no nothing no canono nothing not a

969
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:50,319
thing did the amount I was puking it

970
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,240
wasn't even worth it to even try so I

971
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:54,358
figured I'd do the full 11 months not

972
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,118
try to skimp on it just in case it pops

973
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:58,480
back up too soon yeah it's a trip it's a

974
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,079
trip a lot of people don't believe it

975
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,440
exists either until it actually happens

976
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,359
and then you realize [ __ ] that [ __ ]

977
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,440
sucks I think of the reason a lot of

978
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,279
people don't believe it is that there

979
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,519
were that there were doctors that were

980
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:16,319
trying to hang a lot of [ __ ] that wasn't

981
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:18,519
it that's it yeah yeah there's a lot of

982
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,239
people saying a just neem oil you know

983
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:21,880
it's just this it's just [ __ ] this

984
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,199
it's just [ __ ] this you know you can

985
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,960
get it from the cleanest source and it

much I know for me

988
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,119
BHO live resin I can't smoke it because

989
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:36,439
it gives me

990
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,318
instant inflammation yeah it's just not

991
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,798

try to run a a a really cannabis culture

1031
00:51:32,838 --> 00:51:38,159
themed session on

1032
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,480
Saturdays um once I get that going try

1033
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:43,199
to find uh someone who is interested

1034
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:47,440
enough in plant medicine and

1035
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:53,078
psychedelics that are uh kosher in in

1036
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:56,240
Colorado to uh use the space on Sundays

1037
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,039
to give some education and you know

1038
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:00,199
maybe

1039
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:03,239
uh share techniques I I'm not into

1040
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:05,358
mushrooms and dealing with tripping

1041
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,159
people so it's not something that I

1042
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:09,920
really have an interest in but I think

1043
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:13,639
that there's a need for education and I

1044
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,119
and I have a spot uh so but we're going

1045
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:19,239
to do

1046
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:22,960
uh do the Saturdays starting mid

1047
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:25,519
September and uh the other thing that

1048
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,798
I'm doing is I I have a uh a hemp

1049
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:32,440
license where I am doing a clone company

1050
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:37,440
yeah and uh

1051
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:41,838
providing clones walk in or uh deliver

1052
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,679
them or or ship them so yeah I mean

1053
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:46,480
that's that's a very successful way to

1054
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:48,879
to do business right now even even from

1055
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,880
the seed Market I've seen that uh a lot

1056
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,920
of seed guys are just moving over just

1057
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,720
to clones um so I'm very interested to

1058
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,519
see how that goes for you I think it'll

1059
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:59,759
be successful especially with what you

1060
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,119
got going on with the education and

1061
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,599
everything else you're

1062
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,599
doing well I think it's

1063
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:14,519
uh it makes it a lot more fun if you

1064
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:17,359
can choose what you want to

1065
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:20,119
grow and you don't just have the option

1066
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:23,759
of growing whatever it is that you can

1067
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:28,039
get yeah

1068
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,720
um and you know you have a lot of

1069
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:32,000
uh

1070
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:35,000
access these

1071
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,679
days but there's still a lot of people

1072
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:42,280
who feel like they have to gatekeep

1073
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:45,399
yeah and you know I'm not one person

1074
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:48,640
that drives with uh you know something

1075
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,880
that came through my my hands and it's

1076
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:53,960
you know it's got some like part of me

1077
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,599
to it like and I yeah I've never

1078
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:01,679
understood the

1079
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:03,798
you know you know the uh the elitism

1080
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,159
well you know Sour Diesel is is a really

1081
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:10,400
good example of you know everybody's got

1082
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:14,039

them have ever come back that isn't that

1100
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,240

hey

1104
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:18,239
hello could I get a jar or like

1105
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:23,519
something hey could I get that clone

1106
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,519
back I'll give you a sniff sorry

1107
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:28,919
what you know CSI gave me gred advised a

1108
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:31,639
long time ago and he said never attach

1109
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,480
yourself to one clone he said for many

1110
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:35,719
reasons because the second you let it go

1111
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,358
it's no longer yours and if you've

1112
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:39,159
attached your name and built a

1113
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:41,519
reputation with it what are you going to

1114
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:44,759
be left with always be working towards

1115
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:46,719
something else and keep moving that's

1116
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,599
the best way to do it don't feel like

1117
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:51,598
you've got to lock [ __ ] down don't

1118
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:54,160
attach your ego to it and you know like

1119
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,640
it it say it sounds easy it sounds

1120
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,920
really easy but when you've get get

1121
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,798
something very rare everybody seems to

1122
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,240
get that Golem syndrome you know and

1123
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:05,759
once you once you learn to get rid of

1124
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:08,358
that you get to start moving forward and

1125
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,920
uh creating new and at that point

1126
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:11,038
everybody else is using your tailing so

1127
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,400
who gives a

1128
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,200
[ __ ] I mean there's not much out there

1129
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:20,119
that's worth much more than anything

1130
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:22,679
else you know right as a flower so I

1131
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:26,640
mean I I don't think that people do

1132
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:28,078
value a a a clone really the way that

1133
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,838
they should

1134
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:35,920
um you know it's a lot of work to to to

1135
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:38,078
make a selection and yeah it should be

1136
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,838
um but a lot of these clones were

1137
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:44,359
selected you know two two seeds popped

1138
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:45,639
in a 2x4 closet and just call Delite and

1139
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:47,719
that's

1140
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:51,078
the

1141
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:53,798
Yeah Yeah man so let's see what else do

1142
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:55,240
we got I want to hear your um your take

1143
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:58,880
since you've been on both ends of the

1144
00:56:55,239 --> 00:57:01,679
spectrum um legal versus the traditional

1145
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,519
Market what were some of the pros of the

1146
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:06,399
legal Market versus some of the pros of

1147
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:10,519
traditional and and what do you think

1148
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,720
will win out in the end for uh for guys

1149
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:12,719
like

1150
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:19,199
us well I think that there I think that

1151
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:19,199
there's

1152
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,519
a the way we started is not the way it

1153
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,960
is now um

1154
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:31,519
you know I was uh an

1155
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,159
unregulated

1156
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:37,599
shop I was operating

1157
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:41,038
under medical marijuana rules which were

1158
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:43,880
kind of [ __ ]

1159
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:47,000
um and I operated

1160
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:50,838
through the the promulgation of the

1161
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,039
earliest rules and withdrew my

1162
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:57,000
application for my medical marijuana

1163
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:59,400
shop in 2011 as the

1164
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,719
regulations took a first regulations

1165
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,720
took

1166
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:10,400
effect now in all of that time to right

1167
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:13,519
now I've never seen Advocates win yeah

1168
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,119
Advocates have

1169
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,960
passion and they

1170
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:23,680
have

1171
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:28,079
emotion and they have often lots of

1172
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:32,078
energy but lobbyists win every time yep

1173
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:34,119
every time so we had a a a

1174
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,160
a a

1175
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:40,680
vibrant small business Community

1176
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:43,239
where I grew pot and I sold pot but

1177
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:45,639
that's not what everybody else was you

1178
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:47,639
had people making Edibles you had people

1179
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:49,719
making well there weren't really

1180
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,279
concentrate makers yet right at that

1181
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:55,639
earliest Point

1182
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:58,400
um but the state made everybody become

1183
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:00,400
vertical integrated and that caused

1184
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,318
people to get into

1185
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,920
relationships that were called shotgun

1186
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:07,920
marriages yeah they were forced into a

1187
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,159
business relationship

1188
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,680
so you had people that were great

1189
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,920
Growers you had people that could

1190
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:18,399
Slinger you know and they were forced

1191
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:21,838
together and in my early situation where

1192
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,200
I had a a you might have known him do

1193
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:26,679
you ever know no good names left sea

1194
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:29,759
Lucas no fors

1195
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:32,679
well I had a early

1196
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,480
partnership where I was involved with a

1197
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:37,759
you know a a Denver Warehouse that was

1198
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:42,400
along with my

1199
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:44,440
um uh my shop in

1200
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,920
Netherland

1201
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,920
but the

1202
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:56,879
uh we had a falling out at that point a

1203
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:59,719
man divorce ended up with a

1204
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,440
uh restraining order against me I

1205
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:08,118
couldn't go get my genetics from the

1206
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:10,519
place and my I I didn't lose my company

1207
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:13,880
I didn't get [ __ ] over I didn't allow

1208
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:17,639
myself to get [ __ ] over but most

1209
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:21,400
people didn't end up in a in a good

1210
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:24,358
situation or prevailing after being in a

1211
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:28,639
bad relationship so that started it all

1212
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:31,239
off and then you had industry groups

1213
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:31,239
initially

1214
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:36,159
marijuana medical marijuana Industry

1215
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:39,039
Group became marijuana Industry Group

1216
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:42,480
Mig and and those people they write all

1217
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:45,960
of it you know and and so if we fast

1218
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:49,318
forward down to today where you know

1219
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:51,480
Colorado was was very Innovative and it

1220
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:53,358
had a

1221
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:57,358
diverse

1222
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,358
businesses now

1223
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,480
the I am of the

1224
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,680
opinion that you have two factions going

1225
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,280
against each other you have the hemp

1226
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:13,000
based

1227
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:15,480
intoxicant market and you have the

1228
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,440
traditional dispensary

1229
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,318
regulated

1230
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:24,079
THC there's a lot of people making a

1231
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:26,199
[ __ ] ton of money in not THC yeah as we

1232
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,480
all know and and and not just like like

1233
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:32,318
the the Shady uh High

1234
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,440
thca yeah yeah yeah Trend that's going

1235
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:36,519
on right

1236
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,920
now but the the

1237
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:43,159
latest changes in the Colorado

1238
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:45,280
regulatory scheme I think really tell it

1239
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:50,159
all

1240
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:52,720
in cannabis is a consumer package good

1241
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:57,078
it's part of the cpg industry it's a

1242
01:01:52,719 --> 01:02:01,679
segment of the cpg industry

1243
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:05,400
the seite executives that are brought in

1244
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:07,480
to lead these large MSO companies or

1245
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,318
companies that are getting rolled up and

1246
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,719
trying to be something they're coming

1247
01:02:09,318 --> 01:02:15,599
from the consumer package good industry

1248
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:17,558
yeah so the you

1249
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:21,079
know

1250
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:23,240
pot is biologically active there's [ __ ]

1251
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:26,160
growing on it it's it's got yeast and

1252
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:28,479
mold on it that isn't dangerous yeah

1253
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,440
there is the potential for things to be

1254
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,119
dangerous and I'm not saying that

1255
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,960
regulations aren't

1256
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:36,680
unnecessary but I think that the

1257
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:40,559
regulations are heading in a direction

1258
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:44,719
where the pot that you find in a store

1259
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:47,440
is going to be sterile yeah no however

1260
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:50,838
it is that they sterilize it so pot has

1261
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:53,679
to have a shelf life it can't

1262
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:57,038
have you know when the when the when the

1263
01:02:53,679 --> 01:03:00,679
tpes are are no longer being

1264
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:05,359
produced they're beating back those

1265
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:08,159
those that those Fung funguses the black

1266
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:08,159
the what is it

1267
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,318
the god they just doing the hydrogen

1268
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,400
peroxide dip for the most part on a lot

1269
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:19,679
of this stuff aren't they no they

1270
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:23,318
they're irradiating it they are um all

1271
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:26,000
sorts of [ __ ] you know so and large

1272
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:27,239
companies they irradiate it before ever

1273
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,960
gets

1274
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:31,399
packaged

1275
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,000
so

1276
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:37,798
now in Colorado before you were un you

1277
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,119
were not allowed to sell prepared food

1278
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:45,599
like potato chips and drinks in your

1279
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:48,079
store that didn't have THC in them and

1280
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:51,000
you can't have hemp derive THC in them

1281
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:54,440
either so now the new rules allow for

1282
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,358
you to get as much as 20% of your

1283
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:59,440
revenue from selling

1284
01:03:56,358 --> 01:04:01,278
popcorn and potato chips and [ __ ] so

1285
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,318
it's it's in a

1286
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:07,159
full move towards a convenience store

1287
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:09,558
model in Colorado in my opinion that's

1288
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:10,879
the direction that it's going and I and

1289
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:14,680
I would

1290
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,000
anticipate it going that way across the

1291
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:19,239
country

1292
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:23,880
wherever those cpg companies can get the

1293
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:27,278
rules tweaked for them yeah and I think

1294
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:31,358
that the the the end result is going to

1295
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:35,239
be that we'll be able to buy pretty much

1296
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:39,038
pot across the country and at some point

1297
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:42,558
maybe there'll be exclusions but and

1298
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:45,960
some states won't drive ever I don't

1299
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:49,400
know but you go to some [ __ ] hole Market

1300
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:52,838
in Nebraska you can buy a tomato in the

1301
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:54,960
winter time you go to New Mexico or

1302
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:58,119
California or Florida you can buy a

1303
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:02,760
tomato and the type of tomato that you

1304
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:06,358
will be able to buy is dependent upon

1305
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:08,559
how it can be transported and look when

1306
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:11,719
it gets to where you're going to buy it

1307
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:13,880
yep even if you're buying an heirloom

1308
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:16,399
tomato at Whole Foods there's only

1309
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:19,039
certain tomatoes that can

1310
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:23,400
be transported that are airling they

1311
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:27,599
turned to Mush yeah um so I think

1312
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,880
that there's going to be store weed

1313
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,200
and then I think there's going to be

1314
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,720
good weed you know I think there's going

1315
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,239
to be plenty of pot plenty of cheap pot

1316
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:39,959
I mean [ __ ] I hear about people spraying

1317
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:42,719
it colors and coating it with thca now I

1318
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:46,318
mean Jesus believe it I mean have you

1319
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:50,519
heard about that stuff yeah it's got TP

1320
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:50,519
[ __ ] sprayed on it in

1321
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:58,160
extra isolate I guess yeah yeah you know

1322
01:05:55,719 --> 01:06:00,919
so that means you know what I like is

1323
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:04,159
totally irrelevant you know

1324
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:07,480
so but that's you know there there there

1325
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:11,159
is uh there's a lot of different types

1326
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:15,159
of market for pot and I am a firm

1327
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:18,798
believer that we're going to see a a

1328
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:23,000
homegrown Renaissance I we're primed for

1329
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:27,519
it dispensary herb sucks I quit I mean I

1330

I can't I

1331
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:34,519
the best herb in the dispensary is is

1332
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:37,480
way way way

1333
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:41,679
overpriced

1334
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:43,318
and and it's only a certain type of herb

1335
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:47,919
yeah

1336
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:51,519
it and it's stuff that can

1337
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:56,039
pass biological testing here in

1338
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:56,038
Colorado and not everything

1339
01:06:56,199 --> 01:07:02,639
stops the biological

1340
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:06,480
activity I mean I've had

1341
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:09,598
stuff that I have Jarred that was so

1342

there yeah and you see all this pictures

1348
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,639
of great looking weed on the hoof in the

1349
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:32,719
garden it looks

1350
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:35,440
great but someone was just telling me

1351
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:39,199
they're going to send their herb away

1352
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:42,599
off site hours away to have it trimmed

1353
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:45,118
by who knows who for 40 bucks a pound

1354
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:48,318
Jesus Christ so I mean what what do what

1355
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:50,680
do you expect yeah and it's supposed to

1356
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:50,679
be good

1357
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:57,240
weed yeah I I hope there's a homegrown

1358
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:59,798
Renaissance um where I'm at there isn't

1359
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:02,798
a a connoisseur Market of any type you

1360
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:04,639
know in Bakersfield California it's uh

1361
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:06,318
few and far between people that are

1362
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:10,159
going to be like I would rather have

1363
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:12,639
better than quantity quantity that might

1364
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:14,519
get me a little high you know it seems

1365
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:16,599
to be that the the whole attitude is

1366
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:18,798
just weed [ __ ] smoke it you know

1367
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,920
around here it would be nice to develop

1368
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,278
that but I think it'll take so so much

1369
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,880
time so many people getting sick of the

1370
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:28,520
same old [ __ ] but how how how long does

1371
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:31,679
that take to build in a in a society I

1372
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:34,480
mean because Colorado has has a history

1373
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:37,158
of good cannabis but places like [ __ ]

1374
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:40,000
holes like this not so

1375
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:44,079
much you know I

1376
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,119
mean Colorado is a place where outdoor

1377
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:51,960
herb and and and Greenhouse herb to me

1378
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:53,640
is a hard cell yeah um we're used to

1379
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:57,439
indoor

1380
01:08:53,640 --> 01:09:01,119
pot but you know the dispensaries have

1381
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:03,238
have changed everything you know it's it

1382
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:05,920
used to be called Colorado kind bud you

1383
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:09,358
know yeah that's that's not what we're

1384
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:12,158
we're working with now in general yeah

1385
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:15,600
and you know the homeg grower

1386
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:18,599
culture it was really strong it boomed

1387
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:21,359
it busted but I'm hearing of people

1388
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,560
firing up the room again

1389
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,798
so I remember there was a little bit

1390
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,080
where you were going to different

1391
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:28,640
collectives and showing what you were

1392
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:30,479
getting at different collectives uh over

1393
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,759
time and I found that fascinating as

1394
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,358
well uh to get your take on all these

1395
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:36,319
different strains and what they look

1396
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:38,159
like and what to expect from

1397
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,199
dispensaries when you were going there

1398
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:41,358
what your money would buy you they were

1399
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:44,119
all really

1400
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:47,359
fascinating well I sure love to Savage

1401

1402
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:55,640

1403
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:59,158
ideas it's you know

1404
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:02,600
there there's been like uh there's been

1405
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:05,238
bumps there's been uh you know like

1406
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:08,360
nicotine kind of pouches there's been

1407
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:11,279
jello shots the jell shot was quite

1408
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:14,119
possibly the nastiest thing ever oh my

1409
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:17,000
God and and

1410

other when they left the boardroom and

1416
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:37,000
thought that was a good idea oh I'm sure

1417
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:41,198
yeah boom yeah we got lean weed it's

1418

1419
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:46,960
it's

1420
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:50,440
uh the culture is is

1421
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:52,439
not it's not here anymore yeah I don't

1422
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:55,439
think it's it's

1423
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:58,359
uh I mean I haven't visited California a

1424
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:02,279
long time but I I hear you know the

1425
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:04,839
culture is pretty pretty crushed and a

1426
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:06,759
few people hanging on

1427
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,840
and

1428
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:15,000
uh the rosin thing has been really

1429
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:16,960
interesting to watch and uh you know a

1430
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,560
couple years ago if you would have told

1431
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,920
me that these guys would have

1432
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:28,520
welldeveloped private Brands you know um

1433
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:32,560
