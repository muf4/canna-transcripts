00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,480
against that you know I like

78
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,199

00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,639
plants I like I like plant

80
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,318
where after I harvest it I can pick off

81
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,318
a bud right off the off the plant

82
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,000
without curing it and making my mouth

83
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,479
water um that that's what I that's what

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,799
I'm always going after like the stuff

85
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,518
that I got to cure and weight I don't

86
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,519
know um I want to tastes good right off

87
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,280
the [ __ ] bat so most of my strands

88
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,438
that I work with that's that's what they

89
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:58,680
are yeah so CSI specifically wanted me

90
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,318
to ask you about lemon tree and and uh I

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,079
I got uh

92
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:09,238
I knew this I knew one of the Lemon Tree

93
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:12,159
Brokers in the bay um young guy anyhow

94
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,039
uh he he he he pretty much branded lemon

95
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,918
tree and another

96
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,798
one

97
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:23,160
um and uh you know every time he'd buy

98
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:25,159
packs he would find seeds inside of them

99
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,400
yeah so he ended up giving me about a

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,800
100 seeds a little bit more of the uh so

101
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:33,799
they're essentially lemon tree Hermes

102
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,000
seeds but the the actual clone out seeds

103
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,478
here and there so I I grew out all the

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,079
seeds um some of them popped out looking

105
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,560
like sour diesel even even kind of

106
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,399
smelling like sour

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,079
diesel and then the rest were short

108
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,519
different degrees of shortness different

109
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:53,159
degrees of that that uh that that turp

110
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,159
the um you know everybody says lemon

111
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,720
tree lemony but to me it's it's uh I I

112
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,800
smell California Orange I don't know so

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,960
to me it's more orangey but I don't know

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,560
what you want to call those turps but uh

115
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,000
so yeah I picked out the best Citrus

116
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,560
yeah strong

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,959
Citrus um grew all the seeds out picked

118
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,879
out what did I ended up with seven that

119
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:20,680
I picked out and then from those seven

120
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,478
uh came down to three of them and then

121
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,560
from those three I kept the one and then

122
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:31,639
I I gave the the guy that gave me the

123
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,519
seeds um all the pets and then he ended

124
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,280
up giving them out to a couple people

125
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:41,038
like that um GL Grand Flora Mark or

126
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,198
whatever oh yeah Flora yeah yeah so he

127
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,240
used he used one of those cuts um to

128
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,800
make his

129
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,280
melonade um what did I have I had a two

130
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,918
four I kept a two four and a I don't

131
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:57,679
remember anyhow I gave I they all kept

132
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,279
the one that was the easiest to grow

133
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,120
that had really good turps and that's

134
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,159
what the grand Flo guy used um the one

135
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,319
that I ended up keeping was a little bit

136
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,280
harder it was definitely finicky with

137
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,639
the

138
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,918
overwatering um but it had more you know

139
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,319
it had the strong it had more chirps

140
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:17,198
than the other the other ones right it

141
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,520
was just a little bit more finicky to

142
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:24,439
grow so I I don't I think that's why the

143
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:27,038
other guys never really went with it but

144
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:30,478
um yeah so not not much to tell about

145
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,918
that Hermes seeds screw them all out and

146
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,360
then started back Crossing back Crossing

147
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:39,198
and back Crossing and uh you know of

148
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,080
course I I stress out everything um just

149
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,038
to make sure they don't Herm on me and

150
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,680
and SC over again you know until until

151
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,680
they're

152
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,000
right um with the with the uh lemon tree

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,759
have you ever tried the Oregon Lemon

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,720
Diesel prior to the lemon tree I haven't

155
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,038
I hadn't no I always wondered like when

156
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,960
when people different people tried the

157
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,240
lemon tree if they see any relation to

158
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,399
it it's interesting that you see so much

159
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,160
diesel in it too because that story is

160
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,878
always kind of stuck with it yeah yeah a

161
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,160
lot of people especially guys from

162
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,000
Oregon always say lemon tree is just

163
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,800
that that um Oregan Lemon Diesel renames

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,560
yeah which very very well could be you

165
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,240
know have you um tried lemon

166
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:26,439
G yeah yeah what you think of that

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,240
comparatively to tall easy grown

168
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:33,759
plant um I don't know I'd rather grow

169
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,960
Calo maybe maybe it is Calo who knows

170
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,199
you know you know Calo like it just

171
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,000
tastes good smelled good but there

172
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,038
wasn't you

173
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,680
know yeah lemon G was pretty similar to

174
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:50,079
that um the the lemon tree is by far the

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,680
best

176
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,120
citrusy uh ganja plant that I've come

177
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,879
across out of them all like it's it's

178
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,840
got the flavor and it's got some it's

179
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,639
got a good Buzz to it and I mean I mean

180
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,758
of course it's one of those strains if I

181
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,879
smoke it for two or three days it's not

182
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,879
getting me that high anymore but um the

183
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,280
first few days it's great and tastes

184
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,599
great is actually I'm smoking some lemon

185
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:18,839
tree g33 right now how is it decent it's

186
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,399
delicious uh so I made a bunch of them I

187
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,959
ended up growing them all out myself

188
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,478
this year and uh picked out a few I've

189
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,239
been doing the little smoke testers past

190
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:31,680
few days but uh grow grow like the

191
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,799
gelato look like gelato but have

192
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,038
straight siy

193
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:42,079
Ras yeah yeah total Improvement um on

194
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,718
both I think on both strains right and

195
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,320
and that's like the ultimate goal at the

196
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,320
very end you know improve something

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,839
structure-wise flavor wise potency wise

198
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,560
like there's always there's always a

199
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,040
reason why I'm doing something right

200
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,159
it's not like I'm going to go and just

201
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,879
cross this to a bunch of everything else

202
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,639
there's always there's always some kind

203
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,519
of Madness behind the thought um it's

204
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,838
either you know like with with the ones

205
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,919
that with the uh with the lemon tree

206
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,600
reversals that I did um I I picked out

207
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,838
easy tall fast growing plants to cross

208
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,159
to the lemon tree because the lemon tree

209
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,680
is short and squat right yep yep so

210
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:23,838
wanted a tall fast growing lemon tree

211
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:26,078
flavor but Stony so everything I picked

212
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,920
out like the blue dream or the or the

213
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:29,919
pth and

214
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,919
gelato um

215
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,439
also did a GMO but that the I've worked

216
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:37,799
at GMO a couple times um it seems like

217
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,760
it spits out a lot of Hermes on me with

218
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:45,359
every cost done with it um so yeah

219
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,240
anyhow the uh I I grew out all the

220
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,440
[ __ ] gelato ones so I don't have any

221
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,440
more of those but the uh the lemon tree

222
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,920
and the oh not the tree the blue dream

223
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,240
and the pffs I ended up releasing those

224
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:58,639
just

225
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,320
recently and total Improvement on both

226
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,120
you know blue dream I know a lot of

227
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,720
people hate it but it it's still like I

228
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240

232
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,560
[ __ ] delicious

233

235
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,480
the ones that are right in the middle

236
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,600
with flavor-wise where you got a little

237
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,480
bit of that blue dream and a little bit

238
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,759
they're they're [ __ ] delicious and

239
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,120

240
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,480
100 folds like they both just

241

271
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:54,838
about uh the Hydra sore guy in Willets

272
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,399
who also had the [ __ ] chem 91 so I

273
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,440
knew he was legit because he knew all

274
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,240
the same people and like where he came

275
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,000
from and everything thing so I told him

276
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,600
I was like you know dude I'm you know I

277
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,320
just play around making seeds for myself

278
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,278
you kick down the cut I'm you know make

279
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,959
seeds and I'll give you seeds of every

280
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,078
direction so I ended up taking that um

281
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:21,239
chem 91 to back cross

282
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:22,919
3 uh and then what did I get I I got and

283
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,959
then the chem fours and all that the

284
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,559
chem1 two3 whatever came out and Caleb

285
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,518
hooked me up with all of those Specta

286
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,000
gave me all those and I grew all those

287
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:37,799
out and that four was just [ __ ] to me

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,839
was the best one flavor wise same uh the

289
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:44,879
the rests are they're good like the chem

290
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,000
91 to me is is very OG OG to me

291
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:51,559
flavor-wise

292
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,240
um but uh SF to me was way way way

293
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,599
better infinitely and easier to grow

294
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,480
chem 91's ugly easier to grow yeah yeah

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,360
that that chem 99 was was hant

296
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:07,399
so um anyhow uh I ended up giving uh

297
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,000
skunk VA seeds all you know for every

298
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:12,600
single cross that I made with his chem

299
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,078
91 um and then I gave him all the a

300
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,759
bunch of chem seeds and whatnot

301
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:20,559
to

302
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:22,958
yeah so yeah that was the uh the chem 91

303
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,439
came from him and then I gave it to

304
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:29,319

Fletch uh for the second time and became

328
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,198
really good friends after that

329
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:39,039
um yeah most of it most of all these

330
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,120
things came from back in the day with

331
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:45,198
the glass glowing Community that's cool

332
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,480
there were uh Trinity you know what's

333
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:51,278
that Trinity uh

334
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,800
TR Trinity grew um Trinity I got from

335
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,639
Caleb okay and and I and I and I've

336
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:58,240
grown that out a couple times and I've

337
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,440
made a bunch of crosses that one's that

338
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,000
one is is one where you need to grow a

339
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,399
[ __ ] ton of seeds and and root right um

340
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,278
it it comes out with all different kinds

341
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,440
of flavors and looks gross

342
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:16,759
structures um oh you know what another

343
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:21,000
uh I forgot when J gave me that uh the

344
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:23,680
clone of the CH 91 he also gave me a

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,799
[ __ ] ton of Hermes seeds from it too

346
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,519
that's cool yeah so so I I dug through

347
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,838
that and that there was some fun stuff

348
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,198
that chem 991 like some full-on indicia

349
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,880
plants popping up some uh real short

350
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:41,519
squaty like Pakistani kind of looking

351
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,879
leaves not not so thick and wide but

352
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,078
more slender and yeah

353
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,399
and yeah so there was some interesting

354
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,439
stuff in there but I I never came one

355
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,879
across

356
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,920
one that had that gas in there I

357
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,639
remember they were a little bit

358
00:15:53,919 --> 00:16:00,958
different

359
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,680
um yeah you did a a his favorite run of

360
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,078
Sour Diesel flour and I think he said

361
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:10,120
you use power flow NES flower

362
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:13,958
power flower yeah it was it was a it was

363
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,480
dirt brand it was a bag of dirt and the

364
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:20,479
guy the guy that made that was up in

365
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,839
Trinity County um that's funny story any

366
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,639
the guy that made that was in Trinity

367
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,399
County and he had like this bog or some

368
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,318
[ __ ] on his property and what he did was

369
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,159
he just [ __ ] dug that [ __ ] up threw

370
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,159
it in a chipper and then bagged it up

371
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,159
right and it and it was it was all the

372
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,000
ra back in the early 2000s you know and

373
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,919
there was no pear anything in it so you

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,720
had to mix all that [ __ ] in

375
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:46,360
um the sour diesel though he's talking

376
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,399
about is I had a I had a house in the

377
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,959
sunset District in San Francisco and and

378
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:56,879
these houses are built to grow in um the

379
00:16:53,958 --> 00:17:00,198
meter so the the garages are all tandem

380
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:02,799
style right yeah uh so you were able to

381
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:04,399
like you know build a wall uh next to

382
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,838
the garage door and then you had the

383
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,400
hole back and then some people the

384
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,318
meter like the uh the PG guys would have

385
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,839
to come in and like look through a

386
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,519
little window for the meter so they

387
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:19,399
weren't able actually to get to the

388
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,519
meter um I never did this but some

389
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,160
people could have tapped into that [ __ ]

390
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:28,720
hella easy too yeah right yeah right

391
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:32,720
right uh so I was growing I was growing

392
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,319
in this house and next

393
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,360
door I had a grower to the left of me to

394
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,480
the right of me was like uh maybe a

395
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:45,439
brothel house or something like

396
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,880
that yeah so some sometimes the place

397
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
will get skunky and it it's you know I'm

398
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,080
like two blocks from the beach so

399
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,879
powdery mildew is the thing so i' always

400
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,158
have to turn it on the sulfur burners

401
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,640
and when I would turn them on ID just

402
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,919
put it on a timer and leave and then

403
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,280
come back eight hours later right yeah

404
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,520
but every time I would come back the the

405
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,798
people store in wa place like they would

406
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,879
be all in the driveway and spitting on

407
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,639
my driveway and flicking their

408
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,039
cigarettes my

409
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,679
driveway it must have made the place s

410
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,919
pretty bad and the um one day my the

411
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,038
other grub neighbor came over and he was

412
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,880
like bro there's these things called

413
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:28,400
carbon scrubbers filters you know he's

414
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,720
like buy 10 of them a [ __ ] stinks um

415
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,080
so the sour though what I

416
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,200
found is you're going to lose a lot of

417
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:41,079
your yield but if if you rootbound Sour

418
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,519
Diesel grow in a small po the buds get

419
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:46,839
super dense on you get super dense and

420
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,960
crazy crazy Frosty and like all that

421
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:51,439
[ __ ] Turf just gets crazy like

422
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,240
concentrated for some reason but the

423
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,080
yields you lose a lot of yield tons of

424
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,880
yield yeah gets lost on that so it's

425
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,519
it's you know what what do you want I I

426
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,640
always went after the best possible

427
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,879
smoke right so yield was the last thing

428
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,038
on my mind TPS

429
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,080
first yeah yeah that's that's where that

430
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:15,000
sour came from Power flour and age-old

431
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,079
is what I used back then that's good get

432
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,159
good advice man so root bound power well

433
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,839
you can't get power flower now obviously

434
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,480
the end of that story do you mind

435
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:27,599
telling it what happened to the

436
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,839
bog to the what oh the bog guy uh so

437
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,000
yeah the power flower guy he ended up

438
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,759
getting in trouble with the

439
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,240
[ __ ]

440
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,960
environmentalists yeah uh for digging

441
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,200
all that [ __ ] out and ended up they

442
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,120
ended up shutting him out shutting him

443
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,759
down um yeah it was like an ancient like

444
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:53,119
Redwood forest bed wasn't it something

445
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:55,480
like that it was uh it was just like um

446
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,879
a pond that he [ __ ] drained out and

447
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,919
dug it all out that's all

448
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,200
and then you just throw everything

449
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,600
through a [ __ ] wood shipper and and

450
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,000
uh bag it up in these brown bags and

451
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,639
just say power flow and like I [ __ ]

452
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,359
made it killing because it it was like

453
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,000
it was all back then you know everybody

454
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,279
have if you weren't grown with it you

455
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,519
weren't cool yeah yeah my buddy goat

456
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,399
farm grew a bunch of uh train wreck in

457
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,879
the power flower and was talking about

458
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,000
it today earlier and that reminded me to

459
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,280
bring it

460
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,640
up so one of my one of the things that

461
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,639
I'm most fascinated with that you've

462
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,080
worked with that I've never I've never

463
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,200
even grown a cut of it I've only grown

464
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,399
hybrids because it's not widely passed

465
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,519
or you know is the purple Indica what

466
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,960
can you tell us about that uh another

467
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,400
one comes from archive uh he sourced it

468
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:52,880
up up in Seattle

469
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:57,120
area um short Stout grapy molded H

470
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,520
easy uh I don't know I've seen it I've

471
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,839
seen it floating around Northern

472
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:02,839
California but they called it purple

473
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,678
Kish back then yeah right um and then

474
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,279
what else it had another name to it

475
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,120

476
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:13,480
called it P was another yeah there's

477

479
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,360
and besides that I have no idea the

480
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,798
history behind it short little plant I

481
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,798
just I just remember the mold it would

482
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,679
mold so easy it was like the first thing

483
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:32,400

484
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,120
beautiful plane you know how is the

485
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,720

486
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:41,519
don't know for you oh shoot it's been so

487
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,159

488
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,839
Urkle grape but uh

489
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,720
grapy

490
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:52,399
skunky to it it's like an old school

491
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,319
purple ay yeah yeah exactly that's it's

492
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,759
exactly what it is old school purple

493
00:21:54,319 --> 00:22:02,879
afghan most likely broadleaf sh

494
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:05,440
um big big uh like arm siiz buds on it

495
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,600
indoor indoor uh different you know

496
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,320
still short kind but more like a Bubba

497
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,399
size buds on it you know yeah outdoor

498
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:14,678
though the whole the whole plant would

499
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,559
turn into a bud I've always just

500
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,360
wondered why like what what was what was

501
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:22,558
the reason that it remained so locked

502
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,399
other than just mystery you know I'm

503
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,240
just right

504
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:31,038
always if that like Albert Walker and uh

505
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,440
the Malo all all those floated around

506
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,519
the Washington area quite a bit there

507
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,440
was another one like Pez pink Pez or

508
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:41,839
some [ __ ] like

509
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,080
yeah like their they their their jam

510
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:47,599
over there more the stas I remember back

511
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:52,879
then like a lot of the sativa

512
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:56,278
plants so region has their own time what

513
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,120
this Str or that Str you know La in

514
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:00,919
early 2000s was

515
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,359
are with

516
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:06,200
purple yeah you know about every 10

517
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,798
years it seems like the trend kind of

518
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,880
changes to something

519
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:13,918
else yeah have you noticed that most

520
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,799
people lost their OG Cuts do you get hit

521
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,520
up about that lot no I'm I'm so out of

522
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:22,038
the loop dude I um I'm getting old I

523
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,079
don't talk to nobody uh I don't buy weed

524
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:26,359
from anybody uh like I don't even know

525
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,599
how much weed goes I don't even know the

526
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,959
prices anymore yeah I

527
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:32,639
I have no

528
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,278
clue yeah um the one the one thing I've

529
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,120
been hearing a lot and I've get been

530
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:39,278
getting tons of DMS from other seed

531
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,278
makers and [ __ ] no one kept OG cuts no

532
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:44,480
one so I have a feeling your your OG

533
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:46,119
seed seed uh sales are gonna Skyrocket

534
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,839
soon because it's it's heavily in demand

535
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:51,199
and no one kept him right I have noticed

536
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,879
that they uh has been doing a little bit

537
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,720
better than the other strength so far um

538
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
I I I see a lot of people are going back

539
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,839
hours as well

540
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,278
yeah absolutely it seem like it's it's

541
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:06,558
making so the gas is coming back right

542
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:09,640
and as it should because uh you know

543
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,399
weed nowadays looks [ __ ] incredible

544
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,720
it I mean it's the most beautiful I've

545
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,159
ever seen it

546
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,400
absolutely there's just not much to it

547
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,799
you know it all looks the same now they

548
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,240
all they don't really have the turps

549
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:27,158
that I'm I'm looking for and and uh like

550
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,960
OG is still my favorite that's my go-to

551
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,960
uh the gas OG's hard to beat man that

552
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:37,120
that flavor the lip smacking flavor the

553
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:41,000
flavor um and the fact is just like it

554
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:44,398
just never disappoints it always uh it

555
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,880
always works yeah

556
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:50,558
right yeah I've I wanted to ask about

557
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,799
one a couple of things so one I've heard

558
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:56,000
you mention recently it's called the PC3

559
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:59,079
and it's an nl5 Haze okay yeah the

560
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,240
PC3 uh the PC3 three was that one from

561
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:04,599
piff Coast um like I was saying that

562
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,640
that's the I grew it side by side with

563
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:11,918
the Cuban black cut and uh that PC3

564
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,200
looked looked incredible had had the

565
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,440
flavor had that deep Haze

566
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,960
flavor uh finish finish ear than the the

567
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,000
Cuban black um but for me in my climate

568
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,038
like it just it got powdery mil do a

569
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,480
little um a little too easy so that's

570
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:34,558
why I didn't stick with it like I the

571
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,360
powdery milde is [ __ ] you up out here so

572
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:40,079
I tend to stay away from plants that get

573
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,558
it super easy or plants that mold hell

574
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,558
easy or

575
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:48,319
whatnot and there was some um Blockhead

576
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,919

583
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,440
as long as you don't call Blockhead I

584
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,359
don't give a [ __ ] about you it's like

585

okay cool yeah right so love candy it is

586
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:21,278
um that you that was my cash Cropper in

587
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,759
the late 90s early 2000s

588
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:27,119
um Kush cleaner ended up replacing that

589
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:31,319
Blockhead for me but uh back then

590
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:33,439
outdoor or it finished early and it had

591
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,038
the look it had that almost an indoor

592
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,919
look where actually a lot of people were

593
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:41,519
passing it off as

594
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:46,120
indoor like a melony like a cantaloupe

595
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:50,038
melon I don't know typical spice of life

596
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:55,199
flavors um easy to grow [ __ ] hella

597
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:58,398
easy to trim produce big and just crazy

598
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:04,399
Frosty uh so like I said it was my cash

599
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:08,519
copper for days um I I uh I work that I

600
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:11,879
work that one heavily uh I back crossed

601
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:16,720
it a couple times and then I lost the

602
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:20,278
Clone and then buddy mine Kendo on used

603
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,558
to go online by Kendo yeah he he still

604
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,440
had it and and he ended up passing it

605
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,278
all throughout Oregon and then he

606
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,080
brought it back to me um so back crossed

607
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,119
another

608
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:35,639
time and then I don't remember what

609
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:38,239
happened cops came or I lost C cut uh

610
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:42,960
and then from there I started um going

611
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:46,720
F1 F2 F3 with it uh but like cash

612
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,038
Cropper again early um all like every

613
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,159
seed comes out identical there's no

614
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,319
there's no

615
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,039
variation right that's that's the

616
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,678
ultimate right like for me anyways like

617
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,319
if I release something I want it to be

618
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,120
uniform

619
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,639
right right that was that was my goal

620
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:06,119
for uh outdoor is like I wanted to grow

621
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,480
100 seeds of of one variety and I wanted

622
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:11,918
to be able to mix everything together

623
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,679
and have no one know the difference yeah

624
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,880
right um so that that's that was always

625
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,360
the goal so all like my heavily worked

626
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,559
stuff all of that comes out you know

627
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,398
identical good bre eaters everything's

628
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,319
the same you're not gonna get crazy

629
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,759
variation or nothing like that you know

630
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,759
of course there's slight slight little

631
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:32,720
differences maybe one tastes a little

632
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,440
bit more than the other but they all

633
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,240
have the same tur profile you know but

634
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,120
compared to like the lines compared to

635
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,079
the lines even 15 20 years ago it's it

636
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,558
the the uniformity is vastly different

637
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,079
though right like that's the thing

638
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,960
there'd be small differences but to most

639
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:50,319
people they wouldn't even probably

640
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,079
notice those differences most people

641
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,599
aren't going to know the differences at

642
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:58,398
all but me you know since I'm attached

643
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,839
to them and uh you know I'm my worst

644
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,839
critic um I always feel like I could do

645
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,038
better you know I got got a fridge full

646
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:06,439
of stuff that I've never released there

647
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,158
are people are like dude let them out

648
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,278
let them out but like I'm just not 100%

649
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,039
with them

650
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:17,798
so they're just tucked

651
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:19,720
away I wanted to ask you sort of an open

652
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:22,679
question here so you mentioned gelato

653
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,880
before and obviously you someone who's

654
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,000
known for working with older stuff and

655
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,039
you know preserving some of that what's

656
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
it like to work with modern hypee stuff

657
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:37,359
what are your thoughts on

658
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,278
that um I haven't worked too much stuff

659
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,839
uh the stuff that worked with I got more

660
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:46,000
her hermaphrodites out of them the the

661
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:47,519
newer stuff all all the cookie stuff

662
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,880
yeah

663
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,319
um the gelato 33 has been my favorite

664
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,080
more more because of the structure of

665
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:58,000
the plant it grows big uh super easy the

666
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,319
buds are really big it's pretty it

667
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,359
smells good super easy to grab or like

668
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:06,798
the other one right super easy yeah it

669
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:09,839
it was more the structure of it so I'm

670
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:14,839
uh this year I'm starting to work with

671
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:17,319
bringing in that look but um keep

672
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:20,240
keeping my keeping my flavors like you

673
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:22,720
know I'm going to try to get mix the uh

674
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:29,120
my first is I'm I'm going to work a 707

675
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:33,640
Kush into a uh it's a it's a Oreos cross

676
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:36,839
to Lemon Cherry gelato um did a r them

677
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,399
and they they came from uh obsolete I

678
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:42,278
did a big run of them

679
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:46,199
um like most modern stuff not much

680
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:49,599
flavor to it uh kind of like a doll

681
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,120
vanilla yeah flavor not much but looks

682
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,319
incredible there was is your decision to

683
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:56,678
work with some of the stuff

684
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,158
strategic in the sense of like you know

685
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,679
so yeah yeah

686
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,278
yeah so this cut that I'm starting to

687
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,840
work with it finishes really really

688
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:08,558
early outside end of September um looks

689
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,720
like indoor but it lacks flavor it it

690
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:15,200
lacks it lacks Soul really it um has no

691
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,319
flavor and not much of a buz to it so my

692
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,399
plan is U I'm gonna incorporate the 707

693
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:24,319
Kush grow a [ __ ] ton of seeds pick out

694
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:28,119
the ones that have the look but the the

695
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:32,119
that OG can to it um smoke him if it

696
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,959
gets me high goes round two right uh and

697
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:36,239
these are I'm going to just do fence

698
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,240
right I'm going to do and then I'll make

699
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,839
s1's of them and then I'll also cross um

700
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,679
sister plants together you know and then

701
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,720
from that just go

702
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:50,559
forward get the potency get the flavor I

703
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,000
want but have this modern day look and

704
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,158
that that's the plan I'm going to start

705
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,519
doing with everything that I like

706
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,960
smoking so I'm G first is that the um

707
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,720
the 707 Kush which is Perfect Blend of

708
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,519
the cam and ogi um yeah and then next

709
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,399
plan is with the potion get get the

710
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:13,359
forbidden fruit flavor in there and

711
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,239
uh I didn't I should have done it but um

712
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,599
well actually I didn't even have the

713
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,759
plant when I was making the lemon tree

714
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,359
ones but also the lemon in there as

715
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:23,798
well

716
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:26,278
yeah you know um early on like in our

717
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:27,839
show I talk about breeding and the

718
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,398
difference between breeding seed making

719
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,839
and and when I've when I've spoken about

720
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:33,398
you before on the show I refer to you as

721
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:36,038
a breeders breeder and I just wanted to

722
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:38,000
illustrate this is why because you don't

723
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,200
you don't do things with with no

724
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,679
intention everything has a reason it's

725
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,759
an art piece that you're trying to

726
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,440
create it's not just oh [ __ ] it I'm

727
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,839
gonna see what happens type thing with

728
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,320
everything you know so I I really

729
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,879
appreciate that I hope everybody uh

730
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,558
Tunes in on that

731
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,960
thanks thanks man and the the other

732
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:58,678
thing with that um Oreo's Lemon Cherry

733
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,679
gelato it finished he early so if I can

734
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:06,080
get the look that have it finish early

735
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,320
but have a potency of of OG's and the

736
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,519
flavor of OG's or you know whatever kind

737
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,119
of flavor that's the ultimate goal

738
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,159
that's what um that's what I'm gonna try

739
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:17,239
to work on like this next year so um and

740
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,360
they're they're going to be fem so I

741
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,880
think it'll go pretty quick rather than

742
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,839
you know like with males like if if I

743
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,159
try to chase that hype strain by the

744
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,158
time I'm I'm done making it a thousand

745
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,480
other people have already made it right

746
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,320
absolutely by the time like I'm happy

747
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,200
with it release it

748
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:41,038
it's it's it's already gone done and

749
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,880
moved on to something else so um that's

750
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,359
why I see all my like the older strains

751
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,600
with me that's a I like what you but

752
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:50,240
outdoor production like what you

753
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,839
implying here as well like the sense

754
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,319
that like on the one hand you're being

755
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:54,720
fashion forward but you're also kind of

756
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:56,398
sticking to your guns and trying to

757
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,200
preserve like what you already know to

758
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:02,678
be ideal for yourself in the end I'm

759
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,960
really making seeds just for myself um I

760
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,000
I just got lucky enough to be able to

761
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,000
make a buck off of them now I feel

762
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,639
really blessed off of it but really it's

763
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,838
like what what what do I need and what's

764
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,720
going to fit my needs is uh is something

765
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,719
that finishes hell like outdoor

766
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,358
Greenhouse more outdoor I'm thinking of

767
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:23,279
usually is it I want to finish really to

768
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,759
have the look I want it to [ __ ] taste

769
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,040
good and I want it to get you really

770
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,720
high is is is the goal and and and to be

771
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:35,199
able to like grow out 100 seeds outside

772
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:37,398
and them all turn out exactly the

773
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,519
same you know and especially now with

774
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:43,519
the whole legal market and these

775
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:45,559
commercial guys like uh you can you

776
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,159
imagine if they were able to grow

777
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,000
something like that not have to worry

778
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,000
about Hermes or nothing like that and

779
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,719
all the plants turn out the

780
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,400
same their their yield has just you know

781
00:34:53,719 --> 00:35:01,199
it'll easily go up 25% to 50% by doing

782
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,160
seed and less and less uh and less

783
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,118
problems you know insects all that stuff

784
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:08,559
you know the the seed [ __ ] does way

785
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,358
better than than a clone does absolutely

786
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,358
absolutely and now you have to worry

787
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:15,279
about hlv with clone and all sorts of

788
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:18,000
other issues too you

789
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,680
know oh yeah yeah I I experienced that

790
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,960
for the first time this year um I got

791
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:25,118
some clones and I I really don't bring

792
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,199
in clones too

793
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,960
often um we ended up getting some random

794
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:34,000
folks this year and and funky and I was

795
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,679
like what the [ __ ] going on with this

796
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,880
and started looking it up and then send

797
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:41,679
send everything to the lab and boom

798
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,640
there it is it's [ __ ] positive now

799
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,799
now I'm freaking out thinking oh my God

800
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:48,319
it spread to everything anyhow luckily

801
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,920
it didn't spread and I kept on retesting

802
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,920
and retesting you know not everything

803
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:58,159
comes back negative now but that was

804
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:02,280
kind of scary it is scary Library

805
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:05,000
right man back in the day

806
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,440
like we never had powdery Milo in the

807
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,119
90s like that that wasn't a thing at all

808
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,960
like I didn't even know about that until

809
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,599
like the early 2000s and uh it was

810
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,599
actually when Ed Rosenthal started

811
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,480
selling clones and and his uh his his

812
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:20,160
growth facilties were the ones that

813
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,199
[ __ ] were covered in it and he ended

814
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,598
up spreading power rebuild you across

815
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,399
the world with the [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah and

816
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,680
then it's just that easy what was it

817
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,880
like maybe 10 years ago the [ __ ]

818
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:35,799
russet mites and and Broad mites came

819
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,400
out that was all brand new now you got

820
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:42,400
[ __ ] hopl and whatever but that's why

821
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,280
you go with seeds no problems but then I

822
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,079
was reading that the [ __ ] hop lien

823
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,240
goes into the seed too so that's pretty

824
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,880
scary so we've talked about that a

825
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:54,559
little bit I interviewed um uh hlv

826
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,920
specialist um and she I was I was

827
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,199
getting real specific with the questions

828
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
because I wanted to know

829
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:03,358
like does this transmit in cannabis at

830
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:06,239
that 8% rate that people keep quoting

831
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,318
and the fact is they haven't done any

832
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,439
tests on cannabis and Seed Transmissions

833
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:13,800
rate they're bringing over uh rates from

834
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,838
Hops and just kind of assuming that it's

835
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,400
going to be the same but knowing exactly

836
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,318
who's working with Duds out there what

837
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,720
clones are dted and how many of the seed

838
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:23,480
makers are using them and people are

839
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,799
popping those seeds it can't be 8% it

840
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,599
just can't like it would be so massive

841
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,519
right now everywhere through through

842
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:33,800
seed distribution so I'm not sure but

843
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:35,239
yeah the tests were hops based the 8%

844
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,318
thing but it it will be interesting to

845
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:41,118
see over time how it turns out yeah

846
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:44,880
totally totally yeah no there's some

847
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,079
scary [ __ ] out there and um I'm I'm done

848
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,200
bringing in

849
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,760
clones I got I did get a really good

850
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,118
Sour Diesel this year I was pretty

851
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,400
stoked on and I grew uh that motor

852
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:57,358
breath 15 for the first time good one

853
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,440
pretty stoked on that one too

854
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,920
yeah it's nice it's nice division Kem

855
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,079
and OG is that what it is chem OG it's

856
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,480
it's it's cookies something cookie no it

857
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:11,160
no uh motor breaths chmd OG chem D OG

858
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,760
okay yeah that makes sense I get the the

859
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,920
chmd flavor comes through and it's

860
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,359
potent it's a real potent yeah it's a

861
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,159
good one but besides yeah I'm not

862
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,239
bringing in any more PLS

863
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:26,960
anymore are there are there any breeders

864
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,598
are there any breeders out now um or not

865
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,119
even now like in the past that you'd

866
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,559
like to highlight and say like yeah they

867
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,559
did some pretty cool [ __ ] and I I think

868
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:37,440
they deserve some props uh spice alive

869
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:40,679
reader Steve the the [ __ ] that he did in

870
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,240
Switzerland um yeah dude all all the all

871
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,598
the stuff that he made in Switzerland

872
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:48,719
was was uh awesome back in the day um

873
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,800
yeah looked good smelled good uh Bubble

874
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,679
Bags just came out that around that time

875
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,079
they all washed hella

876
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:59,519
good um and everything was

877
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,200
consistent you grow out a pack of seeds

878
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:05,039
and most of them all [ __ ] turned out

879
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:09,239
how they were supposed to right um his

880
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:14,838
stuff was really good and then the uh

881
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:17,118
Shanti Baba stuff back in the 90s yeah

882
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:20,000
what was really good and I'm not 100%

883
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,039
sure but I I I heard he was like you

884
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,679
know making seeds for other companies

885
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:27,639
like uh homegrown fantas seeds you know

886
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:29,118
he and he would just and

887
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,879
I remember those FAS seeds too they had

888
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,720
an Afghani that was really really good

889
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,200
and all of them came out pretty

890
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,879
consistent um I never see their stuff at

891
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:39,358
at all anymore they used to be a big

892
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,920
brand and had a coffee shop and

893
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,679
everything and now you don't see anybody

894
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,358
in nothing in anybody's collections from

895
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:47,960
homegrown fantasies anymore kind of

896
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:50,078
sucks yeah yeah with uh with because

897
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,920
I've grown out a lot of the Mr Nice it's

898
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:56,119
definitely not the same as it was in the

899
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,240
90s yeah right like uh so yeah who knows

900
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,880
but yeah those were the two guys from

901
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,838
back in the day that stood out and then

902
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,720
um I could go on forever and ever with

903
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:06,960
people that I was disappointed with but

904
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:10,199
we won't go yeah

905
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,119
right that's weed bro that's

906
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:15,000
weed I wanted to zoom out a bit and ask

907
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,079
about the other kinds of breeding that

908
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,559
sha has mentioned like dog chicken

909
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,640
rabbit breeding and like what has he

910
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:25,078
picked up from there and like what

911
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:27,279
translates to cannabis breeding um it

912
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,800
it's uh

913
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,519
man I think it's all the same it's uh

914
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,519
all like all life breeding it it it's

915
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:39,119
kind of all the same even with people

916
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:41,440
it's crazy but um it's it's all very

917
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,640
similar like you got an idea like the

918
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,200
rabbits um they're meat rabbits so like

919
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:51,719
let's say uh one of them's got a big big

920
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:54,078
legs the Hinds but but the backstrap is

921
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:56,719
is isn't as big as it could be so then

922
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,680
you know I would take a male that has a

923
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:01,679
big back strap and cross it to the ones

924
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:04,318
with the big hind legs or uh you know

925
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,759
with with dogs I always go for structure

926
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,480
I want them to look a certain way uh

927
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,240
bullies I don't know it's just the

928
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,159
ghetto of some reason I can't get rid of

929
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,399
them

930
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,799
um holy stocky look right and it's the

931
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,920
same thing you just got to you just got

932
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:26,720
to add or take away you know you find

933
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,039
um opposites I find like op Crossing

934
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,919
opposites are the best unless you got

935
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,480
something in in mind like do you want to

936
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,720
shrink a dog to hella small then you

937
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,199
just keep taking the smallest ones

938
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:42,838
reading them together or uh but it like

939
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:47,279
let's say uh for full like hybrid Vigor

940
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:52,400
uh I find Crossing opposites do the best

941
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,119
and I also like my myself I find uh um

942
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,240
like

943
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,960
people uh find the most attractive

944
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:03,439
people like the

945
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:06,920
opposite uh black white Chinese white

946
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,240
right it's so like it's all pretty much

947
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,720
the same doesn't matter what you're

948
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:14,679
breeding like um it's all kind of the

949
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:19,799
same

950
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:21,919
um yeah yeah yep traits y traits traits

951
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,400
traits traits and and the longer I've

952
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,280
been into this that's the one thing I've

953
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,358
realized like I I paid so much attention

954
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,920
to the stories that people would tell

955
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,358
about these plants and then try to match

956
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,280
up different things to the stories to

957
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:33,960
see if it held true and in the end I

958
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,200
realized [ __ ] you can just follow traits

959
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,838
from the beginning all the way through

960
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,719
these lines and see what the role story

961
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:40,799
is like you really can do that it's

962
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,719
possible if you have enough experience

963
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,039
yeah totally totally like uh I mean

964
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:49,000
let's just the the lemon tree for

965
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:51,599
example like um the Wy guy says there's

966
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,559
no sour diesel but inside of it but when

967
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,559
I was growing him out there was

968
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,720
definitely uh s Sour Diesel inside of it

969
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:02,559
right you can follow the the back um

970
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:04,439
same thing with dogs uh uh like you know

971
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,240
when you start breeding them and if you

972
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,119
get if you got a list of the parents and

973
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,039
the family tree pretty much you can

974
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,559
start pinpointing what what goes to

975
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:15,279
where and who does what you know that's

976
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,839
got to be fascinating actually never

977
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,720
thought about it that

978
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:24,000
way that's pretty cool I [ __ ] love

979
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,759
it it's

980
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,039
it's I don't know but interesting kind

981
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,480
of like psychological thing

982
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:34,679
um to kind of like deal with all these

983
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,679
possibilities and try to map like

984
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:41,279
possible outcomes tendencies that kind

985
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:43,558
of thing yeah absolutely um you know and

986
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,000
and it I would say half the time it

987
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,760
works out the other half like I always I

988
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,719
always have these things envisioned in

989
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,280
my head like crossing different flavors

990
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:54,879
how it's going to turn out this and the

991
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,960
other and rarely does it ever uh like I

992
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,800
would say you know 50 % of the time it

993
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,000
actually does maybe even less than that

994
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,039
but um it's all trial and error at the

995
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,199
end of the day it's it all comes down to

996
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,480
trial and error you know you mentioned

997
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,199
art before and I think there is a

998
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,679
distinct analogy there

999
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,199
because there's only there's only so

1000
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,799
much you can control you know you can

1001
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:18,159
only control like some portion of it and

1002
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,079
the rest of it is just uh you know

1003
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,199
charts various other parameters but that

1004
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,800
whole thing is is an art you know

1005
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:30,960
navigating that totally that's have I've

1006
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:33,519
always felt it's it's my world um you

1007
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,159
know even with my dogs like when like

1008
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,000
people walking by them I want them to be

1009
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:39,719
like oh that's one of [ __ ] Shaw's

1010
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,239
dogs right like just by how they look is

1011
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,799
is uh is the ultimate goal so do you uh

1012
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:47,000
have any thoughts on how different

1013
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,200
cannabis breeding let's see what does it

1014
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
say different how different the Cannabis

1015
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:54,558
breeding Market is now in 2023 compared

1016
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,880
to when you started the the the seed

1017
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:00,640
Market how different it is yeah yeah

1018
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,119
yeah well [ __ ] anyone with a tent can be

1019
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:05,279
make a seed company now right yeah right

1020
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,358
you got Instagram

1021
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,920
bro yeah like I I I uh like I said I'm

1022
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:13,400
out of the loop um I don't I don't

1023
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,599
really I'm just kind of focused on my in

1024
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,880
my own head and things that I'm doing I

1025
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,960
don't really I don't like I don't I

1026
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,480
don't know what anybody's really doing

1027
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,000
anymore

1028
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,519
yeah it's probably the smartest move man

1029
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,199
the least amount of Dramas involved when

1030
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,639
you keep your head low and out of that

1031
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,919
and just stick to the

1032
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:35,838
art yeah exactly exactly I I hate the

1033
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:39,680
drama behind it so I just don't

1034
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:42,519
even I'm not in it ever

1035
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,919
yeah I get the sense that like your life

1036
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:46,159
takes you in many other directions and

1037
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,440
you don't you don't need to spend all

1038
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,440
your time like in this

1039
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,318
world uh yeah you know I I did the can

1040
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:58,239
the can of community thing for a long

1041
00:45:55,318 --> 00:46:03,239
time and and it's definitely changed um

1042
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:05,239
a lot uh the past 10 15 years um you

1043
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:07,719
know everybody before

1044
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:10,358
like I mean now everything is Corporate

1045
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:13,399
pretty much you know it's uh

1046
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:16,318
yeah the handshake the handshake and

1047
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,639
your your uh your word doesn't mean [ __ ]

1048
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,960
anymore um where back in the day it was

1049
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:23,199
like that's what [ __ ] made everything

1050
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,358
turn was was a guy's word and their

1051
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,838
their handshake um

1052
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:32,159
I don't know the the whole the whole

1053
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:34,400
thing has changed uh the seed Market you

1054
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:37,879
know the seed Market actually there's a

1055
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,280
lot more people but probably hasn't

1056
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,440
really changed much at all I mean it's

1057
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,240
kind of the same like you know DJ Short

1058
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,639
Stuff let's say for example you know he

1059
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,318
came out with blueberry and then all of

1060
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:50,598
a sudden um bunch of different companies

1061
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,759
[ __ ] rebranded his his blueberry

1062
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,838
which I'm sure that all all that [ __ ]

1063
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,040
still goes

1064
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,159
on I was saying that that's never going

1065
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:00,679
to change that's always going to be

1066
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:04,480
there uh the shenanigans pretty

1067
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:06,838
much always always it's a black market

1068
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,318
you know so it's like even even in a

1069
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,358
white Market though it's just like

1070
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,480
inherently scumbags are attracted to

1071
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:16,920
anything they think makes money

1072
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:19,800
fast that's uh I I hate the legal Market

1073
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,039
I hate I hate corporate and and uh how

1074
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,160
people are like you know the I I I trust

1075
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,159
the black market a 100 times more than I

1076
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:29,279
do the Leal Market I trust people in the

1077
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:32,920
black market more than I do people in

1078
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:36,160
the legal Market absolutely there's no

1079
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,680
honor and it there's no uh everything is

1080
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,118
a dollar sign like people just look at

1081
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,519
you with dollars in their eyes uh

1082
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:44,280
there's there's no more Community

1083
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:47,800
there's no more you know um helping each

1084
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:51,599
other out or anything like that but it

1085
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:54,800
it is what it is it is what it

1086
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,160
is so with that said is there any other

1087
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,800
work you'd like to highlight that we

1088
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,598
didn't touch on that you're working on

1089
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:03,000
now or in the past you'd like to bring

1090
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,838
some attention to I'm working on uh

1091
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,960

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,720
about those there's some flavors that

1102
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,559
like I've never come across in cannabis

1103
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:38,558
in those um like just mouthwatering

1104
