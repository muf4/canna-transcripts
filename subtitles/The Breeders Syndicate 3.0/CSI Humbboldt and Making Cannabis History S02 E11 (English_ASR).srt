as my own head's cut off yeah this is a

26
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,959
professional

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
i'm just analyzing my [ __ ]

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,400
you're just super anal

29
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,399
dude i like logged in and like your [ __ ]

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,719
was like aiming at the wall

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,478
i know i i started i start off with a

32
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,158
scenery of my

33
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,118
my ceiling

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
you do

35
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,078
yeah because nobody wants to see my

36
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,000
[ __ ] face the first time they jump in

37
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:54,158
i want to traumatize anyone i i want to

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,840
be i want it to be smooth

39
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
yeah

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,320
all right

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
so

42
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,199
um

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
trying to think of how to start this

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,959
uh well i don't know what you said

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,000
because i just popped i haven't said

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,439
anything

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,239
we're hoping

48
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,000
uh

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
managing technical difficulties and

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,560
whatnot that we might be able to get a

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
csi on to chat about some stuff

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,680
yeah um

53
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,039
and uh

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
this uh

55
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,799
this friday evening we kind of decided

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,840
that we were going to maybe sort of

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
merge

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,759
uh something that's current

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
uh going on right now with some

60
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,878
historical [ __ ]

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,878
yeah right and we had an excellent

62
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,318
opportunity to do that

63
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:43,840
in the uh in the nl5 project

64
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,799
that matt and and csi have been up to uh

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,920
and nl5 probably needs uh no

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,599
introduction

67
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,359
in the sense that it's probably like one

68
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,399
of the most famous terms in all of

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,319
cannabis

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
yep uh but there's a lot of legend

71
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,000
behind it and there's a lot of

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,920
misinformation behind it and so we

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,719
thought for this episode maybe we could

74
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,679
sort of like take you guys through

75
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,598
like how it started some of the history

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,000
to it and a lot of this stuff has been

77
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,919
chatted about in various ways and shapes

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and forms but we thought it might be

79
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,079
interesting to sort of like coalesce it

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,039
all into one show

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,959
yeah uh and start from back then and

82
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,280
sort of bring it into the now

83
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,039
bring it in because modern times yeah

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,080
because you know so i mean i've done

85
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,318
i've helped with some like 90s stuff and

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,360
uh it makes me feel old but you know the

87
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,359
90s is like 30 plus years ago now

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,640
uh and the 80s when all this [ __ ] was

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
happening was 40 plus years ago now so

90
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,158
most people in cannabis have heard about

91
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,000
nl5 but it's mostly just legends

92
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,000
and there's a lot of misinformation and

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
a lot of funny cuts and a lot of odd

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,799
stories and so we kind of thought we'd

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,360
just

96
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,480
chat about those kind of aspects a

97
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
little bit

98
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,959
and sort of merge the history with uh a

99
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,839
little bit of the project that these

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
guys are doing um because they tie in

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,759
together

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,760
so

103
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:13,199
yeah i mean where do we want to start

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,640
uh you know we can start with um maybe

105
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,399
i'll start maybe we can start with just

106
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,238
the generalization you know and then

107
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,198
we'll start with some history so the

108
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,638
reason why everybody knows what nl5 is

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,560
in my opinion

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
is because of neville

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,639
right

112
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,519
uh neville

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,120
uh popularized it he picked a selection

114
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,639
uh and he used the nl5 and a bunch of

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
famous crosses

116
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,478
one of which was probably the most

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,479
famous line of all time that nl5 hates

118
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,959
yes uh and then

119
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,879
other groups and canadian seed banks and

120
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,319
all these different things started

121
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,399
using the name nl5 and l5 right yeah and

122
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,918
it just sort of became part of the

123
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,879
fabric of cannabis history yeah if you

124
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,439
will

125
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,918
right and there's a lot misunderstood

126
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,478
about it or whatever but it's probably

127
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,639
one of the most recognizable terms in

128
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:10,000
cannabis yeah i think even people like

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,160
my parents my mom my dad was who he was

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
with weed but my mom had nothing to do

131
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,039
with it she wanted nothing to do with it

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
never learned it and even she has sort

133
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,879
of northern lights as a street

134
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,560
and northern lights and northern lights

135
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,038
five and all that and so now what we've

136
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,879
got going on is as i've joked on

137
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,719
previous episodes or whatever that like

138
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,279
when i was trying to collect

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
uh a lot of old stuff it was almost

140
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,599
impossible

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,519
um but now we're kind of in this wave of

142
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,400
you know famous things from the 80s and

143
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,680
90s you know or in any form they might

144
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:44,159
exist in has has got a resurgence yeah

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,038
of popularity and interest

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
and people want to see what's up with

147
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,800
you know what was once common becomes

148
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
legendary yeah

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,879
right it's really is kind of what it

150
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,680
boils down to and so for anyone that

151
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,680
came into the weed scene later when ml5

152
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,079
was already kind of a myth

153
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,160
um you know uh

154
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,000
you know hopefully we can like clear up

155
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,880
a bunch of stuff because there's a lot

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,478
of

157
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,000
there's a lot of people that are talking

158
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,680
about the name

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,199
yeah

160
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
right yeah so

161
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,800
when we tell this tale let's go ahead

162
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,279
and start

163
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,160
with there was a man named herbie

164
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,799
sure

165
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,280
and herbie uh

166
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
went to a certain

167
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,719
hair salon where

168
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,400
the northern light crew hung out

169
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,440
and he would go to they would go to this

170
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,758
hair salon and commune and smoke weed

171
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,160
and talk stuff well this guy named

172
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,680
herbie came in and he was a veteran and

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,880
he

174
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
um

175
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,439
wanted to

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
be able to

177
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,120
grow

178
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,960
and make a living for himself so they

179
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
set him up with some lights and some

180
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,758
some of the original steve murphy

181
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,160
afghani seeds and he had some of his own

182
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,639
um different hybrids he was working with

183
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,720
mostly colombian and mexican i believe

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,478
that was the uh quote

185
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,880
um

186
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,560
yeah and and he he was the one who

187
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,598
selected this

188
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,639
nl5 clone from

189
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:17,839
er from his own work with the steve

190
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,400
murphy afghan and the hawaiian

191
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,560
so yeah i mean probably the the way that

192
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,359
people can understand it the best is

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,680
that

194
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,919
there was a loose collective

195
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
group of friends you know you know

196
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,279
acquaintances whatever in the pacific

197
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,038
northwest area yeah um herbie was one

198
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,478
there was a guy named some some people

199
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,360
call him the indian

200
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,399
uh was another one um steve murphy was a

201
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,639
different one um there was uh

202
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,959
you know a um there was a number of

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,879
different characters all involved at

204
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,478
various points and so

205
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,240
it was a mostly

206
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,079
everyone has to remember that in that

207
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,759
time in the early 80s

208
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,878
almost everything in america was still

209
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,759
sativa

210
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
and

211
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,800
blends of different sativas because all

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,839
the

213
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
all the weed that came into america

214
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,038
was

215
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,759
seeded sativa weed

216
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,439
right

217
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,439
so the core of everybody starting to

218
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,680
breed was you got free seeds with your

219
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,079
sativa weed lots of

220
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,439
lots of them and the rare [ __ ]

221
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,918
was indica

222
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,759
because indica made hash hash didn't

223
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,159
come with free seeds

224
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,280
and so indica seeds were really hard to

225
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,039
acquire

226
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,839
uh they came from people on the hippie

227
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,158
hashish trail people like sam skunk man

228
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,918
and neville and others made trips to

229
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,319
afghanistan which

230
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,120
in that era was extremely difficult to

231
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
do

232
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,959
and dangerous it's dangerous and they

233
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,839
started bringing back small amounts of

234
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,559
seeds so unlike sativa that was getting

235
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,880
sativa seeds spread out all over america

236
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,879
in every kilo that was sold

237
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,159
indica seeds were hard to come by yeah

238
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,000
so the nl story starts with a very small

239
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,559
handful of seeds

240
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,039
of pure indica that came from this dude

241
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,719
named steve murphy yeah

242
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,679
right and then of course just like

243
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,240
anybody um the group in the pacific

244
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,479
northwest up there started making

245
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
hybrids of this stuff they crossed it to

246
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
itself they crossed it to everything

247
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,679
else they had

248
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,278
and the the famous numbers of nl

249
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,199
basically

250
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,600
you know connotate like the lower the

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
number the more indica and the shorter

252
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
it was

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,000
yeah so the one two three four were pre

254
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,000
pro you know predominantly indica based

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and smaller and you start getting into

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,559
five six seven eight nine ten eleven and

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,679
they start getting more and more sativa

258
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,039
now

259
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,079
matt's already interviewed one of the

260
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,719
main characters uh in the for in in this

261
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,120
thing and he basically stated that they

262
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,759
took that steve murphy afghan and they

263
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,360
crossed it to every sativa they could

264
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,039
get their hands on

265
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,360
so hawaiians

266
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,159
mexicans colombians

267
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,639
thai indians you said indians yeah

268
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,120
blends of those things hybrids of those

269
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,319
things all back and forth right

270
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,200
so

271
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,879
the nl5 they had this buddy named herbie

272
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,759
who got involved

273
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,078
and

274
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,039
uh herbie had a hawaiian

275
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,439
okay

276
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,799
and this hawaiian was

277
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,760
um

278
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,838
you know he crossed he it got crossed to

279
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,799
the steve murphy afghan

280
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,279
and

281
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,599
the it got called nl5

282
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,519
uh for its position and the height and

283
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
the blend of sativa versus indica or

284
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,320
whatever

285
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,239
and they found a fino that they really

286
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
really liked so

287
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,360
nl5 initially was a seed line created

288
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,959
within that little crew

289
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,039
and then herbie gave back to the nl crew

290
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,719
like this select fino that he was super

291
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,519
excited about

292
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,079
and so the as best we can tell

293
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,440
it's a pure afghan from steve murphy on

294
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,838
the one side

295
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,120
and a mexican colombian we believe on

296
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
the other side

297
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,240
that was called a hawaiian because it

298
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,599
was called a hawaiian because it was

299
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,759
grown in hawaii but there is no

300
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,399
indigenous hawaiian weed yeah most

301
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,319
hawaiian weed was mexican colombian a

302
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,799
blend of those two or a blend of those

303
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
two with afghan right

304
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,799
so

305
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,479
um

306
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,039
you know and then as you know as the

307
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,399
story's been told uh this gentleman

308
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,360
um sent

309
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,120
neville

310
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,120
uh a uh a whole bunch of seeds all

311
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,679
numbered

312
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,360
right yeah and uh i don't know if you

313
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,799
have any of those catalogs handy but

314
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,919
neville's story

315
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,078
is that

316
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,240
neville's story is that he

317
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,078
was um

318
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,440
you know he did a lot of work with them

319
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,399
and a lot of them

320
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,360
as we found out were a mess because they

321
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,919
were a blend of indicas and and sativas

322
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,240
yeah but in this one seed of nl5 out of

323
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,319
a bunch of indica sativa hybrids and a

324
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,720
mass he found this plant

325
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,720
that was what he called the pure indica

326
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
throwback that showed

327
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,879
zero

328
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,440
sativa influence yeah it was short it

329
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,559
was squat it was leafy it was covered in

330
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,720
frost

331
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,278
it didn't have a lot of smell

332
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,320
um and so he started crossing this to

333
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,519
things

334
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,000
and it crossed amazingly well

335
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,278
with basically everything he threw on it

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,480
yeah so

337
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:25,360
the legend of nl5 was born

338
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,440
because he crossed it to skunk one

339
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,240
and he crossed it to

340
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,560
nl he crossed it to hayes

341
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,959
and he crossed it to ml2

342
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,119
and he crossed it to a few other things

343
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,919
uh it started showing up in poly hybrids

344
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,919
he made like silver pearl yeah and it

345
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,599
just sort of became one of the building

346
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,319
blocks of his

347
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,759
genetic library and since he was one of

348
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
the first dudes

349
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,078
that had a seed bank

350
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,519
anything that he had that he threw into

351
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:54,638
a bunch of crosses kind of went

352
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,399
everywhere

353
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
yeah right and all these things are

354
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,519
winning high times you know stuff and

355
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,600
it's getting big glossy pictures and nl5

356
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,639
haze was the most popular strain they

357
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,920
sold

358
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,959
so the legend of it just took off

359
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,199
now

360
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,518
there's a debate here because

361
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,879
what what's indisputable is that he went

362
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,919
to the states

363
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,200
and he got uh the pacific northwest hash

364
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,479
plant and

365
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,360
the um

366
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,039
and the g13 through friends of uh

367
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
another guy who's pretty famous named

368
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,039
jorge cervantes

369
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,639
some friends of his hooked him up and he

370
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,240
arranged for

371
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,399
the cutting

372
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,720
that the guys in the pacific northwest

373
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,039
were growing as nl5 to be shipped over

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,639
right yeah and so they did this they did

375
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,480
this clever thing

376
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,639
where they shipped this plant over in a

377
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
terrarium of other plants

378
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,039
and they took scissors

379
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,679
and they cut the serrations off the

380
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,240
edges of each of the pot leaves

381
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,239
so it didn't look like wheat that's sick

382
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,399
huh that's nice

383
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,240
they just shaved all that off so it

384
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,278
looked unusual

385
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,759
and

386
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,919
if neville is posted uh back when he

387
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,600
used to post on mr nice

388
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,120
that he didn't like that one as much

389
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,120
because it wasn't as consistent of a

390
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
breeder as the one he found amongst the

391
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,198
seed line yeah and so he didn't use it

392
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,519
yeah so right there you have this

393
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,719
massive confusion where everybody thinks

394
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,879
nl5 is the same thing

395
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,160
where it is kind of the same thing but

396
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,240
there's a seed line that never got out

397
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,958
there's a clone that they selected from

398
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,159
that seed line that was popular in

399
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,239
washington

400
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,399
yeah and there's a clone that that

401
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
neville found among seeds they sent to

402
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,240
him

403
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,199
and they all got called nl5

404
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,799
yes

405
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,359
and that's where a lot of the

406
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,958
confusion lies yeah so people think

407
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,519
they'll be like oh i've got the same

408
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,759
clone that neville used and all of his

409
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,720
breeding but it never left the west

410
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,519
coast

411
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,519
yeah

412
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
well no because neville says he found it

413
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,759
in seat

414
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,240
yeah

415
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,399
you know so there was there was two

416
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
select cuttings even early

417
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,919
um and you know most people don't

418
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,320
realize this but neville says his was

419
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,799
like a total afghan throwback

420
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,320
and the one that that uh the seattle

421
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,039
crew describes

422
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,278
had like two foot colas on it right yeah

423
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:24,399
big long running lime green colas well

424
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,240
yes and no yes and no if i remember if i

425
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,958
remember it was stated that they

426
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,440
combined different buds to make it look

427
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,799
like it had a massive cola for netflix

428
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,160
oh jesus yeah so that there was some

429
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,719
fun stuff going on there was some

430
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:42,240
shenanigans perhaps yes shenanigans

431
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,839
abound there was some shenanigans so

432
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,519
there's a so yeah i mean there's an

433
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,839
aspect where

434
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,839
um

435
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,198
i'm sorry i'm looking down for a second

436
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,479
because matt didn't have his catalog

437
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,078
handy i know i always do too but i do i

438
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,920
don't know if there's a bigger version

439
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:02,159
of this but if everyone wants to look

440
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:06,000
that picture right there

441
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,838
that is a picture of the mother cut

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
taken in amsterdam and put in the

443
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,800
scentsy seeds catalog

444
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,679
taken when it won a cup in 1995 it was

445
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,159
printed in the 96 catalog that is a that

446
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,319
is one of the few existing pictures

447
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,120
of an actual growing

448
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,199
nl5 that neville used

449
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,879
and you can see it's short it's squat

450
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,039
it's leafy as [ __ ]

451
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,240
you know it's got all these things going

452
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,519
on to it

453
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,879
um

454
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,399
and so

455
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,600
you know uh

456
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,600
so nl5 neville said that nl5 was prob

457
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,278
nl5 hayes was probably the most famous

458
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,519
and best-selling thing in his whole

459
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,759
catalog both at his seed bank and later

460
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,320
at scentsy yeah

461
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,480
um the nl5 skunk one got renamed it's i

462
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,879
don't know if it was renamed shiva shiva

463
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,278
skunk yeah i think it was renamed shiva

464
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,639
skunk at scentsy seeds but it was sold

465
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:03,120
the whole time

466
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,359
um so probably it was sold from 87 or 88

467
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,240
all the way through uh

468
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,958
you know

469
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,038
1999 or the early 2000s still probably

470
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,759
to this day but it's not the same [ __ ]

471
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,759
yeah um and nl5 hayes was sold

472
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,679
consistently so

473
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,119
you know it just kind of entered into

474
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,439
the lexicon everybody knows nl5 hates

475
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,438
yeah and it's gotten old enough now that

476
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,439
a bunch of people are like oh i have it

477
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,080
i have the original cutting i have the

478
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,038
this i have the that so

479
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,918
you know

480
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,319
um you know and uh

481
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,919
and and you know it it um

482
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,678
someone's saying nothing about the nl

483
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,080
crew telling neville that

484
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,798
i mean neville you know neville spoke

485
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,480
about the nl but he basically like has

486
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,599
said that he just got

487
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,599
um he just got these labeled seeds

488
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,439
and he made his own inferences about

489
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,599
them

490
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,200
you know so yeah

491
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,879
you know he had he had to make it up

492
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,120
basically like he had to think what what

493
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,559
am i seeing yeah um and then you know

494
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,319
the guys back then there it was in the

495
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,678
80s and they were all scared of getting

496
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,200
busted so they didn't really take

497
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,280
copious notes

498
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,279
no and that's either that was stated

499
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,599
several times you know and we actually

500
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,319
know a bit more about the nl5 than we

501
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,558
know about a lot of the other nl numbers

502
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,558
because of what herbie was working with

503
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,879
and what he said he crossed to the steve

504
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,759
murphy to get that nl5

505
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
yeah

506
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,599
so it's like a lot of things you know i

507
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,240
mean a lot of a lot of

508
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,558
a lot of breedings are collaborative

509
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,558
it's a small group of friends doing one

510
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,240
part at my garage and you do the next

511
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,480
part of yours and this and that and

512
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,400
everything else and who's responsible

513
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,679
for it there might be one or two people

514
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,038
that gets known for it but in reality

515
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,798
there's a whole little group that's

516
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,400
involved

517
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,240
yeah it was a kind of small group yeah

518
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,280
right yep

519
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
so

520
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,798
you know uh and then you know when it

521
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,039
comes to nl5 haze

522
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,720
uh neville claims that

523
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:04,879
right before he left scentsy about

524
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,319
95-ish uh they lost the mother of nl5

525
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,360
dope

526
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,038
it died

527
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,599
and it makes kind of sense because if

528
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:14,000
you like there's a bunch of nl5 haze

529
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,798
cuts that still are kept

530
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,798
in

531
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,279
in america especially in the new york

532
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,599
region and in amsterdam

533
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,960
and they all are basically from 88 to

534
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,918
95.

535
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,759
yeah you know there's not really people

536
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,520
aren't really like oh i got this one in

537
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,440
2002

538
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,279
um but there was a lot of fire in those

539
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,840
seven or eight years that they were able

540
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,440
to marry those two plants together yeah

541
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,678
you know and then you know uh super

542
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,600
silver haze and stuff like that was kind

543
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,880
of neville's attempt to blend the three

544
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:50,000
most famous amsterdam lines together

545
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,400
uh which was nl skunk and haze

546
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,919
and so you know now we have this whole

547
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,280
thing where

548
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,720
everything gets different names and

549
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,960
different nicknames

550
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,360
and tons of [ __ ] has nl or skunk or haze

551
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,440
blended into it yeah but you might not

552
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,879
know because it doesn't have that name

553
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
attached

554
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,480
yeah you know

555
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,960
uh no someone said i assumed it was

556
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,640
phenos of one to nine no it was

557
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
different hybrids

558
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,840
so

559
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,839
nl1 was almost pure afghan

560
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,158
nl2 was another afghan that they

561
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,439
actually got like a kush type afghan

562
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,840
from the indian

563
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,919
and they blended that to steve murphy

564
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,079
yeah three and four are sort of lost to

565
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,919
time nobody has them but they were also

566
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,038
you know they started increasing amounts

567
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,440
of sativa and 5 through 11 were just the

568
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,359
nl crews crossing

569
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,000
that afghan to different sativas yeah

570
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,959
and you know the more the higher the

571
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,359
number

572
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,519
the taller the plant the more sativa

573
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:54,319
influenced yeah

574
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,158
right yep that's how we know it

575
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,639
so if you look around

576
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,280
uh at some of neville's early catalogs

577
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,400
you can see him playing around he uses

578
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:07,279
the eight he uses the five he uses the

579
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,880
nine he's got the one and the two you

580
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,879
know all these different things and then

581
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,039
after three or four years he decided

582
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,360
basically that he was only gonna breed

583
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,000
with the one the two and the one cutting

584
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:21,359
of the five that he found yeah and so

585
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,519
all these other hybrids kind of go away

586
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,000
because probably because they were mixes

587
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,519
of extreme sativas with indicas and they

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,599
were probably a lot more of a pain in

589
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,240
the ass for a breeder to tame

590
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,599
yeah and he did have high high as far as

591
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,480
his keepers he did use a uh

592
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,399
a rigorous selection so he didn't keep

593
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,240
he went through a lot of seeds to find

594
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,000
out what he kept and the indian i

595
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,159
believe the indian was native american

596
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
but i can't say that for sure but he was

597
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,520
he was native american but he was he was

598
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,359
part of the pacific northwest crew yeah

599
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,798
and a lot of these guys aren't aren't

600
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,639
well known and don't want to be the

601
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,480
well-known because in the 80s especially

602
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,080
in the late 80s there was a series of

603
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
rolling busts and they all got in

604
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,199
trouble

605
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,720
yeah uh so it was a hard time to be a

606
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,038
cultivator

607
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,279
you know uh cleaning up green merchant

608
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,359
yeah yeah and all that it was there was

609
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,519
a lot of persecution back then there was

610
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,519
a lot of secrecy back then that's part

611
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,960
of why they didn't keep copious notes

612
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,240
because they didn't want them to be used

613
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,079
against them in a court of law later on

614
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,400
um and so

615
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,079
you know but basically i see i think

616
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,559
it's fair to say that the reason why

617
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,720
everybody knows nl5 is because of

618
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,720
neville that i think that's fair i think

619
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
everybody agrees with that too because

620
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,839
he

621
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,319
and even like the seattle guys will say

622
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,879
that if they hadn't sent it to neville

623
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,158
it likely would have been lost yeah

624
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,679
because they went through a rolling

625
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,760
series of busts

626
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,320
and had issues

627
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,839
yeah you know so it so it was sold at

628
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,918
neville's seed bank

629
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,158
for a number of years

630
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,320
and then it was sold at scentsy for a

631
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,559
number of years after that

632
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:02,639
uh never pure

633
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:04,079
right uh always a hybrid skunk one haze

634
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,880
nl2

635
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:10,158
silver pearl other poly hybrids blended

636
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,840
together but never really by itself yeah

637
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,440
so there was a pure seed line of nl5

638
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,000
but nobody got it

639
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,720
it wasn't sold it didn't make it to out

640
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,359
of amsterdam it was given to like a

641
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,440
couple people and even like even gret

642
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,439
you know uh even like some of the

643
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,240
seattle guys said that there was a

644
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,880
couple of cuts that got out

645
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,279
the eight the nine and maybe one and

646
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,559
maybe one of the twos from the indian

647
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:42,240
but nothing else yeah so the five

648
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:44,399
survived because it went to amsterdam

649
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,759
basically yeah that it's that's the only

650
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
reason it survived that's the only

651
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,119
reason why it survived so

652
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,360
if you listen to the seattle crew they

653
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,839
had one version of nl5 that they kept as

654
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,199
a cutting and kind of cropped out

655
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,319
uh neville found a breeder that he kept

656
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,000
you know

657
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,319
yeah and

658
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
you know it kind of it kind of went into

659
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,439
it kind of went into legend

660
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,919
um you know and so

661
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,519
you know uh and so yeah i see all kinds

662
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,400
of people what's up with this person's

663
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,240
nl1 what's up with this nl5 what

664
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,679
happened is is because it became so

665
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,159
famous okay two things happened one

666
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,400
is that in amsterdam anytime anything

667
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,000
gets famous people get seeds of it and

668
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,159
they white label it

669
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,679
yeah right and they offer up their own

670
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,559
versions of it

671
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,480
okay

672
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,119
and then on top of that when the

673
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,640
canadian seed companies got involved

674
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,798
they ended up buying a bunch of stuff

675
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,960
from amsterdam blending it to canadian

676
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,879
strains and claiming

677
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,919
that they had these things for sales

678
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,720
purposes

679
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,038
yeah

680
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,360
you know so you get and and they all

681
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,158
have sort of dodgy history

682
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,479
yeah

683
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,720
when it comes to provenance what i've

684
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,720
what i've told you so far is pretty much

685
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,720
factually agreed to

686
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,278
by the people that sent it to neville

687
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,240
and neville yeah and people around

688
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,558
neville

689
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,880
yeah you know and then it gets famous

690
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,480
and there's a proliferation of people

691
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,960
and seed banks that claim to have

692
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,480
various stuff

693
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,278
but they weren't passing out this

694
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,038
cutting to other people no they weren't

695
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,359
sharing it just so other people in

696
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,519
different continents could like

697
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,439
make their own seeds with it

698
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,158
it wasn't like today where people were

699
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
trading seeds back and forth

700
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,679
you know and

701
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,960
clones back and forth especially to

702
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,360
competitors

703
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,798
you know the dutch are extremely

704
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,678
business oriented

705
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,839
very

706
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,840
they're not going to just like grow out

707
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,640
and yeah that's why matt's laughing

708
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
because they very are very much business

709
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,919
oriented if they have a cut and everyone

710
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,360
else wants it and they're breeding off

711
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,880
it and making money

712
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,399
there's not really a chance they're

713
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,159
gonna share that [ __ ] thing and

714
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,640
there's a definite chance everybody's

715
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,919
gonna say that they have it yeah there's

716
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,600
a definite chance that everyone's going

717
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,640
to say they have it and they're going to

718
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,240
use that any name that becomes famous

719
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
in cannabis

720
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,319
gets used

721
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,879
yeah

722
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,960
you know so someone asked about you know

723
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,760
and so um

724
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,240
that's kind of like that's kind of where

725
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,240
nl5 you know just got crossed to some

726
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,440
very famous things and neville made some

727
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,359
very [ __ ] famous lines off it

728
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,360
and there wasn't that much weed strains

729
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,879
back then and the combination of that

730
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,038
and high times

731
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,760
being like the premier magazine in the

732
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,158
90s and you get all these high quality

733
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,480
glossy photos and all the

734
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,960
the cannabis cups and there was only one

735
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,798
cannabis cup a year yeah

736
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,200
so this [ __ ] got

737
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,879
hella famous

738
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,319
legendary

739
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,440
you know yeah

740
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:52,879
and um yeah

741
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,240
and what about another one what's that

742
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,720
what about nl1 oh denali's question

743
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,319
oh i didn't see it i mean ml1 is is

744
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,919
probably the closest thing to steve

745
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,558
murphy afghan

746
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,278
um it's it's it's got a little bit of

747
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,200
discrepancy between the guys involved as

748
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,798
to what exactly is in it

749
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,480
yeah um but

750
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,639
you know it's that's kind of irrelevant

751
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,240
because what actually got sold is what

752
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,840
got sent to neville

753
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,038
and everybody should know that neville

754
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,000
got it in

755
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:24,398
in uh in 8485

756
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,240
and spent two or three years

757
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,599
seeing what he had so if you bought

758
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,359
northern lights in 85 or 86 or even 87

759
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,918
from his catalog

760
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,519
it was a [ __ ] hodgepodge of any of

761
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,240
the lines

762
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,240
all blended together yeah it wasn't

763
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,839
until about 88

764
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,319
that uh

765
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,599
um it wasn't about i'm gonna turn off my

766
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,439
light because people are bitching it

767
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,558
wasn't about till 88

768
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,278
that uh

769
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,599
he started coming out with nl1 nl2 and

770
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,119
nl5 yeah

771
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,480
right

772
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,719
and uh

773
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,360
you know and so and then so then these

774
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,038
numbers get attached i think

775
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,079
1989 late 88 is when nl5 hayes got

776
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:06,960
released

777
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,199
yeah

778
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,000
and nl5 skunk one

779
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,159
and nl5 this and so

780
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,839
nl1 and l2 you know when it went to

781
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,360
scentsy um you know they just called 801

782
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:23,439
northern lights

783
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:26,079
yeah and they called nl2 hindu kush

784
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,440
uh and so lots of people got nl because

785
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,519
it was one of the most common things

786
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,360
sold

787
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,480
yeah sorry i had to screenshot something

788
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,759
that's funny

789
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,120
no

790
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,558
yeah it's hard i mean people ask

791
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,959
questions sometimes i'll get it

792
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,319
sometimes not it's really hard to like

793
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
pat your head and rub your stomach at

794
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,798
the same time so like

795
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,960
i try to chat about something and sound

796
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:49,119
like you know fairly have a have some

797
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,399
flow and then i read a question and i

798
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,000
think about it and all of a sudden i'm

799
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,038
not talking and i'm just staring at the

800
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
screen so forgive me uh for all that you

801
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,158
know if i it's a little adhd yeah if i

802
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,079
miss your question i'm i'm sorry it's

803
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,840
just the way it works so you know i've

804
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,439
chatted about this a bunch before on

805
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,038
some of the previous podcasts and a

806
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
little bit more detail

807
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,038
but

808
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,038
that's what got it famous

809
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,639
right that that is the story that is

810
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,879
that is that is the story and so now

811
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,480
anytime anything becomes famous

812
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,640
you know it's kind of like music or

813
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,720
fashion or something like that it gets

814
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,880
[ __ ] recycled

815
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,720
right

816
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,720
and most people don't know about it and

817
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,960
then all of a sudden people are like

818
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,399
i've got this ancient nl5 cut and i'm

819
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,200
making beans with it

820
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,519
i've got this this this you know um you

821
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,159
know and maybe maybe matt you could

822
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,759
explain the boof cut or the

823
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,200
the new i

824
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:46,879
i don't know i i've never talked to

825
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,960
bodhi about that one and i keep meaning

826
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,360
to ask him because people ask it a lot

827
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,120
but i don't know the the history on that

828
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,398
one

829
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,558
so i mean people

830
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:00,000
you know and you know people asked about

831
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:01,839
bob hemphill and you know uh and and

832
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,319
ella and stuff like that and so people

833
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,158
have been people you know

834
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,240
it's really hard when you get seat when

835
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,360
you get seeds and lines that are that

836
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,319
are 25 30 years old plus

837
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:18,319
uh provenance on it becomes difficult

838
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:20,639
right you know um apparently you know uh

839
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,798
hemp hill used to work with uh the

840
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,880
coastal seeds collective

841
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,759
uh and apparently you know he got it

842
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,760
through some friend of cogus

843
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,839
you know um but nl1 was sold for you

844
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,079
know what probably 20 years yeah for a

845
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,079
long time for a long time it was it was

846
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,678
sold it was and there was never a

847
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,599
specific cut

848
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,640
i mean neville had some breeding males

849
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:47,599
that he used uh nl1 and nl2 and

850
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,200
neville's thing was almost always males

851
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,558
yeah they were part of his breeding

852
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,278
males and so it wasn't like nl5 well

853
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,038
while never neville just had one cutting

854
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,759
that had to be kept alive

855
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:02,240
yeah nl1 was kind of like a line

856
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,158
yeah and so any like urban poison or

857
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,319
something right yeah so anytime there's

858
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,159
a line it's a lot harder to lose the

859
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,158
line

860
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,919
than it is when you're dependent on one

861
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,799
specific cut

862
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,559
to stay alive and keep going yeah and

863
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,398
the other thing much easier

864
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,480
just because these these [ __ ] dutch

865
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,798
guys are such businessmen when you're

866
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,240
not sharing a cut amongst your homies

867
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,480
and your good friends

868
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,038
it exponentially increases the chance

869
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,440
that some kind of disease or accident or

870
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,720
drought or worker error is going to kill

871
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,480
your [ __ ] cut

872
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,640
that greed will get you and then you

873
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:42,319
haven't shared it so it gets lost

874
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,399
right yep uh and you know and so

875
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,158
uh ben and alan drunkers aren't generous

876
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,479
people

877
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,640
no they weren't sharing they weren't

878
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,839
sharing [ __ ] with anybody

879
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,960
you know

880
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,959
um and uh you know so i don't know i

881
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,840
mean it it uh

882
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,519
nl5 is super famous nl is super famous

883
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,000
that we went through probably a 10 year

884
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,159
period where nobody gave a [ __ ]

885
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,919
uh probably starting right around the

886
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,240
kush sour going into cookie era yeah uh

887
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,640
where old things were just old and

888
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,599
unpopular

889
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,919
right yeah that it's just yeah things

890
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,879
like northern lights skunk one

891
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,480
these were cheese things that that like

892
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,080
people are kind of looking at now like

893
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,880
oh they got the [ __ ] cheat they got

894
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,519
they like if i saw that in a in a store

895
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,240
with tons of cool clones in you know the

896
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,278
early mid 2000s it's like

897
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,278
huh

898
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,558
give me some of that new [ __ ] nobody was

899
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,278
worried about that because it was so

900
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,639
abundant oh you know i mean we had it i

901
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,159
can't remember who said it but it's

902
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,720
absolutely true

903
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,760
you know 15 20 years ago you you bought

904
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,000
seeds from nirvana gypsy nirvana and you

905
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,759
got free skunk one seeds because he

906
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,679
might as well because you had so many of

907
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,960
them and it was so common

908
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,519
it was you know you had to give them

909
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,159
away yeah because nobody wanted to buy

910
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,759
them yeah it was super abundant and so

911
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,880
there's a thing where everything's so

912
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,960
common

913
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,440
why would anyone want it and people's

914
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,679
tastes and change you know people's you

915
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,120
know taste changes and then it becomes

916
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,919
rare

917
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:18,000
and then people want it again yeah but

918
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,278
most people in cannabis don't hold on to

919
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,119
anything unless it's currently

920
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,359
profitable

921
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,759
so what once becomes we've we've seen it

922
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,678
over and over and over and over again

923
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,038
um you know where something that was

924
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,120
once abundant

925
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:35,200
yeah becomes uber rare or lost to time

926
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,798
like i'll say it straight up if it you

927
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,200
know hopefully he pops on here this

928
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:42,079
evening but if it wasn't for csi loving

929
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,159
the urkel and breeding with it a ton

930
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:47,038
most people wouldn't have access to it

931
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,080
yeah his prolific breeding is probably

932
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,519
the reason why that genetics survived

933
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,359
yeah and i'm not saying he's the only

934
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,599
person that held it

935
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,038
no but it but yeah it got down i used to

936
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,639
know i mean we're not going to talk

937
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,558
about purples very long here tonight but

938
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,200
like i used to know

939
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,359
dozens upon dozens of growers 15 years

940
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,880
ago that ran herckle

941
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,199
and you and then

942
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,240
diesel and kush gets popular and like

943
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,319
six people held onto it yeah

944
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,398
literally yeah it's yeah that's how it

945
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,480
goes dude and it's not and the reason

946
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,199
why i brought that up is because that's

947
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,679
how super skunk became almost extinct

948
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,239
that's how nobody can find the the the

949
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,358
dead skunk terps that's how all these

950
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,358
things become rare or hoarded or extinct

951
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,319
is they're so common nobody thinks they

952
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,239
need to care to preserve it and then

953
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,480
hippies and growers start looking around

954
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,638
at who's got that old school

955
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,119
and they can't [ __ ] find it and a lot

956
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,119
of times the name game happens it'll get

957
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,679
a different name or you know someone

958
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,039
makes seeds with it and it has a

959
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,559
different name that it carries on with

960
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,159
so people don't even know to look in

961
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,960
that direction for

962
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,960
said

963
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,199
one of these baselines yeah we've talked

964
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,760
about that before too where i love the

965
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,639
counterculture aspect of americans

966
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,599
giving weed nicknames yeah but for

967
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,519
lineage it's a real pain in the ass no

968
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,440
it's terrible because we take whatever

969
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,800
the name of the actual thing is and it

970
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,480
gets a nickname

971
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,680
and then it goes to a different crew and

972
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,440
they give it a different [ __ ]

973
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,279
nickname yeah and then it goes to this

974
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
other crew and they give it a spin on

975
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,240
that name

976
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,919
yeah and then 20 years goes by and

977
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,879
you're trying to trace what the hell it

978
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,280
is yeah plain telephone and you gotta go

979
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,680
through four or five nicknames back and

980
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,440
then you get to the core thing

981
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,799
and then you and then the trail goes dry

982
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,960
so you know

983
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,240
i mean uh

984
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,880
so now

985
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:43,279
after 10 or 15 years of nobody giving a

986
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,720
[ __ ] about northern lights

987
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
it's hot

988
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,078
yeah people want to try these ancient

989
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,439
things that they grew up when they were

990
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,760
kids reading about

991
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,599
or these the first wheat the first like

992
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,359
true famous wheat

993
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,359
yeah you know they want to see what's up

994
00:35:55,358 --> 00:36:00,319
they want to see what's up with it and

995
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,920
uh you know and so now because there's

996
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,200
interest

997
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,800
now all of a sudden where there's

998
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,319
interest there's economy and people

999
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,519
start popping up with it

1000
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,960
yeah

1001
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,880
all over the place and most people

1002
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,760
probably don't know that there was two

1003
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,480
completely distinct cuts that were used

1004
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,320
one from america and one from holland

1005
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,320
yeah and there was a seed line but it

1006
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,680
was given out to nobody and then you see

1007
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,119
stuff where i've got nl5 pure

1008
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,919
well how

1009
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,240
yeah lots of that right how

1010
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,559
yeah you know

1011
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,639
you know i mean you can you can talk you

1012
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,599
can you can know that that neville had

1013
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:37,679
it pure

1014
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,000
because the guy that made it says i sent

1015
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,960
it to him pure along with the rest of it

1016
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,119
yeah

1017
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,119
and neville says i got it pure from dude

1018
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,519
okay they both agree

1019
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,440
here's when i sent it it exists but did

1020
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,679
you share with anybody no

1021
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,400
so everybody has a bunch of hybrids

1022
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,759
or canadians got it and sold their [ __ ]

1023
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
and then people get it and it's got a

1024
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,960
name attached and they're like

1025
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,159
you know um

1026
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,519
there it is

1027
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,838
yeah

1028
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,759
you know and because we're cannabis and

1029
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,920
because all of our stories are kind of

1030
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,280
black market or underground or

1031
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,760
prohibition

1032
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,359
it gets really difficult to

1033
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,800
sometimes it comes down to who you

1034
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,559
choose to believe

1035
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,400
yeah and that's a lot of the time with a

1036
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,039
lot of these strains and so some people

1037
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,720
will get like nl and they'll and the guy

1038
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,480
will be like i've had this for 30 years

1039
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,358
and never left the west coast it's it's

1040
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,119
this

1041
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,279
yeah and they're like great it's this

1042
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,720
that's all the proof i need

1043
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,240
let's start breeding with it and it's

1044
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,078
this

1045
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:40,239
and now it's labels all over the place

1046
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,160
and people are buying it and is it that

1047
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,879
one thing one thing i also noticed was

1048
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:47,838
that during the philos era

1049
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,960
um a lot of people would get said clone

1050
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:54,159
that they got with dubious heritage or

1051
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,119
whatever they submitted to philos

1052
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,039
and

1053
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,880
by doing so say that

1054
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,838
philos verified their clone is

1055
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,280
legitimate you know god yeah yeah that

1056
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,440
happened that started happening a lot

1057
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,839
too and that was a real problem because

1058
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,440
and as we learned um

1059
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,279
allegedly

1060
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,559
yeah philos couldn't

1061
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,640
tell people

1062
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,279
any kind of plant relation with any

1063
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,118
consistency

1064
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,920
that maybe we should say this

1065
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,599
about csi is that it doesn't matter what

1066
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,400
it is but csi sent and fi this is how

1067
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,640
matt myself and csi discovered that

1068
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,119
philos was really really really full of

1069
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,440
it um we had some evidence before but

1070
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,800
this was kind of one of the big kickers

1071
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,599
was that uh csi had made a cross

1072
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,039
uh and he sent in both parents

1073
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,838
and i don't know if he wants the story

1074
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,199
out so much no yeah no i'll shut up

1075
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:49,759
about it then i didn't even mention what

1076
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:52,159
it was but i'll just say this we we

1077
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,560
discovered that their genetic sequencing

1078
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,000
wasn't as strong as we would have hoped

1079
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:59,119
yeah yeah it was it was definitely

1080
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,719
disappointing with the consistency of it

1081
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,200
you know and so people thought that

1082
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,959
their genetic testing was like american

1083
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,799
genetic testing

1084
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,639
yeah where you can have 23 and me or

1085
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,640
some [ __ ] and be like oh my god i'm five

1086
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,719
percent norwegian

1087
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,400
and you know grandpa was from germany

1088
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,559
and this guy and i'm like and i'm part

1089
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,200
african or whatever yeah and we were

1090
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,519
hoping that same kind of accuracy would

1091
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,199
be transferred into weed

1092
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,358
yeah and i'm

1093
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,480
trying to move caleb

1094
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,799
well we'll see

1095
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,400
caleb click the thing and say request to

1096
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,880
join if you can

1097
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,880
if you if you see how to do that

1098
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,559
hit the request to join button so i can

1099
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,200
uh add you in

1100
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,199
when you got time

1101
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:43,679
all right go ahead

1102
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,440
yeah so i mean it it um and you know in

1103
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,679
order the other the other thing about it

1104
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,400
is is for like talking about human

1105
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:53,279
genetics is geneticists can go to like a

1106
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,760
pure norwegian or a pure japanese or a

1107
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,359
pure chinese whatever and they can start

1108
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,599
comparing dna

1109
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,440
yeah and seeing these different things

1110
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,760
and they know how to sequence it if it

1111
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,880
would be amazing if dna evidence had

1112
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,280
existed

1113
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,240
in holland in the 80s

1114
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,400
and

1115
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:14,000
neville and and sssc and and scentsy and

1116
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,240
these early groups would have been able

1117
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,599
to like put down markers of what was

1118
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,479
what

1119
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,599
yeah

1120
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,358
and then we could have seen their

1121
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,838
descendants because you'd have something

1122
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,039
to compare it to

1123
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,880
yeah

1124
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,358
but that's not always the case that's

1125
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,680
not always the case so absolutely you

1126
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:37,159
know uh so it remains a dream because

1127
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,159
here he is

1128
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,279
sir your lighting is terrible but if you

1129
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,119
just you look like you look like you're

1130
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,760
on 60 minutes and you're one of those

1131
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,760
like grayed out you know like guys under

1132
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,839
the witness protection program it's too

1133
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,079
bright in here it's too bright there

1134
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,078
yeah

1135
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,639
too bright

1136
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,920
yeah yeah

1137
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:59,920
i ain't trying to you know

1138
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,799
oh you look beautiful oh thank you thank

1139
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,800
you

1140
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,640
so maybe i talk a lot so maybe i'll do

1141
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,240
like an introduction

1142
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,759
not that one's needed and then i'll shut

1143
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,239
up and get out of the way

1144
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,400
so part of the reason why we did we we

1145
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,759
decided to do this selection tonight was

1146
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
because it blends

1147
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,319
uh something that's currently going on

1148
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,039
with something that's extremely famous

1149
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,400
and uh has a bunch of history to it so i

1150
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,400
just spent a whole bunch of time

1151
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,200
chatting about the history of it

1152
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,838
and the simple and maybe like you know

1153
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,879
mellow way to talk about it is that uh

1154
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,519
in in our search of history we started

1155
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,640
getting in contact with some of these

1156
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,400
uh original northern lights crew people

1157
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,279
and hearing their story

1158
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,838
and as part of that uh we got we got

1159
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,839
some seeds

1160
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,039
uh matt got some seeds and

1161
00:41:52,559 --> 00:42:00,719
um matt uh and and caleb here uh decided

1162
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,639
to collaborate on it uh and and caleb

1163
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,559
donated some space and some time and

1164
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:07,118
some energy and they

1165
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,199
uh did a bunch of stuff uh both growing

1166
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,160
out phenos looking within the line

1167
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:14,799
making hybrids and all that and so

1168
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,799
uh i was i was involved as much as

1169
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,839
listening to them talk about it so i'll

1170
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,800
shut up

1171
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:23,679
and turn it over to them because uh they

1172
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,280
are about to offer up some seeds of what

1173
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,759
they have going on

1174
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,400
uh and it might be you know some of the

1175
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,440
first real nl to come on the market in a

1176
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,760
while

1177
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,599
um so matt and caleb why don't you chat

1178
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,599
about what you found and what you saw

1179
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,079
and what interested you and

1180
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,079
da da da da well first things first you

1181
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,039
know i'm you know when i post it up on

1182
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,560
ig

1183
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,000
you know there's there's a few people

1184
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:46,719
who are like you know

1185
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,239
what

1186
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,959
what did matt have to do with any of

1187
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:50,399
this

1188
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,318
you know and

1189
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,318
their question i wouldn't even be

1190
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,719
growing these things if matt khan you

1191
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:59,838
know had all that dialogue with you know

1192
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,838
mystery man

1193
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,079
and you know he he's the one who you

1194
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:07,199
know put all that together he's the one

1195
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,200
who sourced these seeds essentially so i

1196
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,159
wouldn't be growing nothing without matt

1197
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,199
you know

1198
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:15,039
making that first step so yeah

1199
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,719
maybe maybe i'll throw in one more thing

1200
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,559
so everyone knows

1201
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,879
when you know breeders like us get

1202
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,119
together it's super common

1203
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,160
for some breeding to be a collaborative

1204
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,559
process

1205
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:29,199
right right this guy's got some seeds

1206
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,960
you know they both have an idea this

1207
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,879
other person has some room that they're

1208
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,280
willing to put towards the idea or a

1209
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,880
greenhouse or some indoor space they

1210
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,200
come up with a plan

1211
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,838
and you breed together

1212
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,159
right and people might not hear the jj

1213
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,400
of the transaction but but every but

1214
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,639
everybody everybody you know lots lots

1215
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,639
of friends who are breeders kind of

1216
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,799
collaborate on little things like that

1217
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,719
all the time

1218
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,160
it's super common just so people just so

1219
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:58,000
people know so

1220
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,239
you know um

1221
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,400
you know matt had the seeds

1222
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:06,559
uh you know csi had the space in skill

1223
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,200
you know and skill and you know and

1224
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,679
ability uh we all had the interest in

1225
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,000
the history behind it and really wanted

1226
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,838
to see what was in there and so it you

1227
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,400
know the project happened

1228
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,480
right and uh you know some people know

1229
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,519
some people don't that the very first

1230
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,599
you know clone i ever grew came from my

1231
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,280
dad and that was northern lights back in

1232
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,160
1994

1233
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,560
you know so tell us about that one dude

1234
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,960
i mean you know i remember

1235
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,679
i mean i rocked it on and off until

1236
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,599
about 2002 when i lost it

1237
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:44,399
and uh it was a cola plant super frosty

1238
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:48,240
a decent density you know not not like

1239
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,039
rock hard girl scout cookies or anything

1240
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,358
i

1241
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:54,318
i describe the nose but i'm absolutely

1242
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,960
horrible at describing you know

1243
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,759
the smells so when people ask i'm like

1244
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,760
it smells good i don't know

1245
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,599
that's not my forte i

1246
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,680
i'm more of a visual you know oh it

1247
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,920
looks like this you know similar to this

1248
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,159
in the looks department blah blah blah

1249
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,720
you know other than you know it smells

1250
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:16,879
great or whatever whatever

1251
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,879
i'm not the dude for for the sniffer

1252
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,838
yeah

1253
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:23,039
um

1254
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,639
but yeah yeah i mean

1255
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,800
when you lost it was it something you

1256
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,239
kept looking for like when you when you

1257
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,880
were picking up clones

1258
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,399
oh yeah oh yeah yeah no it was one of

1259
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,400
the things that you know

1260
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,800
uh family and friends you know all had

1261
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,200
it and then you know i lost it and i

1262
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,960
went looking and nobody had it

1263
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,480
everybody lost it you know that's how it

1264
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,559
goes

1265
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,519
yeah but people are asking if it purpled

1266
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,480
no

1267
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,519
no

1268
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,599
no

1269
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,480
not not the one i got from my dad um

1270
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,280
yeah

1271
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,159
i don't i don't really recall it

1272
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,240
even remotely having any type of purple

1273
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:04,719
to it at all yeah and and these these

1274
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,078
you know nl5 seeds that you know

1275
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,799
i just ran

1276
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,680
there was very very little if any you

1277
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,280
know

1278
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:16,159
actual purple to any of them so yeah you

1279
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,960
know um but then again uh

1280
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,118
sometimes when you're making seed uh

1281
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,079
you know the purple traits trying to

1282
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,160
kind of tend to take a back seat yeah a

1283
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,640
lot of a lot of purple things will be

1284
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,399
halfway green you know or all the way

1285
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,960
green you know

1286
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,639
uh when they're making seeds so i mean

1287
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,440
uh mendo purple does that you know where

1288
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,078
it's

1289
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,920
you know more green than purple even

1290
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:44,160
under cool temperatures and everything

1291
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,960
when it's full of seeds yeah you know so

1292
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,358
um but i think the plants have different

1293
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,800
uh processes when they're impregnated

1294
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,679
versus not

1295
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,839
right right you know

1296
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,598
they do they do very different things

1297
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:58,400
their their goal is different at the

1298
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,480
time

1299
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,920
and and i didn't even think about this

1300
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,920
but i'm i'm feeding seeded out plants

1301
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,159
you know nitrogen [ __ ] all the way

1302
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,079
through yeah yeah i'm not trying to cut

1303
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,879
off their nitro source you know early

1304
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,160
like it would a flower so yeah the goal

1305
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,559
is is healthy mature seeds not

1306
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,879
attractive flower

1307
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,960
exactly flower is just the carrier for

1308
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,960
the seed so it's very different it's a

1309
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,119
very different feeding regimen

1310
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,800
uh to get where you want to go yeah and

1311
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,559
flower

1312
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,359
which is why when you have a failed run

1313
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,480
and a bunch of flour and no seed

1314
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,480
that smoke ain't the best yeah right

1315
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,480
you already said maybe maybe i should

1316
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,480
mention something is that uh you know

1317
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,159
csi has actually you know he has some

1318
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,119
pictures of some of these old gardens

1319
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:49,598
and stuff like that um but unfortunately

1320
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,960
since it was all prohibitiony back then

1321
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,119
um they were on polaroids and uh you

1322
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,039
learn with polaroids that they fade over

1323
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,680
time

1324
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,838
you know so uh they become the the

1325
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:04,799
colors start to become washed out the

1326
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:07,679
edges start to become less distinct

1327
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,519
so you know he cataloged some of it and

1328
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,519
uh you know you can you can get a

1329
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,318
general idea but it's not the sharpest

1330
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,079
of picks right i i have thousands of

1331
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,719
these polaroids you know

1332
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,599
for you know the better part of a decade

1333
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:21,118
and

1334
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,760
now

1335
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,480
now they're uh

1336
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,480
not much to look at yeah that's a bummer

1337
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,079
dude that's such a buffer

1338
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,079
right right it's just something you

1339
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,039
didn't know at the time

1340
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:37,359
who knew that over 15 20 25 years

1341
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:40,239
polaroids would would fade

1342
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:42,480
right a regular picture developed at a

1343
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:45,039
you know you know old school style will

1344
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,838
stay good for a long time right

1345
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,960
polaroids don't you

1346
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,119
know should have scanned them all while

1347
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,039
i had the chance

1348
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,559
yeah i mean you know we all should have

1349
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,519
done things differently when we were

1350
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,160
younger

1351
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,440
uh yeah you know that's the common theme

1352
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,440
right right

1353
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,559
your camera's slowly but surely burning

1354
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,559
out bro

1355
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,480
well you know so the best thing is i was

1356
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,319
having i was having a conversation with

1357
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,960
with uh our buddy pip

1358
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,558
uh who is gonna drop some seeds soon and

1359
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,318
he might come on here and chat with matt

1360
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,000
and i but he didn't really want to show

1361
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,920
his face so i'm definitely going to show

1362
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,639
him this csi tech

1363
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,639
yeah right here

1364
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:25,199
because it's exactly what he's looking

1365
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,760
for

1366
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,598
a disembodied voice coming out of coming

1367
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,680
out of the darkness isn't that how they

1368
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,800
always used to do yeah right this is

1369
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,960
very 60 minutes in the 90s you know

1370
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,720
i just need to now i just need the voice

1371
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,720

1374
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:50,559
room okay so yeah

1375
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,800
the the the seeds that

1376
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,000
riot and i have available

1377
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,880
um

1378
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,559
are basically an open pollination

1379
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,400
uh from

1380
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:05,119
47 plants

1381
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:07,519
27 females 20 males just open pollinated

1382
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,400
and uh you know there was there was

1383
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:13,119
definitely good bad in the ugly in there

1384
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,280
there was one plant that was near

1385
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,160
identical to the northern light i grew

1386
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,960
you know from 94 on from my dad

1387
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,318
um smelled like it looked extremely

1388
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,199
similar to it

1389
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,679
you know all of that um

1390
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:30,159
and you know i i had a one of my good

1391
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,879
old old buddies from you know

1392
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,480
from that area you know uh

1393
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,640
you know check checking things out with

1394
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,318
me as it was progressing and he was like

1395
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,519
yeah that's that's just like the plant

1396
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:44,159
we we used to rock you know 25 years ago

1397
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,639
so that's wild that that's definitely a

1398
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,159
good sign um there was a lot of variety

1399
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,400
in there um

1400
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,480
one of my favorites of course uh was

1401
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,960
this one that was super frosty kind of a

1402
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,639
popcorn nugget thing a really good

1403
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,400
stretch um

1404
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,039
and it was kind of bubble gummy i that's

1405
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,880
how i ex you know describe it but

1406
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,239
i don't know maybe other people would

1407
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,480
you know

1408
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,399
just describe the smell different

1409
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,639
but it was really nice um and we're

1410
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,160
definitely saving that one and then the

1411
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,039
one that was

1412
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:15,118
um

1413
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,119
i just have it written down as stinky as

1414
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,318
[ __ ] but

1415
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,280
it it's

1416
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:21,519
it had

1417
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,559
like 10 different smells

1418
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:26,318
you know top middle bottom

1419
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,160
and i i can't describe that kind of

1420
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,838
stuff but you know there's there's guys

1421
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,679
with noses who are like oh yeah that's

1422
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,838
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you

1423
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:35,519
know and list 20 different smells on

1424
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,838
something but

1425
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,639
all i know is it smelled amazing too

1426
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,400
yeah and that one uh that one's

1427
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,000
definitely a keeper and then there are

1428
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,559
some other ones that

1429
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,639
you know ranged uh

1430
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,280
you know this way in that way

1431
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:53,039
and you know my my end up being keepers

1432
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,319
might not definitely going to give them

1433
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,639
a couple few

1434
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,639
runs to decide on which ones are going

1435
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,879
to kind of make the cut for future

1436
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:01,920
projects you know

1437
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,200
so

1438
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,159
that's what i'm stoked about is that we

1439
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,480
get to see them as clones not just see

1440
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,719
seed moms you know but as clones and

1441
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,760
they get clones of every single one it's

1442
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:15,439
it's pretty expansive and it was a it

1443
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,000
was a cool it was cool that

1444
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,079
and i know you know he he he credits me

1445
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,239
with getting the seats and stuff but it

1446
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,800
was it was really cool to be able to to

1447
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:27,838
look inside

1448
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,000
uh csi's mindset as he did these

1449
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:32,078
selections what he was looking for how

1450
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
he went about it how many clones he was

1451
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,480
keeping of each i learned a lot i

1452
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,559
learned a lot from dude during this so

1453
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,159
um he put in the work

1454
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,079
no matter what he says he put in the

1455
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:43,838
[ __ ] work on this stuff

1456
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,280
right

1457
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,279
yeah maybe and maybe i should add

1458
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,599
something in where caleb and i chat a

1459
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,040
bunch about like you know

1460
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,519
phenos he's found in seed lines before

1461
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,599
um that didn't survive like you know the

1462
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,119
the backup clone didn't survive and he

1463
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,599
lost it and he's like well you know i

1464
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,720
got x amount of these seeds i can find

1465
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,760
it again

1466
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:06,318
so

1467
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,359
uh maybe you know how excited were you

1468
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:11,440
dude to find something that was pretty

1469
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,679
close to the spitting image of your lost

1470
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,800
plant

1471
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,480
i i was stoked on it um

1472
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,800
but you know uh

1473
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,880
i was all honestly more excited with

1474
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,839
some of these other ones that you know

1475
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,559
because

1476
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:29,759
you know back in 94 your

1477
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,680
the the reality is you know um it's just

1478
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,839
a traded clone

1479
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,598
you have no idea you know where it came

1480
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:38,239
from how many speeds it got selected

1481
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,920
from you know anything about it you know

1482
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,078
and that's the thing with traded clones

1483
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,838
is you know it might be selected from

1484
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,519
one or four or

1485
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,759
ten or a hundred you know

1486
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:50,159
um i just like you know having the

1487
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,880
opportunity to actually select from

1488
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:55,279
better than one yeah for sure i think

1489
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,559
too that like there are things for all

1490
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,119
of us now that we're all older where

1491
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,119
some of the strains that you grow first

1492
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,119
and you build your first relationships

1493
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,119
with as a grower

1494
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,880
right in your mind because you're

1495
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,358
learning so much then

1496
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,200
and this is your kind bud plant

1497
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:14,719
right right you know and they really

1498
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,799
stick with you those

1499
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,159
and you know you think back like oh what

1500
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,079
could i have done

1501
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,239
uh with that plant when i actually had

1502
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,240
some some knowledge

1503
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,239
when i had that plant i was an idiot you

1504
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,399
know i was 19 or something and i didn't

1505
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:30,159
know jack and now i'm like you know what

1506
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,920
could i do if i had it now

1507
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:33,358
right right

1508
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,400
yeah yeah yeah

1509
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:36,159
yeah

1510
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,760
i'm a little interested too and i know

1511
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:39,679
this is an nl talk

1512
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,960
but are you do you want to talk about

1513
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,399
any of the pinks and perf stuff you're

1514
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,798
seeing too since that's a big project

1515
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,798
you have going on right now

1516
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:48,639
oh we could touch on it just a little

1517
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:49,920
bit yeah yeah

1518
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:51,358
you know uh

1519
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,079
had me amped

1520
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,960
yeah i'm definitely gonna uh

1521
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,640
you know

1522
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,720
try to post up a little bit more on that

1523
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,798
soon

1524
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:03,919
just because uh there's there's some

1525
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,119
interesting stuff in in there um

1526
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,720
and uh

1527
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,559
yeah that one keeper i was telling you

1528
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:12,399
about uh

1529
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:14,960
it smells better than 99 percent of

1530
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,160
weed i've come across so

1531
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,679
that's wild

1532
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,838
you know um

1533
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:22,318
definite it's not a purple pheno pure

1534
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:25,119
green you know no purple traits

1535
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:28,239
to it whatsoever but man the smell

1536
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:30,400
is just so overpowering uh

1537
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:32,318
i i think it could be a a passed around

1538
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,079
keeper as long as it's over five percent

1539
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:37,679
thc of course yeah for sure

1540
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,760
well you know we should mention that

1541
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,000
some of the terpius things

1542
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,680
tend to be lower thc

1543
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
right right there's a ratio there's a

1544
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:48,879
there's a there's a ratio there that's

1545
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,960
not fully understood but a lot of times

1546
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,358
things that are extremely human

1547
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,440
perception terpy

1548
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:57,519
don't tend to be the most potent there

1549
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,400
are things out there that have both

1550
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:02,318
but a lot of them don't so we'll see

1551
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,838
and uh

1552
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:05,838
have i told you

1553
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,000
much or anything about this uh

1554
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:10,558
this pinks and purple plant

1555
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,719
uh uh i i heard it through

1556
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,880
your comment you and matt chatted about

1557
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,879
it and he called me all excited yeah

1558
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,119
yeah because it's rare that you sound

1559
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,200
that excited yeah something that you

1560
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,079
found so he was i'd never hear him

1561
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,598
overstate anything about anything dude

1562
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,119
[ __ ] thousands of seeds so when he

1563
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,599
tells me dude

1564
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,440
like this is special like yeah i mean i

1565
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,160
think i think homie told me something

1566
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,119
like he he thinks it might be like the

1567
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:39,440
best pheno he's found

1568
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,640
which for some for someone like you to

1569
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,400
say who pops literally like thousands of

1570
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,078
seeds over a number of years and

1571
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,400
searches through them that's really

1572
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,760
something oh yeah you know

1573
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,760
and it really is

1574
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,640
i like to give to give credit to you

1575
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,400
know uh what what plants you know kind

1576
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,719
of produce these kind of things

1577
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,119
yeah and uh

1578
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:03,118
uh this particular plant you know it has

1579
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,200
mendo purple in its background but

1580
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:09,280
there's no purple traits to this plant

1581
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:10,798
at all but mendo purple has this strong

1582
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,920
uh mango

1583
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:17,199
um trait that pops up in the ones and

1584
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,240
this thing is that mango times a hundred

1585
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:19,679
you know

1586
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:22,558
it's it's just

1587
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,679
the strongest mango i've ever smelled

1588
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,920
wow

1589
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,279
you know as you know and a bunch more

1590
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,400
fruit too

1591
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,319
but uh

1592
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,400
you know i i know it gets that mango you

1593
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,719
know at least you know a portion of it

1594
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,039
from from the mendo perps

1595
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,239
so you know

1596
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:40,400
could be cool

1597
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:42,798
as long as i don't lose the clone

1598
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,200
ganja boners yeah i mean one one of the

1599
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:47,280
things that the mendo p certainly has is

1600
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:50,078
it's got pretty wide genetic diversity

1601
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,240
so there's a lot of terps in there

1602
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,318
right right and so then you throw it on

1603
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,239
something else that's also terpene maybe

1604
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:58,159
wide and you can get

1605
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,759
these unusual things that have a

1606
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:01,358
potential to pop up

1607
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,440
right i mean that's kind of like people

1608
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:05,679
should know this too and maybe i should

1609
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,119
say it right now where it's like if you

1610
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:12,719
cross something to like that uh you know

1611
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:14,880
to but to i don't know to deep chunk

1612
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,318
you're going to get a lot of deep chunk

1613
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,400
right and it's going to be really

1614
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,159
consistent you know and there's certain

1615
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,559
things you throw certain things on

1616
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,719
cookies and it looks very cooky

1617
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,280
right and so people get frustrated when

1618
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,798
you cross two very wide things because

1619
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,240
you can get a bunch of junk and you can

1620
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,119
get a bunch of this and that and it's

1621
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,719
all like unpredictable oh yeah but then

1622
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,559
every once in a while amongst all that

1623
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,399
stuff there's this gem

1624
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,240
because it's so wide and unpredictable

1625
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,838
and you're like oh whoa

1626
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,919
what is that thing

1627
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,000
right right so sometimes the frustration

1628
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,639
and the effort pays off

1629
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,679
because a really wide base of things to

1630
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,318
look through

1631
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:54,078
and maybe i should say this too is when

1632
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:55,759
you know when caleb was referencing when

1633
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,280
he did the open pollination that there

1634
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,559
was some gems

1635
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,400
some mids some junk

1636
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,119
that's 90s wheat

1637
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,039
if you have a wide genetic base

1638
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:11,440
you're going to get

1639
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:14,400
amazing midzie junk for all in combo and

1640
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,039
also uh on that pinks and perps one uh

1641
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,400
you know i i was i was i always forget

1642
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:19,838
this but

1643
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,200
um

1644
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:25,838
i i grew up when i i made those and

1645
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:28,318
found that one i was growing out 180 of

1646
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:30,480
those things so there was only one like

1647
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:32,719
it out of 180

1648
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,599
yeah you know so i wonder how it's going

1649
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,959
to breed because it was such a outlier

1650
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,039
right

1651
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,880
were there other other phenos that were

1652
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:43,199
more consistent and like popping up more

1653
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,838
often oh yeah the the

1654
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:49,439
the purple ones were predominant you

1655
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:52,159
know to find an actual green one in in

1656
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,480
this hybrid was actually the rarity you

1657
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:57,199
know most most everything was you know

1658
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,039
some form of light pink or lavender you

1659
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,558
know all the way through you know purple

1660
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:03,119
to almost black

1661
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:05,119
yeah you know but uh yeah the the green

1662
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,280
ones were were rare

1663
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,280
you know and and i i probably kept out

1664
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,200
of the 180 i probably kept about 20 or

1665
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,920
so of the

1666
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:16,879
of the darker purple ones and just the

1667
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,440
real terpier ones the you know

1668
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,480
but they're all i don't think i i have

1669
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,798
any other uh green ones out of the whole

1670
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,240
all all the purples and the blacks

1671
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:28,480
that's wild man

1672
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,479
yeah that it was so consistently that

1673
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,519
and then this one pops up

1674
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,159
right

1675
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,759
so and so maybe i should throw this out

1676
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:37,679
there just real quick before we totally

1677
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,520
lose the thread on it is

1678
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,838
on some of these ones that you found

1679
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:43,599
that that the one that's super frosty

1680
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,199
and smells to you like bubble gum and

1681
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,079
the one that kind of reminds you

1682
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,960
strongly of your dad dad's dad's nl and

1683
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,280
such

1684
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,440
um you're probably planning on doing

1685
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,760
some more breeding with those select

1686
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,838
females correct oh yeah i'm already

1687
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,920
working on that too uh

1688
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:04,000
so the the first round of course was the

1689
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:06,079
open pollination and now um i have a

1690
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,039
room that's a couple few weeks into

1691
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,839
flower

1692
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:11,199
and

1693
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:13,358
that's all the keeper females and my

1694
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,480
keeper male my favorite male out of the

1695
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:15,440
whole bunch

1696
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,760
which is

1697
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,039
um i don't know it's it's like almost a

1698
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:24,480
milk chocolatey smelling male and he's

1699
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:28,159
super pungent and he almost looks like a

1700
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,000
bigger uh version of purple indica

1701
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:32,000
you know

1702
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,079
that's a throwback from the same you

1703
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,679
know washington areas these seeds came

1704
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,480
from you know

1705
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:37,679
so

1706
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,559
you know there's there's something to

1707
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:40,639
that

1708
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,119
and uh like i've told uh

1709
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,879
um told matt i'm not sure if i i told

1710
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,000
you not so but uh

1711
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,960
um

1712
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,440
when

1713
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,838
the the northern lights i used to have

1714
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,838
um you know occasionally i throw a a

1715
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:57,038
late nano or whatever whatever

1716
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,838
and i grew out a bunch of s1 seeds

1717
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,920
well

1718
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:02,318
i gave you know some of these s ones to

1719
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,680
my buddy you know uh clones of the s

1720
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,279
ones anyway

1721
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,279
and uh

1722
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,559
um he uh

1723
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,839
accidentally crossed it to train wreck

1724
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,160
and

1725
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:16,719
when that stuff was grown out it had

1726
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,879
that same chocolatiness that i'm

1727
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:21,439
smelling in this thing you know when

1728
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,079
grown outdoors so

1729
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,440
i don't know if it's just coincidence or

1730
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,559
or what but

1731
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,798
you know

1732
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,519
it it could just be

1733
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:34,480
same same similar genetics the power of

1734
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:36,639
accidents

1735
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,639
the power of accident so maybe i should

1736
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:39,519
throw this in there too so

1737
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:42,078
if

1738
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:43,759
with with the these seeds that uh matt

1739
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,960
and caleb are offering up this open

1740
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,799
pollination

1741
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,679
uh what that's going to give you

1742
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:49,199
is

1743
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,759
you know that's going to give you your

1744
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:54,000
own ability to hunt through the line and

1745
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,480
it's going to be very wide

1746
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,318
you know but you could find gems just

1747
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,000
like he found yeah

1748
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:02,239
uh you could you could absolutely

1749
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,920
perhaps find one you wouldn't know that

1750
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:05,519
look you know there could be bubble gum

1751
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,599
smelling ones there could be this ones

1752
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:09,519
there could be there's a reasonably good

1753
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:11,519
chance that somewhere in there is those

1754
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,480
phenols pop up again

1755
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:14,639
and then

1756
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,880
give them x amount of months to do some

1757
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:19,519
more breeding and we'll get the chance

1758
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,559
to see if some of these selected females

1759
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,798
breed true for the traits that he liked

1760
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,559
because those will be on offer too so

1761
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:28,639
that's kind of like for people that

1762
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,960
don't know that's kind of like when you

1763
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,279
get old seeds or seeds that you want to

1764
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,679
preserve one of the best things to do to

1765
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,160
keep the genetic diversity of the line

1766
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,000
is just to open pollinate everything

1767
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,038
right and then

1768
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,039
you know you can set aside you know some

1769
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,880
seeds from selected phenos and you can

1770
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,440
keep certain phenoes and start breeding

1771
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,280
with them and intentionally

1772
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,798
and seeing where it takes you

1773
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,798
so that's kind of like the that's one of

1774
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:55,838
the processes of

1775
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:57,519
um

1776
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,279
taking old seeds and trying to both

1777
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,159
preserve the line but then take it in

1778
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,160
certain directions

1779
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,118
that's kind of how i and you've done

1780
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:08,798
that a number of times with like various

1781
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,920
heirloom strains that you've come across

1782
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:13,119
you know

1783
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,798
always open pollinate step one and then

1784
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:17,039
you know you can do whatever you want

1785
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:18,798
past that you know directional this way

1786
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,079
that way or the other

1787
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:21,599
you know and

1788
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,280
everybody else can too as long as you

1789
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,880
know you share the seed

1790
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,200
all that you know

1791
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,880
yeah

1792
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:31,038
are there any other projects you're

1793
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,640
super stoked about past that like any

1794
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,720
femme projects coming up that you're

1795
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:38,078
you're you're pumped about

1796
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:40,798
ooh i got that patient zero common

1797
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:42,960
patient zero is on its way

1798
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,798
uh i don't know that that one's gonna be

1799
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,798
interesting um

1800
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,719
i'm not sure how that was gonna turn out

1801
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:50,719
but you know we'll see

1802
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:52,318
it could be cool maybe you could explain

1803
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,480
for people because you have so many

1804
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:57,119
names uh because you're so prolific

1805
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,639
about things what is patient zero no

1806
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,160
patience zero is a

1807
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:03,038
you know uh

1808
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,679
um basically it's the just the urkel

1809
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:08,000
across the pakistanis to troll kush and

1810
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:11,679
i grew up a hundred and something of

1811
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,559
those years ago and my absolute favorite

1812
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,639
planet

1813
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:17,200
uh that one was a

1814
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:18,078
was was the one i named patient zero

1815
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:20,000
um

1816
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,760
and you know it's it's kind of

1817
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,798
as long as you like a little tropinoline

1818
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,799
on your diet it's pretty all right

1819
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:29,038
and so maybe i'll add that to it too

1820
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,719
where it's like a lot of modern breeding

1821
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,039
today is

1822
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,558
one-offs where people hybridize

1823
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,480
something and then just toss it out to

1824
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,400
the public um

1825
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,880
what he just described is what's known

1826
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,440
as like multi-stage breeding

1827
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,680
where he made a cross he grew out a

1828
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,960
bunch of phenos he picked one that he

1829
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:51,118
liked and now he's doing further work

1830
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,358
with that pheno itself

1831
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,440
probably crossing it to itself

1832
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:57,679
and crossing it to other

1833
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,079
uh cuttings that he has in the stable

1834
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,199
that he thinks might blend well with it

1835
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,440
right

1836
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,000
um one of my favorites i actually have

1837
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,440
uh flowering right now um

1838
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,400
is uh

1839
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,760
the mendo purple number 54 selection

1840
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,160
from you know growing out that last

1841
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,559
hundred and something of those

1842
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:19,519
the urkel 103

1843
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:22,880
you know s1 and then you know those you

1844
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:26,719
know um i reversed the 103 slapped on

1845
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:29,119
the mendo man those are uniform i mean

1846
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:30,318
as uniform as you can get really yeah

1847
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,640
that's cool

1848
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:36,159
interestingly uh the mendo is extremely

1849
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:38,639
dominant on it uh really yeah they're

1850
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,679
all they look more like mendo purple

1851
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:40,639
plants

1852
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:43,358
then

1853
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:45,118
you can barely see any urkel to them and

1854
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:46,798
the both of those selections were made

1855
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,280
out of that room that i came and visited

1856
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:51,679
you and saw before you uh

1857
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,400
the s1s of urkel and the s1's and mendo

1858
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,318
p

1859
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,280
yeah yeah yeah yep

1860
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:58,798
but uh

1861
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,519
yeah yeah

1862
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:02,719
um definitely interesting though

1863
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:03,838
um

1864
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,078
i don't know

1865
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,119
yeah i was excited too like about i

1866
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,599
don't know if you want to talk about any

1867
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,200
of the purple punch stuff or if that's

1868
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,720
you know what i mean like the

1869
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:16,719
the findings in that you're kind of

1870
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:17,759
saying that are unique yeah yeah um

1871
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:19,439
the

1872
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,839
we we've talked and the most surprising

1873
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,798
thing about breeding with purple punch

1874
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:25,599
is

1875
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:26,880
how [ __ ] stable it is i mean mentally

1876
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:28,880
right

1877
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,240
when you're working with you know it

1878
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:35,358
doesn't matter what you know ogs diesels

1879
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:37,279
chem dogs girl scouts you know

1880
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,440
and then all the popular stuff based off

1881
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,359
all those yeah you're gonna find a nice

1882
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,599
portion of you know

1883
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:45,759
hermaphrodism you know

1884
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,000
more so if you know

1885
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,319
your your environment's not a you know

1886
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,838
perfect but you know even if you have a

1887
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:54,400
perfect environment there's always going

1888
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:56,558
to be a percentage of those

1889
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,280
but the purple punches

1890
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:02,160
have almost the lowest

1891
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,960
uh levels of hermaphroditism i've seen

1892
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,480
in

1893
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,920
any hybrids

1894
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,920
so

1895
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,920
i mean that's that's useful that's

1896
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,039
something people look for and i think

1897
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,760
like the fact that it popped up in an og

1898
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,159
gdp was kind of shocking you know

1899
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:20,719
yeah yeah

1900
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:22,479
and you know i i was i was the

1901
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:24,399
i wasn't a huge fan of purple punch i

1902
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:26,718
didn't even you know start growing until

1903
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,639
a couple years ago you know

1904
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,239
i i kind of ignored it and was like i

1905
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,798
got plenty of my own oracle hybrids i

1906
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:34,718
don't need another one yeah but uh you

1907
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:35,759
know it has traits that it put puts

1908
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,838
forward and

1909
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,838
you really can't argue with it you know

1910
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:41,439
yeah that was the same way you know we

1911
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:44,318
both just kind of dodged hype for a

1912
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:46,479
while with like the [ __ ] the the

1913
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,839
gorilla glue and that and then end up at

1914
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,519
the end like [ __ ] that shit's kind of

1915
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:51,198
good there right

1916
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,679
last one to the party that's an

1917
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:55,119
interesting that's an interesting aspect

1918
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,239
that people maybe should hear about is

1919
01:08:55,119 --> 01:09:00,479
sometimes you can have an amazing cut

1920
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,318
that checks a bunch of boxes

1921
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,559
and it breeds like [ __ ]

1922
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,520
right it's all over the place it throws

1923
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,679
a bunch of junk and it yeah the quality

1924
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,359
inherent in the cut itself

1925
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,679
doesn't seem to translate to its

1926
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:16,079
children very well and then other times

1927
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,759
you can take something like purple punch

1928
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:19,759
that they're just talking about that has

1929
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,198
a lot of nice traits but kind of lacks

1930
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,960
high or whatever else and you don't

1931
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,198
think that much of it

1932
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,600
and then you cross it to things and its

1933
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:29,599
children come out incredibly amazing

1934
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,560
with a bunch of traits that you like

1935
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:36,079
right so sometimes a breeding parent can

1936
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,640
actually be kind of a crappy

1937
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:42,318
crappy plant in some ways like

1938
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,520
uh caleb likes a lot of the s ones of my

1939
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,560
mendo p

1940
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,600
quite a bit more than the mama

1941
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,199
oh yeah

1942
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:52,000
you know the mama is amazing for

1943
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:54,079
breeding but as an actual plant itself

1944
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,439
there's some aspects to it that are

1945
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:59,679
unpredictable and and it's low thc

1946
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:01,279
right right um but some of its children

1947
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,719
and some of the things that it throws

1948
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:04,158
and when you breed

1949
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,679
um and sometimes you might take

1950
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:07,119
something like purple punch that people

1951
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:10,079
make fun of and you breed with it and

1952
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:12,479
you're like wow this thing is amazing

1953
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,000
it throws all these traits consistently

1954
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,198
that are useful

1955
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,198
right

1956
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:19,198
i mean like you could talk for a minute

1957
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:22,319
about how stable

1958
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:23,919
that bubble gum cut you have is

1959
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:26,559
why you use it in so many different

1960
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,199
things because it throws like rock you

1961
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,760
know it it doesn't rot very easily it's

1962
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:33,439
got incredible structure it densens

1963
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,800
things up right

1964
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:37,279
right right

1965
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,679
well i don't know about

1966
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:42,000
it's really not the densest cut out

1967
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:45,039
there but it's it's uh

1968
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,158
it's definitely a um

1969
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:50,719
you know as as rot resistant as you can

1970
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:53,359
you can get a plant you know

1971
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:55,840
um on on my worst year you're ever

1972
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:59,119
outdoors i think i was aiming for like

1973
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,520
700 pounds or something and

1974
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:02,880
then we had six inches of rain the last

1975
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,120
week of september

1976
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,319
you know first week of october and i

1977
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,599
lost 50 to 60 percent of that garden to

1978
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:11,599
mold

1979
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,600
and the only thing that came through

1980
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,520
that garden with probably less than one

1981
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:19,360
percent rot ratio

1982
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:21,440
was that bubble gum cut yeah

1983
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,519
you know

1984
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:25,519
so you know tons of people are like you

1985
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,600
know what's your best you know

1986
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,400
mold resistant you know blah blah blah

1987
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,719
well

1988
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:33,119
right there you know

1989
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,679
so that outdoor queen

1990
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,679
yeah so someone sometimes those traits

1991
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,560
like they were just talking about like

1992
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,319
you know

1993
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,719
caleb does an enormous amount of

1994
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,639
breeding so for him to say

1995
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:48,079
that the purple punch is some of the

1996
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,560
most non-intersex stable thing he's ever

1997
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:52,238
worked with is saying something

1998
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,800
right you know when he says that like

1999
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:56,799
this plant is almost immune to mold and

2000
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,840
it's the most mold resistant plant i've

2001
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,159
ever seen

2002
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,079
and it passes that trait to some progeny

2003
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:03,839
that's useful information

2004
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,439
right yeah

2005
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,760
i see a lot of people commenting on the

2006
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:12,079
purple punch strength and like when

2007
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,079
breeding has changed um from where it

2008
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:16,158
was maybe 10 years ago on what we would

2009
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,158
select for potency-wise what we wouldn't

2010
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:21,198
use what we would use certain one of us

2011
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,799
you know um purple punch all i'd ever

2012
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:24,079
heard about was how weak it was so i

2013
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,520
just never

2014
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:30,079
i never got into it however

2015
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,480
it is a is a very extract

2016
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:34,880
centric community now

2017
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:38,079
and with extracts pretty much

2018
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:40,000
everything's [ __ ] strong um so so a

2019
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:41,519
lot of things are are more chirp-based

2020
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,679
now where people are are checking out

2021
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:47,199
what kind of terps are being passed how

2022
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,880
they breed and uh yeah i mean

2023
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:50,559
some people won't want to won't want to

2024
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,880
[ __ ] with anything that doesn't lay them

2025
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,320
out me i i like all kinds of ranges of

2026
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,480
different highs and i don't like being

2027
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:58,158
laid out so for me purple punch is

2028
01:12:56,479 --> 01:12:59,519
[ __ ] perfect

2029
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:01,119
oh yes

2030
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,280
yeah

2031
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,719
you know weed weed affects humans in

2032
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,800
different ways

2033
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:09,119
some of my favorite strains to smoke on

2034
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,560
a regular basis the other two guys that

2035
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,000
were checking that you know they don't

2036
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,800
like it that much

2037
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,399
they agree it's it's a super quality cut

2038
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,159
but it's not something with their body

2039
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,960
chemistry that really adapts all that

2040
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,960
well yeah i have friends that only like

2041
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,880
incredibly potent indicas because they

2042
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,119
want to be hammered down

2043
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,920
and a sativa makes them crawl up the

2044
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:29,840
wall

2045
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,239
yeah i have other friends that smoke a

2046
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,679
sativa and they relax

2047
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:35,919
right that would be me

2048
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:38,560
so yeah so cannabis and cannabis and

2049
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,920
individual strains uh don't think that

2050
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,760
the way it affects you is the way it

2051
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,440
affects everyone

2052
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,039
there's a range there

2053
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,039
yeah

2054
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:48,319
that's why i like keeping so many

2055
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:51,279
different you know

2056
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:53,519
cultivars because you know i i like a

2057
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:55,679
whole spectrum of different things and i

2058
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,679
know other people too you know like

2059
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:59,359
different things so you can't always

2060
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,119
breed for yourself

2061
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:04,719
definitely not

2062
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:07,119
does the does the purple punch reverse

2063
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:09,520
uh yeah yeah it reverses fine

2064
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:12,399
interesting so it reverses easily but

2065
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:15,199
won't ever throw intersex traits

2066
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:18,319
yeah yeah that was kind of odd in itself

2067
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:20,479
right the the s1 i got grown now i don't

2068
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:23,359
think i found a single ball

2069
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:25,759
or or or a manner on any of them

2070
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,639
yeah which is almost unheard of oh yeah

2071
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,320
yeah

2072
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,600
you're usually going to get at least 10

2073
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:33,840
to 20 percent you know and i i say 10 to

2074
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,600
20 and that could just be one ball down

2075
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,840
low or one you know

2076
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,840
a late man or something but there's

2077
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,640
always going to be like 10 to 20 percent

2078
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:46,000
yeah

2079
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:47,039
and then there's certain things that um

2080
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,119
herm

2081
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:51,439
but reverse

2082
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:52,800
right right you know i mean we've talked

2083
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,039
before about we're not going to get into

2084
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,640
it too much but you know they uh you

2085
01:14:55,039 --> 01:15:01,119
know the old sour cuts are famous for

2086
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:03,440
not reversing oh yeah

2087
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:05,599
or getting a handful of seed but they're

2088
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:08,000
also famous for the wrong conditions and

2089
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,679
they they throw manners that can see i

2090
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,079
create seed in your room for flower

2091
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,600
production yeah it's really easy to grow

2092
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:17,519
it buffy

2093
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:20,560
i had a add some sour some sourdes in a

2094
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,800
in a fully seeded room just recently

2095
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,800
and

2096
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:28,000
you know completely full of seed and

2097
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,800
about week four it just starts balling

2098
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,760
up just hanging all kinds of sour diesel

2099
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,440
balls

2100
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,840
even though it's fully seeded so the

2101
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:38,238
whole room was completely seated so it

2102
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:40,400
didn't have any risk of pollinating

2103
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:41,599
anything but you know it still felt the

2104
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:44,079
need to you know

2105
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,840
throw out just a ton of balls

2106
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:47,760
like what are you doing with those you

2107
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,600
know

2108
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,880
i didn't see any pollen off of them but

2109
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,679
you know

2110
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,560
yeah

2111
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:56,319
yeah i mean the you know the um the the

2112
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,320
what i consider to be the original but

2113
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:59,119
you know it's the one i got the chem d

2114
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:01,759
cut

2115
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:04,158
uh is pretty famous for throwing a bunch

2116
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,560
of nanners at week three four

2117
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:08,158
uh but they're sterile

2118
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,159
you know they don't really they don't

2119
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:12,079
really uh you know uh

2120
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:15,039
they don't they don't really make seed

2121
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:17,359
yeah and that kim d or just chem d's in

2122
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:19,519
general it seems yeah they they throw

2123
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:20,960
bananas like they're going out of style

2124
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,880
yeah

2125
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,719
and it's a trait that goes there and so

2126
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,960
i've had any number of friends or

2127
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:29,600
helpers or whatever on a light depth

2128
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,000
greenhouse come to me panicked

2129
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,600
because half the greenhouse has bananas

2130
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,679
popping out all over

2131
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,920
right i'm like oh calm down calm down

2132
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:40,000
it's it's the d we're gonna be fine

2133
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,279
you know and we're fine you know you can

2134
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,238
find a bean

2135
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:43,920
yeah

2136
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:44,959
but you know you do that with cherry pie

2137
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,158
or something and you have beans

2138
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,119
everywhere

2139
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:51,119
right

2140
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:52,800
so certain things certain things are

2141
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:54,479
different different risky you know

2142
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,719
there's different levels of risk

2143
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:58,559
yeah yeah yeah very so i mean maybe we

2144
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,239
should maybe we should chat about this

2145
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,199
maybe we should reel it back in for a

2146
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:03,198
second

2147
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:06,479
um part of the reason why we did this

2148
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:08,319
nl5 chat uh both starting in the 80s and

2149
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:10,559
going through some of the history and

2150
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:12,880
then bringing caleb on was to talk about

2151
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,920
the project that that him and matt have

2152
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,440
going

2153
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,279
and uh

2154
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,639
they they just dropped the seeds i

2155
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:20,800
believe

2156
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,920
yes or were about to or just did no no

2157
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,760
they're dropped

2158
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:27,920
caleb's caleb's site is humble

2159
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:29,520
csi.com correct caleb yeah that you

2160
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,600
could buy them on there or on right

2161
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,920
seedco.com

2162
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:37,199
yeah and so it's a it's a it's a

2163
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:40,319
riot and uh and caleb collab

2164
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:41,919
um and it's a big open pollination of

2165
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:44,319
genetics from

2166
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,359
um one of the people that was intimately

2167
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:49,759
involved in the old nl crew

2168
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:51,839
uh so the the provenance is excellent as

2169
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,320
far as like who it comes from

2170
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,239
um and you know but then on top of that

2171
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:59,599
too the proof is in the pudding

2172
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:01,919
so you know um it uh

2173
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,360
it's a chance for people to maybe hunt

2174
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,520
around if you have if you're a little

2175
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:06,719
adventurous and look through something

2176
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,560
old

2177
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,520
and something famous

2178
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,159
you know

2179
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,080
uh and you know caleb found a few things

2180
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:17,679
in it that he was super excited about

2181
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:19,519
and so hopefully you you guys will too

2182
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:21,760
uh and one of the ways

2183
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,840
that we're gonna make sure

2184
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:27,199
that not everything is skittles og

2185
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,319
cookie cushman's

2186
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:31,119
whatever

2187
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,960
is by people taking effort and reviving

2188
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:35,279
some of these old things and making

2189
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,399
fresh bats batches of seed that are more

2190
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:37,759
viable

2191
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:38,879
and then getting them into people's

2192
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,199
hands

2193
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,000
so the gene pool stays wider

2194
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:45,759
yeah yeah so not only is it a cool old

2195
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,880
project to something that's extremely

2196
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,520
famous

2197
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:52,079
uh and there's potential in it

2198
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:54,719
but you can better believe that most

2199
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:56,880
modern breeding with a few exceptions is

2200
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,640
the same 30 or 40 cuts blended in a

2201
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,840
bunch of different ways of the last 10

2202
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,159
years

2203
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,880
and this harkens back to a much older

2204
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:07,119
time so there's a possibility there that

2205
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,719
when you out cross things to something

2206
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:10,880
that aren't like each other if you take

2207
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,399
these nl5s and you start throwing it on

2208
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,719
different stuff you have

2209
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:16,960
you might get some unusual stuff you're

2210
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:18,480
not expecting that's good

2211
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,158
right

2212
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:22,158
you know spring's [ __ ] with me sorry

2213
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:23,920
guys no it's like because that's because

2214
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,079
that's the thing is a lot of breeders

2215
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,079
say that like sometimes you know

2216
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:29,519
crossing two very distinct things

2217
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,238
together

2218
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,920
is where you really get quality pop

2219
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:35,678
yeah

2220
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,000
you know and you're certainly

2221
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,719
introducing something older in the gene

2222
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,520
pool that was very common 20 30 years

2223
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,960
ago but now is many generations in her

2224
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,520
bread

2225
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,960
and so uh by these guys doing this

2226
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,640
project where it's kind of getting

2227
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,359
thrown out there again where it can get

2228
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,440
bred into a lot of modern stuff

2229
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:56,639
and people get to see what happens so

2230
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,279
you know you'll you'll get more

2231
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,400
opportunities to see what csi is doing

2232
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:02,800
with the work

2233
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:04,879
uh in future breeding projects that seem

2234
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,360
like they're already engaged

2235
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,199
um and hopefully people are going to buy

2236
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:11,920
a bunch of this stuff and start posting

2237
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:13,359
and trying them out themselves

2238
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,279
and it's one of the ways you can keep

2239
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:17,119
cannabis history alive

2240
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:19,439
right and making the words with the

2241
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:21,039
stuff yeah yeah

2242
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:22,719
you know mixing it with modern things

2243
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:24,399
and seeing what happens

2244
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,279
right right

2245
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:27,599
so

2246
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:29,039
what do you guys think would be the

2247
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,440
best

2248
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:34,560
you know available

2249
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:38,719
uh plant line whatever

2250
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,719
out there to cross to the nl5s

2251
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:43,119
you know

2252
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,119
i i personally i want to see the hogs

2253
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:47,039
breath in all five i think that would be

2254
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,119
cool if if we could track that down and

2255
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:50,560
do that again it's been out of my hands

2256
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:54,000
for a while but i think that would be

2257
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,000
interesting just because of the terms

2258
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,399
how about you not so

2259
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:02,159
you know i actually think that um

2260
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:03,920
it might cross well with something like

2261
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:05,759
the dog [ __ ]

2262
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,880
um okay okay

2263
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,960
you know

2264
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,600
kind of a potentially almost a back

2265
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:14,079
cross potentially almost i mean a back

2266
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,320
cross has to use the the technically the

2267
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:19,679
same cut to go back to but

2268
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:21,439
maybe something that is very nl

2269
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,920
uh because one thing i'll say about that

2270
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:26,158
dog [ __ ] grown indoor is boy does it

2271
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:29,760
look like 90s weed

2272
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:32,799
like lime green with bright orange hairs

2273
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,719
and it just has that like nl type of

2274
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,119
like like look

2275
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,880
i was going to say hydro but uh caleb is

2276
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,319
purely organic so i don't want to insult

2277
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,600
him it's just that like

2278
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:45,359
that like big sack of hydro nl that you

2279
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,840
would get you know that's just super

2280
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:49,920
frosty and stuff like that and so

2281
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,920
um you know but it might give it some

2282
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,399
stretch and some vigor and it might kind

2283
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,760
of like and that's kind of like what i

2284
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,158
like one of the things that i get

2285
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,920
interested about is crossing

2286
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:02,559
two different things that you think have

2287
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,239
similar parentage behind them

2288
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,000
yes and then you see if you get some

2289
01:22:04,238 --> 01:22:08,158
throwbacks

2290
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,639
because both parents have it

2291
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:14,559
yeah i i do have the dog [ __ ]

2292
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:16,480
in uh my my latest round uh

2293
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:20,719
so you know but it it's it's getting

2294
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:22,959
across to that that chocolaty um

2295
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:25,760
nl5 male and

2296
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:28,399
honestly uh i think there were better

2297
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:32,400
uh there were males that

2298
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:34,079
kind of looked more similar to dog [ __ ]

2299
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:35,759
but uh

2300
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,000
um i you know

2301
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,039
i i didn't use them personally for this

2302
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,319
round

2303
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:42,158
um

2304
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:44,000
because i liked that you know particular

2305
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:45,039
you know chocolaty one and if i was

2306
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,960
going to throw out one more

2307
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:48,000
recommendation and combine the old with

2308
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,399
the new

2309
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,800
um one of neville's most classic

2310
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:55,519
combinations was uh nl5 and skunk

2311
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,960
and

2312
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,360
i kind of view

2313
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,600
uh the diesel family as

2314
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:03,039
cert what we have is surviving modern

2315
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,719
skunk

2316
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:06,639
not that there's not cheese and a couple

2317
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:09,600
other things like that but

2318
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:10,800
i kind of view like sours as american

2319
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,719
skunk

2320
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,639
right or very very skunkish so it would

2321
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,639
be kind of cool to see

2322
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:19,920
like what we have now is skunk and what

2323
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:22,079
we have now is nl blended back together

2324
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,719
right um because that was one of the

2325
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:27,760
most classic best-selling and they

2326
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,760
combined super well

2327
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:32,000
yeah

2328
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:33,519
i definitely have cheese in there too so

2329
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,079
you know

2330
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,840
you know at least junk one are you

2331
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,198
talking skunk one or

2332
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,800
skunk

2333
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:42,719
i mean i that's

2334
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,560
cheese is fine that's obviously pure

2335
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:47,039
skunk one that's really old i was just

2336
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,400
thinking of certain diesels just because

2337
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:51,039
i consider

2338
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,319
i consider certain diesels uh modern

2339
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:55,600
that to me that even though it doesn't

2340
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:59,198
have the name i consider a diesel to be

2341
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:02,000
like a skunk skunk skunk oi type plant

2342
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:04,158
right right it's tall it's rangy you

2343
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,960
know it's it's got that kind of skunk

2344
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:09,519
type growth to it it's got these very i

2345
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:12,399
basically think of like gas and diesel

2346
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:15,199
as it's not like roadkill but it is on

2347
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:17,198
that skunk spectrum

2348
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:18,238
it's like different angles of the same

2349
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:20,238
terps

2350
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:21,519
yeah you know yeah it's kind of how i

2351
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:22,638
see it so

2352
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,080
you know

2353
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,600
um

2354
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:27,920
but yeah and then the other thing too is

2355
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,280
that you know you know you cross it to

2356
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,760
things you hope

2357
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:33,359
are gonna cross well and then you cross

2358
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,119
it to some things that are just random

2359
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,279
and sometimes those random ones end up

2360
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,559
being the best ones because you really

2361
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:40,319
don't know and you really don't know

2362
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,760
what genes are gonna pop

2363
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:44,559
right right right and you really don't

2364
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,239
know what recessives are in there true

2365
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,440
true right like so to take it back to

2366
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:49,839
humans

2367
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:51,919
unless both parents have the gene you

2368
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,440
can't have kids with blue eyes or green

2369
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,679
eyes

2370
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:57,198
you know you if if one parent has the

2371
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,119
recessive the other parent has the

2372
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:01,198
dominant it won't combine

2373
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:02,719
right blonde hair is the same way both

2374
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:04,719
parents have to have the blonde hair

2375
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,079
gene or the red hair gene or it won't

2376
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,158
pop

2377
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:10,960
and so sometimes if you take two things

2378
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:12,960
that you think might have similar genes

2379
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,639
you might get some recessives that pop

2380
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,920
and all of a sudden something unusual

2381
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,119
comes out

2382
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,600
you know

2383
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:21,840
yeah yeah so

2384
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,239
yeah well i promise to to

2385
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:27,360
not hold caleb too long i know he's got

2386
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:28,959

2387
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:29,839

of their individual websites

2427
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:56,800
um they were communicating a bunch

2428
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,719
during the during the grow they were

2429
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,800
talking about what he was seeing

2430
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:04,399

projects get made today is with uh uh

2434
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:13,039
people that have similar interests

2435
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,199
collaborating and making it work

2436
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:16,479

it would be great

2438
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:20,000
uh and it would spread out some old

2439
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:21,599
genetics and it would keep them alive

2440
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,158
and you could do your little part to

2441
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,480
make sure that the gene pool stays wider

2442
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:27,359
and hopefully find some fire

2443
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:28,319
yeah

2444
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:30,158
