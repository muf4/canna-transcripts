00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,299
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,039
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,839
cannabis strain history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,000
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,440
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,359
subculture

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,080
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,639
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,379
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,079
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,280
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
to the underground

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,520
welcome to breeder Syndicate I'm Matthew

19
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,839
and I'm here with my host thousand fold

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,379
and today we're going to be talking

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,539
about making seeds in small spaces and

22
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,738
home environments

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,620
yeah

24
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,599
um so in the past uh Matt you and not so

25
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,698
I think have tended to focus on

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,679
commercial breeding and the conditions

27
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,299
of the breeding industry and while

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,978
certainly tips and techniques have been

29
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,319
shared like you guys have pivoted them

30
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,519
you know amongst you anecdotes and

31
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,679
responses

32
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,140
I think it's a definitely a good time to

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,520
have an episode dedicated to

34
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,099
practicalities of seed making and

35
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,219
reading a little bit especially for the

36
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,438
people at home or in smaller spaces

37
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,140
yeah a lot of a lot of what we've done

38
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,478
is more specific to people that have

39
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,280
already like maybe memorized marijuana

40
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,560
botany you know like it's already

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,680
already more advanced what we talk about

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,879
in the the techniques and specifics so a

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,860
lot of people have talked about like

44
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,158
they would like something more basic

45
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,438
just a a quick intro on just seed making

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,000
in general a lot of the basics have been

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,500
totally skipped over left out and

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,640
there's not really anyone covering them

49
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,180
or in one spot so yeah

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,180
yeah this will be fun yeah

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,380
without further Ado I think we can jump

52
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,920
in

53
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:03,539
making seeds with regular plants and I

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,040
think the first distinction I wanted to

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,600
make was

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,099
you know obviously before you get into

57
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,978
something like this there's a little bit

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:14,519
of time planning involved because there

59
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,920
are timing constraints absolutely

60
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,719
so for some people

61
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:24,659
it's about lining up their males and

62
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,520
females so that they're both ready at

63
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,378
the right time like that the pollen

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,640
donors already and that the uh the

65
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:31,079
females are ready to receive at the

66
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,779
right time and then there's another

67
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,180
group of people who are interested in

68
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,759
collecting pollen storing it you know

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,459
what it takes to store

70
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:46,259
um and you know retain viability on the

71
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,459
pollen so maybe the first question is

72
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,919
um

73
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,780
how do you stagger males and females if

74
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,339
you're trying to line them up so one of

75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,360
the questions we have is actually from

76
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,759
Lily from our Discord okay and Lily is

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,420
trying wanting to do an open pollination

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,079
on some of those AK packs yeah yeah

79
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,059
um

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,560
they do not want to collect pollen they

81
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,900
do not want to dust they just want to

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,039
let it rip so yeah how would they

83
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,739
stagger

84
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,239
males and females so the best way to

85
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,800
stagger males and females the only time

86
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,900
that really needs to be done or

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,659
considered is if you're Crossing like a

88
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,480
short flowering female to a long

89
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:26,818
flowering male say or vice versa like

90
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,738
that most of the time males will flower

91
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,958
and there's not really any staggering

92
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,400
needed if it's the same exact strain and

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,439
they're all flowering at about the same

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,280
exact time the only time it really needs

95
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:41,340
to happen is when you've got an Afghani

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,120
um Afghani type let's say female or and

97
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,340
like a haze male you know or uh vice

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,140
versa let's say a haze female in an

99
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,120
Afghani male The Afghani male will be

100
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,518
done flowering you know eight to nine

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,140
weeks whereas that Haze Mill or the haze

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,599
female might not even start flowering

103
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,839
until like week seven to where there's

104
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,699
any kind of uh stigmatic production

105
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,319
so that's the only time it really needs

106
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,598
to be taken into account staggering is

107
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,298
usually a feminized breeding

108
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,738
that that comes into play

109
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,299
okay well that's cool because you

110
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,120
answered the second question which was

111
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,560
from little Kevin in the hood who who is

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,000
talking about how do you deal with lung

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,858
flowering plants

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,500
is the approach to staggering still the

115
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,019
same yeah like I guess like if you sort

116
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,899
of answer that but yeah I mean it you

117
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:30,240
know I mean you have to know

118
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,638
it's a lot harder when you don't know

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,199
the lines that you're working with and

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,939
you're just like making crosses to see

121
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,220
what happens

122
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,978
how to stagger because you don't know

123
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,620
exactly at what point the the female or

124
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,719
male whatever it whatever case it may be

125
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,579
we don't know when it's going to start

126
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,199
flowering and when it's gonna end

127
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,758
flowering and producing whatever you

128
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,520
need it to

129
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,319
um yeah so it does help to have some

130
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,839
kind of knowledge if you know roughly

131
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,300
how long it flowers and trying to go off

132
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,519
you know seed making seed makers

133
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,240
descriptions on flowering can be really

134
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,859
hit or miss so if you're trying to cross

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,139
two totally different types and don't

136
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,360
really know I do recommend a run without

137
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,759
doing it just to see how long they

138
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,400
flower so that you're not wasting and

139
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,160
blowing the whole run on one you can't

140
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,478
use or you know just a whole Mist that

141
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,199
you have to wait till next round to

142
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:24,199
follow me to female

143
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:30,300
um no great advice

144
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,978
Okay so now in terms of the people who

145
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,840
are interested in

146
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,699
um perhaps collecting and then storing

147
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,459
pollen I guess the first question is you

148
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,960
know when do you collect how do you

149
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,758
collect

150
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,519
to begin with

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,259
so what I like to do is use what people

152
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,939
call trim bins

153
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,740
um they used to be called pollen

154
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,660
collectors I think back in the day but

155
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,360
essentially it's what people have or

156
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,740
it's a bin and then on the bottom and

157
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,840
then there's another bin that sits

158
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,340
inside it with a screen on the bottom

159
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,779
yeah and essentially people will trim

160
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,099
over it and the trichomes fall and

161
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,019
suppose you know you scrape up the hash

162
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,580
in the bottom but with males what we

163
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,319
like to do is let them hang over the

164
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:10,800
edge kind of roll it gently roll them

165
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,418
over the the screen and the reason I

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,120
like using this method is because the

167
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:17,519
Petals of the male don't fall through to

168
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,100
the the pollen below the the actual

169
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,779
powder the actual pollen and when you

170
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,520
collect it you're not having to scrape

171
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,719
out a whole lot of male parts I mean you

172
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,279
might see one or two that you have to

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,280
pick out because when you go to then

174
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,379
store this pollen you don't have male

175
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,478
parts with a bunch of moisture in them

176
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,100
damaging the pollen or molding and

177
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,038
essentially killing the pollen when you

178
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,319
store it so that's the best method I

179
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:43,680
found for collecting pollen and and

180
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,439
screening it all in one like in one Fell

181
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,060
Swoop otherwise you know you can collect

182
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,459
it and then you've got to sift out the

183
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,079
male part slowly and there's all there's

184
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:53,939
all sorts of way people have done it you

185
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,818
know like you know putting bags around

186
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:59,279
males once they're ready to collect you

187
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,680
know put a big bag around a branch and

188
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,719
tie it off and beat it around so they

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,120
got it you know take that dump that on

190
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,500
some kind of string sift it there's all

191
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,780
sorts of different ways people have done

192
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,579
it but the the best method for me is

193
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,079
that method

194
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,180
um and we're actually coming back to

195
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,698
some of those questions about like yeah

196
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,439
bagging branches and stuff and or back

197
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,439
you know isolating the whole plant yeah

198
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,240
I'm in terms of in terms of timing

199
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,219
um when when do you collect the pollen

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,840
it's just when the sex are open you know

201
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,860
yeah you want to have

202
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,779
so

203
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,000
when you flower a male you'll notice

204
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:36,179
that certain sacks will open early now

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,660
there is like breeding theory on and I

206
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,800
think some of it is just like based on

207
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,439
experience as opposed to scientific

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,418
theory on in cannabis on you know the

209
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,740
pollen that opens the earliest is a

210
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:48,899
different color than the pollen that

211
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,699
opens later you know though there's

212
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,799
theories that the more mature pollen is

213
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:56,280
so much better to use than the the

214
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,020
earlier flowering less mature pollen

215
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:02,219
um I've never noticed a major difference

216
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:05,459
in all of that usually any pollen that

217
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,979
starts dropping I collect into the trim

218
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,779
bin and slowly collect it over time and

219
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:11,399
then sift it all together that's usually

220
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,198
how I do it but some people are very

221
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,698
fastidious and say like oh no I only

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,680
collected after a certain point the

223
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,319
other stuff I just let draw you know

224
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,478
don't collect at all but I've never had

225
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,460
really any issues with that or seen any

226
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:27,779
notable difference

227
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:30,418
yeah okay so earlier I think you

228
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,519
uh you you mentioned that moisture

229
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:34,139
obviously is is one of the key things

230
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,500
you're trying to

231
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:40,019
um avoid and so in terms of storing

232
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,759
pollen for it to remain viable for as

233
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:46,500
long as possible you know what are your

234
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,159
suggestions some morass was asking

235
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,139
um

236
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,019
yeah how do you store it how long can

237
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,879
pollen remain viable for should I cut

238
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,799
with corn flour like some people

239
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,240
recommend

240
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,939
um

241
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,159
so I don't like cutting with anything

242
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,320
like I don't see a reason to do that

243
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,778
some people think that it um like weighs

244
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,278
down the pollen makes it all better or I

245
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,740
you know there's all sorts of different

246
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,639
reasons people cut pollen that I've

247
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,620
heard over the years but I've never

248
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,980
found a good reason for it

249
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,679
um with pollen storage I also don't have

250
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,440
a super good answer on on how long it

251
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,620
stays viable because I've seen it stay

252
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,560
viable a year without being stored and

253
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,600
just living in you know like air vents

254
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,639
in a house but I've also seen people

255
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,339
intentionally store it really well in a

256
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,379
freezer and a month later it's dead

257
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,700
um and that's without any kind of visual

258
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,278
contamination

259
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,959
so it's really hard to say there's no

260
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,419
guarantees when it comes to pollen one

261
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,759
on how long it'll stay viable there's

262
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,699
just no guarantees on that

263
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,539
um me and a few other breeders in our

264
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,879
group

265
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,860
um don't like to store pollen in the

266
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,600
first place because when we go to use it

267
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,120
we've had so many bad experiences over

268
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,459
the years with like just it not taking

269
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,799
or not being as consistent you know

270
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,379
after it sits for a month that it's not

271
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:11,099
really worth storing

272
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:12,958
over time so I don't have really great

273
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,820
recommendations other than to say the

274
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,559
way that we've tried it and that you

275
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,180
know making sure all of the pedals like

276
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,759
whether people realize it or not there

277
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,799
are pedals on the male flower if you

278
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,480
look at it real close it's a it's a male

279
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,059
flower you know that hangs down the

280
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,920
petals are put are opened up and that's

281
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,419
what the stuff falls out of now those

282
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,979
little parts that open up that's not

283
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,500
pollen that's a part of the petals and

284
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,879
we do not collect that so that's like

285
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,860
one of the most important things that I

286
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,019
see most errors made are that people let

287
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,759
petals in their pollen now when they

288
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:44,278
scrape it up and you could put it in

289
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,259
like a black film container like the old

290
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,519
um photography film canisters are

291
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,139
perfect

292
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,578
um anything dark you don't want any

293
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:53,039
light getting to it light destroys

294
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:54,899
pollen and moisture destroys pollen so

295
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,059
you you know you put it in that seal it

296
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,480
up put it in the freezer put it inside

297
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:02,278
of two you know freezer bag tight uh

298
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,339
Ziploc baggies throw that in the freezer

299
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,559
and um row your dice is about your best

300
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,360
bet when it comes to pollen storage you

301
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,039
know I've seen people sell it and I've

302
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,440
also heard nightmares about the

303
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,120
customers you've watched sold pollen

304
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,640
that's been stored x amount of months

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,440
you know and sent by a male

306
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,019
um if you're gonna do that just beware

307
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Paul and you know it's it's very Hit or

308
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,159
Miss very Hit or Miss is that a recent

309
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,720
thing people selling pollen or is that

310
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,699
no has been going for a while Lauren

311
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,560
it's more recent I mean the past maybe

312
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,660
three or four years I started seeing it

313
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,458
pop up and I just because most people

314
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,620
know like that have been making seeds

315
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,599
how unviable stored pollen can be and

316
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,159
how unpredictable so it wasn't really

317
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,420
like a market but now that more people

318
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,799
are trying to make seeds and don't

319
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,139
really have any knowledge about it

320
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,620
they're more susceptible to buying it

321
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:53,100
you know I've seen right so yeah

322
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,240
yeah another kind of uh Ploy yes 100

323
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,820
okay

324
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,500
yeah 100 yeah

325
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,778
um I guess well just what we're talking

326
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,980
about uh storing pollen and all that and

327
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:03,360
you kind of mentioned obviously you've

328
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,159
had quite a bit of experience with this

329
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,740
like do you have any do you have any

330
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,679
funny stories about storing pollen or

331
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,360
like pollen fails or

332
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,078
um I've seen I've seen

333
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,419
oh [ __ ] I've seen pollen cut with

334
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,539
cornstarch and have weevils pop up in it

335
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,578
that was pretty gross

336
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,219
um you know I'd like I just mostly the

337
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,919
stories are like pollen storage it looks

338
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,300
fine you go to dust it and you know it's

339
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,500
it's something you're really relying on

340
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,059
like a lot of times when we would store

341
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,278
pollen it would be feminized pollen

342
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:38,039
reverse pollen because one it's a pain

343
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,659
in the ass to do two it's never assured

344
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,980
that it's gonna drop no matter what

345
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,838
spray you're using or technique you're

346
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,220
using it's never a shirt it's gonna drop

347
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,019
three it's never sure it's going to be

348
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,759
viable so when you get it you know it's

349
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,500
viable a lot of times you treat that

350
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,539
like gold and want to store it but the

351
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,240
problem is like when we've gone back and

352
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:58,620
used it we have to wait you know

353
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,919
four days a week to see if it took and

354
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,899
usually that's during Prime dusting time

355
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,259
and we'll get into what prime dusting

356
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,539
time is yes we will and

357
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,299
if that doesn't take then you're also

358
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,159
back a week on Prime dusting time and

359
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,859
you have to either hope that you have

360
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,799
other pollen somewhere another you know

361
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,778
a plan b or your crop is now going to be

362
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,639
sensimia that's been dusted by unviable

363
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:26,578
pollen you probably don't

364
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,019
you know it's just yeah one of those

365
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:29,759
things yeah

366
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,440
then again some people say they smoke

367
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,439
pollen so there is that too

368
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,639
what that's the thing yeah yeah I heard

369
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,220
the other day about someone saying that

370
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,539
they got oh I think it was the zomia guy

371
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,579
was talking about some guy gets the

372
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:48,360
pollen and puts it in his mouth and like

373
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:50,399
uses it like medicine like choose it

374
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,200
I mean I think someone was joking in the

375
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,659
survey the other day about getting

376
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,759
tricking people and doing lines a bit I

377
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,799
mean oh yeah

378
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,179
I think that was um on csi's post when I

379
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,399
was trying to tell people they should do

380
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:03,739
lines of it

381
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,278
that was me that was

382
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,320
yeah

383
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm trying to trick people into doing

384
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,959
lines of pollen yeah I've seen that done

385
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,659
too that is the most hideous horrid like

386
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,739
sinus infection you can ever get is is

387
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:21,600
uh snorting pollen I would imagine yeah

388
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:24,360
don't kids at home don't do that do not

389
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,000
start Pawn if what there's no drugs in

390
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,860
it there's no it's just gonna make you

391
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,220
sneeze a lot and probably give you an

392
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,220
infection

393
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,778
the post was about the post in in

394
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:41,278
reference to it was um CSI asking you

395
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,139
know he's heard about people smoking

396
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,778
their males what do you people think

397
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,000
about this and I said everybody knows

398
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:49,860
that you snort the males and only

399
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,958
dummies smoke

400
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,940
foreign

401
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,859
but yeah no there were people chiming in

402
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,079
saying yeah I always smoke my meals yeah

403
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,839
they're heady and I'm like I get that

404
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,578
there are resin glands on some males not

405
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,899
in prodigious amounts some have them in

406
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:05,458
prodigious amounts and I tend to think

407
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,480
those are more intersex type males and

408
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,979
not males that you'd want to be using

409
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,259
anyways

410
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,959
um but the ones that have some resin I

411
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:16,559
guess maybe people can smoke like the

412
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:20,578
those petals but I can't imagine smoking

413
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:23,338
pollen for any reason at all

414
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:25,679
I mean yeah I know we're not really

415
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,839
going to talk so much about selections

416
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,638
today but it is interesting right the

417
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,860
whole process is like

418
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,720
because it's so opaque people have to

419
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,759
people come up with like all kinds of

420
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,259
strange like almost like divinatory yeah

421
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,198
that's what it is it is trying to make

422
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,639
these selections like I cast my rooms

423
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:45,958
and yeah I mean because you have to

424
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,000
start somewhere and there's no real

425
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,739
defined way to start because you don't

426
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,440
know what you have until you run the

427
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,940
progeny and that's really all that boils

428
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,540
down to so people have come up with all

429
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,639
these methods they think or Voodoo yeah

430
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:02,639
like you said you know like read the

431
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,759
bones read the Stars you know yeah

432
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,039
okay well okay coming back to this

433
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,559
process of making seeds and you already

434
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,360
you already gestures towards this when

435
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:17,578
do you when do you want to pollinate

436
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:20,100
your females and how Okay so this is a a

437
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:22,500
good good one to use like a rule of

438
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,820
thumb for all females no matter when

439
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,539
they're flowering

440
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,240
you want to pollinate them when when

441
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:32,039
their hairs are the most white right

442
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,778
when they have the most white hairs

443
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,879
everywhere is when you want to pollinate

444
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:39,240
them the second you see the hair start

445
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:42,120
to die off that is a non-receivable

446
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,159
point for pollen that means that hair

447
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,500
can no longer receive pollen and trans

448
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,539
you know transport the the seed into the

449
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,519
ovule or whatever's going on I don't

450
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:52,620
know the the technicality of it I'm

451
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,698
trying to make it seem more human but

452
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,740
that's not really what's happening

453
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:58,019
obviously but yes that's that's that's

454
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,240
technically what's going on the hair

455
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:03,778
receives the pollen the pollen grain

456
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,019
pollinates the embryo right here forums

457
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:08,578
and the bract and then you know

458
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,259
um so if the hair is dead it can't

459
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:12,959
receive pollen therefore that bract

460
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:15,539
cannot make seeds so you want it to be

461
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,298
where the ultimately where it has the

462
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:20,338
most white hairs living without any died

463
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:22,500
off that is the perfect point for

464
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:25,198
pollination at all times no matter what

465
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,259
sometimes that can be a 13 weeks flower

466
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,820
you know Malawi's hazes whatever

467
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:31,140
um sometimes it could be at 20 weeks

468
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,119
flour on some of that stuff and

469
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,280
sometimes it can be week five week six

470
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,659
sometimes it's week four

471
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,339
um it really just depends on the line

472
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,140
you're running but overall the rule of

473
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,939
thumb is the most white hair is the

474
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,820
least amount of brown hairs

475
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,279
yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense okay

476
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:50,099
so in terms of like the actual method of

477
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,798
pollination like I mentioned earlier I

478
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:54,058
guess we uh obviously you know you can

479
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,918
just have your plants in the same room

480
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,259
your males and females and just let them

481
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,880
go but I guess uh some of these

482
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:01,440
questions are more about

483
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,360
uh for lack of a better term like

484
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,058
partial or isolated pollination

485
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,979
techniques like so dudeness mentioned

486
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:10,798
yeah small pollen runs and applying with

487
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,480
brushes morass was like yeah you know

488
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,700
pollinate can you pollinate one branch

489
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,679
and let the rest of the plant flower you

490
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,319
know that kind of thing

491
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,600
um can you abuse even was like oh can

492
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:24,240
you can you brush

493
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,159
multiple pollen sources multiple

494
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,660
yeah yeah yeah

495
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,538
um and you know what are the risks there

496
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,840
so yeah variety of questions about

497
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:36,000
brushing on and so the logic of this the

498
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,159
logic of this is presupposing that you

499
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,558
have a completely opposite and distant

500
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,019
storage place for males

501
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,859
because if you're doing isolated

502
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:49,859
pollinations you do not want any chance

503
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:53,639
for any of these males to flower in the

504
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:56,759
same building as your your receivers and

505
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,340
I guess that also kind of um

506
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,240
gets down to pollen isolation I don't

507
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,240
know if you want to talk about that

508
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,279
first maybe before we discuss that well

509
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,900
I I thought maybe we would have a whole

510
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,599
section on the different isolation

511
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,220
techniques and so maybe here you're just

512
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,099
gonna broad stroke but I don't know if

513
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,620
that makes sense yeah I mean

514
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,779
pollen isolation methods there is no

515
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,918
good pollen isolation method in my

516
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,859
opinion

517
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,200
so that's a broad stroke of it like okay

518
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,599
if you're gonna try to do isolated

519
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,440
pollinations in

520
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:34,500
a small environment I wouldn't

521
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,220
if all you have is if all you have is

522
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,140
like a tent or maybe even two tents in

523
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,160
the same house even if they're across

524
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,799
the room

525
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,660
it would be very hard to pull off a

526
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,400
plant flowering

527
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,919
and I'm thinking about like a house with

528
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,759
central air maybe pull off a plant

529
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,160
flowering and and a male flowering

530
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:00,119
because pollen is so fine and so light

531
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,160
and travels so microscopically that it

532
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,719
is very very hard and I always go back

533
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,200
to this case in point

534
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,720
I did my blue bonnet pollinations at a

535
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,720
big at like a 5 000 square foot house

536
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,579
okay and in the back is where I did the

537
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Polish the furthest back room you could

538
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:19,439
possibly do

539
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,019
uh in the front of this place I had a

540
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,179
whole nother room isolated with the big

541
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:25,500
tent and I was like okay so I did the

542
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,259
pollination and this is I did the Blue

543
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,558
Bonnet pollination a year prior a year a

544
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:34,019
whole freaking year prior and I did it

545
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,519
open in that back bedroom so this next

546
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,900
one I was going to do in a tent I wasn't

547
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,480
doing a pollination I was going to do a

548
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,798
sensimilla run and

549
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,079
that run inside of a tent with a carbon

550
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,079
scrubber on the outside

551
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:52,079
still got blue bonnet pollen from a year

552
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,240
prior from the uh the air vents and

553
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,899
ducting which I did the only place I

554
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,359
didn't clean was my my central air

555
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:04,500
got pollinated like it was a decent

556
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:06,779
pollination of of a tent separated with

557
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,298
a carbon scrubber inside the same house

558
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:12,058
in a completely separate room so for an

559
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:13,500
example that's how easy it is and it

560
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:16,200
wasn't just kind of pollinate it wasn't

561
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,419
just a few seeds it was enough to do

562
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,700
it was enough to get a look inside stuff

563
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,500
like you know like 500 seeds of plant

564
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,058
like a lot

565
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,619
um not a lot but I mean enough to where

566
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:27,599
it wasn't just a grain here or a grain

567
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,918
there it was a serious contamination and

568
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,899
it would ruin a sensimilla run

569
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,059
completely

570
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,120
um so when trying to do like these

571
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:38,158
isolated pollen runs it is best if you

572
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,479
have some way to store your mail at a

573
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,159
completely different location that's the

574
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,279
only time I would say I would attempt

575
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:46,380
any kind of isolated pollen introduction

576
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,178
no it's really fascinating and actually

577
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,280
we have a bunch of different questions

578
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:53,038
on like different possible ways of

579
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,139
isolating so maybe we actually will come

580
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,179
back to this I reckon and for now why

581
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,299
don't we just assume we have some pollen

582
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:03,080
we will we won't mention how but pollen

583
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:06,000
for now okay and

584
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:08,819
given and if we skip the contamination

585
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,058
issue yes if you have some pollen yeah

586
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:14,579
and you did want to say try to just do

587
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:16,319
one branch or like you know different

588
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,178
branches with different kinds of pollen

589
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,819
like

590
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,679
how well does that work in and of itself

591
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,119
so I mean yeah people have done it very

592
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,340
effectively over the years as long as

593
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,678
the the males were kept separate and

594
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,000
introduced you know one by one a lot of

595
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,460
times what people will do instead of

596
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,099
just so there's a few techniques there's

597
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,798
the bagging technique bagging technique

598
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,538
a which would be to have a bag and a lot

599
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,220
they make pollen bags specifically for

600
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:43,619
this that let air breathe but not

601
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,960
they're so tight that the pollen can't

602
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,038
escape that's supposedly the theory I

603
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,538
haven't ever used these things but

604
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,339
that's that's how they supposedly work

605
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,558
and they I've seen it work

606
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,538
um and you put this over the branch that

607
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,279
that you're wanting to pollinate so you

608
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:58,919
insert the branch into this bag you tie

609
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,619
it off and then you kind of agitate it

610
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,259
um you know you you let that sit a few

611
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,939
days you take it off you blow down the

612
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:08,099
plant with some water you know what I

613
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,659
mean you don't want to mold the plant

614
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,038
obviously but you want to wash it off so

615
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,720
the pollen isn't viable and hitting

616
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,879
other branches that's the theory of

617
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,460
washing it off and uh yeah that's one

618
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,659
method another method is to tie off all

619
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,298
branches

620
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:24,299
and then do that one branch

621
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:26,819
Undo It spray it off with water and then

622
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:28,379
undo all the other branches but that

623
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,759
obviously opens you up to more molding

624
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,960
if you're doing every single Branch even

625
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,400
though that there's air Exchange in

626
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,840
these bags there's still a chance to

627
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
bring in bold you know

628
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,759
uh yeah that's another method and it's

629
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,839
it's doable you know some people like to

630
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,359
introduce

631
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,579
um pollen via brushes but brush I mean

632
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,139
you've got to remember pollen's tiny

633
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:47,158
when you're using these brushes brushes

634
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,380
even if you don't see it some of these

635
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,700
bristles will click and it'll flick for

636
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,559
sure and if things aren't tied off

637
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,360
everywhere like using those bags or

638
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,220
other kind of bags it's going to flick

639
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,500
onto other branches I mean this is light

640
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,240
stuff so it's just a really it's just

641
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,159
like anything the more care you take the

642
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,079
more time you take the more accurate you

643
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,460
can be when it comes to stuff like that

644
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,199
as long as your male is somewhere else

645
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,840
if your male is in the same room again

646
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,759
or in the same house it's very hard to

647
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,339
contain and but

648
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,740
I mean there's ways to do everything

649
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,980
you know it just this time patience

650
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,558
money you know pot they make pollen

651
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,480
chambers of money you know if you have

652
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,918
the money for a real true isolation

653
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,538
chamber that would be great but I don't

654
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,400
know anybody who has those

655
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:31,558
yeah

656
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,780
so so going back to Boo's question on

657
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:35,940
like which seems now to me given what

658
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:38,819
you've said like quite ambitious which

659
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,740
is like you dust different branches with

660
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:43,200
different pollen

661
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,798
um which you can do it but I imagine

662
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,200
again there's like a decent risk that

663
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,179
your branches across yes

664
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,740
cross-pollinated right yeah I mean

665
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,320
there's a good chance that there will be

666
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,179
some cross-contamination like well um

667
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,099
yeah pretty high

668
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,419
um but if if you're doing that you're

669
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:02,699
only getting a small amount of seeds

670
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,038
anyways if you're doing Branch you know

671
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,659
Branch style pollinations and it's just

672
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,400
for most likely just for you or your

673
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:10,380
friends to look at so yeah

674
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,059
cross-contamination thing probably there

675
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,320
isn't as important because it's mostly

676
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:15,058
just for people to get a look at their

677
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:17,759
stuff if you're doing if you're if

678
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:19,798
you're like selling Branch made seeds

679
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,940
then you should probably start like

680
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,259
having a serious talk with yourself

681
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,538
about like

682
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,679
is this really what I think it is you

683
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:28,259
know do some

684
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,120
you know personal bias confrontation is

685
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:32,940
this really isolated as much as I think

686
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,619
it is and should I sell this is it a

687
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,880
decent representation of what I want to

688
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:37,319
sell

689
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,760
yeah this is where your personal ethics

690
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,558
and morals come into play I guess

691
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:45,240
absolutely yeah

692
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:46,918
yeah okay all right so

693
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,700
um was there anything else you wanted to

694
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,820
say on the actual Act of pollinating

695
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,819
um

696
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:02,700
so usually it takes anywhere from three

697
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:04,798
days to a week to watch the pollen take

698
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,840
so watch to know that the pollen has

699
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,778
taken and usually the way we know that

700
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:12,000
is that the hair dye's off yeah usually

701
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:14,339
it and and if it's not just one or two

702
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,259
it's several where you pollinated

703
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:19,019
then you know it's taking the pollens

704
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:21,960
viable but usually that three days to a

705
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,859
week is like breath holding time it's

706
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,380
the worst especially if you're doing

707
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:27,058
reversals you are like on pins and

708
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,480
needles holding your breath every time

709
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:33,119
me and inspect us yes I are like

710
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,159
you know like every time you know oh my

711
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,599
it worked you know we're bubbling

712
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,340
holding our breath for each other's

713
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,980
reversals because something this is hard

714
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:43,019
and and it's very expensive to fail and

715
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,058
it's very it's very expensive very

716
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,859
demoralizing to fail you know like to

717
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:49,619
have something look really good form

718
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:51,719
balls you know like do all that get to

719
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:53,819
the process and just and drop pollen and

720
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,140
then it's not viable that's

721
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,759
brutal

722
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,860
yeah because I guess it's like quite a

723
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:00,658
long gamble right you obviously you have

724
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,219
to grow the plants and like get the

725
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,360
pollen do all the stuff and it doesn't

726
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,400
work

727
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,899
and in our cases it's not just one plant

728
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,159
that we're reversing we're reversing

729
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:14,820
many to try to beat the odds of um of

730
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,799
you know sterile pollen or Paul pollen

731
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:18,658
or balls not forming you know what I

732
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,119
mean because that can happen too even if

733
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:24,000
it's the same clone of the same thing in

734
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,819
the same tray in a micro climate you can

735
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,099
have three not Flip or you know three

736
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,439
totally flip not drop pollen and seven

737
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,839
totally flip and drop pollen or vice any

738
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,038
of those numbers could switch around so

739
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,980
it's like we're not even doing just one

740
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,019
we're doing several you know so it is a

741
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,099
big undertaking and a big gamble for

742
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,599
sure

743
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:44,579
yeah and we're gonna come back to

744
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:49,139
reversal specifically

745
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:51,418
um after this okay okay so

746
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,940
um if you're happy we can move on to you

747
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,320
know when will seeds be ready and how do

748
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,140
you collect seeds and how do you store

749
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,778
seeds you know for long-term viability

750
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,179
so for a long time viability and storage

751
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:05,278
seeds there is a small process it's not

752
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,559
as simple as make the seeds pluck them

753
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,119
out and sell them right away

754
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:12,359
um or maybe before you get into that

755
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,178
like when when do you even like oh okay

756
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,619
uh when I see it's ready so if I'm like

757
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,840
explaining this to someone who has never

758
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:20,339
harvested seeds before how do they know

759
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,778
when their seats are ready without

760
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,678
chopping their whole plant I'm just

761
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:25,798
hoping

762
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,700
so there's always a few methods that I

763
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:28,798
use

764
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,380
and first you want to look at the tops

765
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,658
usually you can see in the tops where

766
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,460
the light hits the strongest you can see

767
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,140
if there is brown sticking out of the

768
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,940
tops right and then you know if you're

769
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,860
if you have some mature seeds at the top

770
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,600
usually if you're seeing Brown seeds

771
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:44,339
poking out that means that those seeds

772
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,599
at the top are fully mature this is

773
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:48,178
where a lot of people make the mistake

774
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,579
of chopping their plant and just being

775
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,140
done letting it you know dry out and

776
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,599
then finding out that most of the seeds

777
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,159
are immature because the the seeds at

778
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,319
the top with the most light tend to be

779
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,778
the most mature the fastest what I like

780
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,918
to do is go to the the bottom of the

781
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:04,079
plants and I'm not talking about the

782
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,460
armpits because the armpits I forgot

783
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,839
what they're called the primordial seeds

784
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,720
I believe they're called that form in

785
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:11,759
the armpit area of the seeds or of the

786
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,179
plants those almost always form real

787
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:18,538
healthy ripe and are done fast

788
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:21,240
interesting yeah but yeah but the the

789
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,980
seeds in like a bottom Bud getting the

790
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,419
least amount of light those are the ones

791
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,860
that interest me because when those are

792
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,480
done and if they're done in multiple

793
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,959
locations on the bottom of the plant

794
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,000
that's usually a good

795
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,980
uh predictor of the rest of the plant

796
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,778
now usually I'll do like four spots on

797
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,880
the bottom four spots on the middle four

798
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:41,099
spots on the top and if all of them are

799
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,440
coming out nice and mature then that's

800
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,058
when I start to harvest uh otherwise if

801
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,500
there's any immature in there I'll give

802
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:48,000
it another week I don't even look at it

803
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,919
I'll give it a whole other week and just

804
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,659
come back to it later but that's that's

805
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,659
usually the best predictor go down to

806
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,159
those bottom nugs and check those check

807
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,320
the maturity and when I'm talking about

808
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,000
maturity there's a few things also when

809
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,759
it comes to seeds

810
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,220
um there's there's the seed string if

811
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,079
you're able to uh put it in your fingers

812
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,519
and not crush it immediately with just a

813
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,460
good amount of pressure like right away

814
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,918
that's a good sign that there is is um

815
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,500
viability to the seed if you could drop

816
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,960
it on a hard surface and you hear a

817
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,700
sound like a ping like a a specific

818
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,558
sound that's a good sign it means that

819
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,240
there's weight and heft to the Sea

820
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,759
there's probably an embryo in there

821
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,798
that's viable and the look of course but

822
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,599
the look is is something that a lot of

823
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,460
people don't get like tiger stripes a

824
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,980
lot of us use seed blowers now and that

825
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,200
can blow that that thin layer that tiger

826
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,759
stripe layer is a thin layer and that

827
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,919
can be blown off just by using these

828
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,179
blowers and and agitating the seeds and

829
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,480
knocking them against each other in the

830
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:47,700
blowers the best the best predictor is

831
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,500
usually color look the tiger stripes but

832
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,000
not all seeds have tiger stripes either

833
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,398
a lot of Southeast Asians are pure black

834
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,259
a lot of Mexicans are pure black seeds

835
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:57,298
Sometimes some are just hard gray you

836
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:59,460
know like a dark gray

837
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:03,000
um but the best predictor is the heft

838
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,500
and the touch for me and and and knowing

839
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,179
that you know the rest of the seeds are

840
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,619
mature in the plant right like that's

841
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,220
important

842
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:09,418
um

843
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,278
yeah

844
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,538
um

845
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:14,940
oh go ahead

846
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:17,278
oh I just want to ask like uh in terms

847
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,019
of you know scanning the lower you know

848
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,480
lower branches and nodes as well as the

849
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,500
the higher ones closer to the light

850
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,240
there's I assume based on what you're

851
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,220
saying that there's no risk of leaving

852
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,319
them too long like the the ones that

853
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,940
mature more quickly it's okay to for

854
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,038
them to be left

855
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,080
um

856
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,960
as long as your humidity isn't too high

857
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,058
because I have seen people leave seeds

858
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,100
in their plants too long and have them

859
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:43,019
germinate inside the plants I've seen

860
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,058
that yeah it looks freaky as [ __ ] it

861
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,798
looks like an alien plant like with a

862
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:48,778
you know the tail sticking out of the

863
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,639
buds as opposed to white hairs it looks

864
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:52,740
so freaky but that's the only time that

865
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,020
there's ever really a big risk um seeds

866
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,880
store well in cannabis a lot of things

867
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,918
the times we found like

868
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,720
um if we leave seeds inside Bud even if

869
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,059
they're like in a hot garage it's been

870
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,679
you know 114 the whole summer for

871
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:06,720
whatever reason staying inside that bud

872
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,340
it protects it better than almost

873
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,500
anything else other than fridge or

874
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:12,000
freezer so that's something to keep in

875
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,919
mind too it's a great storage technique

876
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,500
so you're not really hurting your plant

877
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,600
by the seed staying in there longer

878
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,220
they don't get overly mature unless

879
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,480
unless your humidity is way too high and

880
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,919
you just need to check the humidity if

881
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,899
that's going on

882
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,640
no that's a great point and yeah great

883
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:29,519
great points also on all those different

884
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,120
ways of checking for maturity

885
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,119
um

886
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:36,359
so you did you did just mention this but

887
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,579
how about storage now okay so storage

888
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,439
um after you harvest your seeds one of

889
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:43,259
the things that we like to do like at

890
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,880
least in our group is to well first you

891
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:46,919
want to dry them out fully for two weeks

892
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,840
I set them out in like a Ramekin tray I

893
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,880
let them dry out for two weeks full I

894
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,918
want them to be totally dry no nothing

895
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,778
on them and then I'll take those I'll

896
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,340
put them in a freezer Ziploc bag I keep

897
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:59,880
specifying this because freezer are

898
00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:01,439
stronger or thicker millim Mills I guess

899
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,200
they call it for plastic thicker Mills

900
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,058
the freezer bag by Ziploc or whoever as

901
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,700
long as it's a really thick protective

902
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:10,379
layer on the baggie I put them in those

903
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,298
I put them in another one just to ensure

904
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,220
that no moisture can get in and then I

905
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:15,839
toss them in the fridge or freezer

906
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,399
either one for me doesn't really matter

907
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,158
I like fridge

908
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,658
um for for the first run and I'll throw

909
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,360
them in the fridge for another two weeks

910
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:26,820
and that simulates the process of winter

911
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,339
like when seeds are dropped from the

912
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:31,139
plant naturally and they kind of bury

913
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:32,639
themselves underground they stay cold

914
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,980
for the whole winter when it gets hot

915
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,659
then they germinate that's the idea we

916
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,659
want these things to germinate the first

917
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:42,120
second that they are warm and in

918
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,919
moisture and by going by pushing it

919
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,558
through that fridge process it makes

920
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,538
them germinate very fast after like even

921
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,940
if it's a year after two years after it

922
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:52,500
just that process is ready for whatever

923
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,919
reason

924
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,919
yeah yeah

925
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:01,199
um again for fun storage fails ending

926
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,620
stories anecdotes oh my God we missed

927
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,380
anything weird oh my God so there are

928
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:10,319
very few breeders I know that

929
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,659
um initially started out by buying seeds

930
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,338
and storing them in a fridge most of us

931
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,679
learn that the hard way

932
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:18,659
and like I went through a whole summer

933
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,760
in San Diego that was just the most

934
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,559
brutal summer up to that point ever I

935
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,780
remember moving there from Bakersfield

936
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,219
and thinking why did I move here for

937
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,200
climate when it's just as hot as

938
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,000
Bakersfield and granted the temperature

939
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,858
wasn't the same but because it was right

940
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,019
on the beach downtown and all that like

941
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:36,918
right at the harbor downtown it was

942
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:40,019
insanely hot there so hot that summer

943
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:42,118
and it cooked almost my whole collection

944
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:44,940
of seeds just because I didn't have a

945
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:48,119
fridge to store them in straight fridge

946
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,099
storage is so important and it's like I

947
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,780
said some people prefer freezer I prefer

948
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,280
freezer for long term if I know I'm not

949
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,019
going to be taking seeds in and out if

950
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,820
it's something that I'm like like I like

951
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:58,440
to collect land races from around the

952
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,820
world and I put those in a bag and I

953
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,320
store those in the freezer and I don't

954
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,480
take them in and out to look at them

955
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,519
they're just in there you know and and

956
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,380
that's for a rainy day that's you know

957
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,019
10 20 years down the line when I have a

958
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,119
big climate Outdoors where I feel like

959
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:13,858
they'll be able to be grown best to

960
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,059
express the best so I can see what I

961
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,098
have

962
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:18,838
um but most of the time if I'm taking

963
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,019
something in and out fridge is good

964
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:23,880
fridge is good I don't like rapid

965
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:26,579
drastic temperature fluctuations from

966
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,320
you know below freezing to room

967
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:30,480
temperature within an hour probably

968
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,300
wouldn't be that good for them so I like

969
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,559
doing uh fridge for in and out you know

970
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,900
if I'm taking stuff in and out

971
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,400
repeatedly my fridge storage is just so

972
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,260
important if you can find any room in

973
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,420
your guys fridge for your collections or

974
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,040
if you can afford to run another fridge

975
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,780
specifically for some of the bigger

976
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,059
collections it'll be helping the future

977
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,980
you'll be helping yourself I've watched

978
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:52,980
seeds lose viability in five years

979
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,900
without any kind of heat damage

980
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,240
um I've watched them to stay viable for

981
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,720
15 plus years because of fridge you know

982
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:03,059
and easy to pop so I again

983
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,639
I can't emphasize how many of us have

984
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:08,880
lost whole collections by not fridge

985
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:11,879
storing it is so important

986
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,740
yeah yeah good points and I you did

987
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,500
mention this but I wanted to draw a bit

988
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:18,779
more attention to it if you have used

989
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,119
the freezer

990
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,380
um do you have to pay attention to um if

991
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,119
you're taking them out to actually

992
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,700
germinate

993
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,680
um that transition um in temperature I

994
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:31,618
Like to Move It from the freezer to the

995
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,879
fridge for a day the fridge yeah but you

996
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,440
know I know people that have taken them

997
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,180
out of the freezer to room temperature

998
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,400
and pop them just fine it's just one of

999
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:41,699
those things where I just like logically

1000
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,579
in my head it makes sense to not push

1001
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,618
that fluctuation a whole bunch well

1002
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,539
you're trying to reduce as much risk as

1003
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:50,220
possible yeah reduce the risk and shock

1004
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,739
to the to the embryos because they are

1005
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:55,500
small little things

1006
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:59,819
yeah my little living things

1007
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,380
yeah okay well in terms of the so we

1008
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,838
started this section as it was about

1009
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,579
regular seed making and we yeah I wanted

1010
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,820
to take us through a fairly linear

1011
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:11,160
sequence of steps which we did do

1012
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,320
um so I was thinking at this point we

1013
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,799
could kind of go parallel and and and

1014
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,240
talk about reversals so I guess here

1015
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,039
you've already talked about you know

1016
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,118
when to pollinate collecting seeds all

1017
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:23,759
that so we don't have to go over that

1018
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,358
again uh maybe here we're just talking

1019
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,400
about you know applying the reversal

1020
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:32,098
chemicals or spray you know how how does

1021
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,119
that work maybe you could talk about the

1022
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:35,039
different approaches with different

1023
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,900
chemicals a bit we don't have to go too

1024
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,779
deep but yeah just so people have an

1025
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,400
idea maybe we start with someone who has

1026
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,079
your reversal spray

1027
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,980
how's that work

1028
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,900
one second mom decided to bug

1029
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,159
in the moms

1030
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,200
okay

1031
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,759
so with reversals

1032
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:55,259
um like let's say someone went to my

1033
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,180
site purchased my spray but doesn't

1034
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,160
really know the one thing I would say is

1035
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:01,019
pay attention to what size you're buying

1036
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:03,118
because we have our medium and our large

1037
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:05,460
they both come in the same size bottle

1038
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,280
16 ounces but

1039
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,480
one the the medium is more dilute than

1040
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,579
the large

1041
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,920
essentially to save water weight like

1042
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:15,660
we're only adding water to one to ship

1043
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,280
it to you know to add it to large it

1044
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,960
would have been 64 more ounces or water

1045
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,000
or whatever it is

1046
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,559
um so pay attention to the ratio mixing

1047
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,019
that to water it's super important if

1048
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,400
you get the ratio wrong it can cause a

1049
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:28,199
reversal failure you need to have the

1050
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,599
ratios correct pay attention to that

1051
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,779
large is one to eighteen medium is one

1052
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,359
to nine small is one to nine uh one part

1053
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,839
of the solution the stock solution is

1054
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:42,719
what what we sell to uh nine Parts water

1055
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:45,239
or 18 Parts water uh when they get it

1056
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,559
the the idea is to you know make your

1057
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,919
spray I assume people are going to put

1058
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:52,440
it in 60 16 or 32 ounce bottle you know

1059
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,440
mix it up shake it really well my spray

1060
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,079
is a silver nitrate sodium thiosulfate

1061
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,460
base in their solution so you want to

1062
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,079
mix it really well it's already been

1063
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,720
thoroughly mixed but when you get it

1064
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,300
it's sat for a while Shake It Up really

1065
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,399
really well and you know on the

1066
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,280
instructions we used to say you know

1067
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,858
spray once a day to ensure a reversal

1068
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,680
because if you spray daily your plant

1069
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:19,679
will reverse some plants like it more

1070
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:22,078
only once a week some plants you only

1071
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,239
need to spray once every two weeks and

1072
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,700
they'll reverse just fine some plants

1073
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,739
need it once a day for three and a half

1074
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:30,919
weeks specifically and it usually at

1075
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:34,559
three and a half weeks like on the money

1076
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:38,280
you will see signs of a sex reversal

1077
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:40,199
some kind of sexual uh like

1078
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,220
um usually because what people don't

1079
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:42,960
realize when you're doing reversal

1080
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,939
you're not turning a female or not

1081
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,519
turning a female into a male you're

1082
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,980
making a female have male parts

1083
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,619
and by doing that it's going to maintain

1084
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,139
that female floral structure so the male

1085
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:56,700
parts won't form and hang in the armpits

1086
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:59,519
like they normally would on a male it's

1087
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:02,159
forming in a strong tight budge Bud

1088
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,500
cluster and usually with failures what

1089
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,480
happens is it clusters too tight and

1090
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,460
they can't mature they can't like

1091
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,300
stretch out get their anthers out and

1092
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:15,358
open up and you know fully mature uh so

1093
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,720
some of that is from probably spraying

1094
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,279
too much as best we can tell so in cases

1095
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,259
like those you want to turn it down to

1096
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,560
like what spring once a week or once

1097
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,540
every two weeks with that said when

1098
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:28,980
you're doing reversals by this point you

1099
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:30,719
should know the plant you're reversing

1100
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,699
You Should Know It real well and you

1101
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,639
should expect the first reversal to be a

1102
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:37,319
learning process not a one and done I'm

1103
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:39,420
going to bang this out who's successful

1104
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,619
because you have to learn the plant and

1105
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,200
how it's going to reverse you have to

1106
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,119
know any number of factors and like I

1107
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,338
said I always recommend doing like a

1108
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,099
tray of them because one is really hard

1109
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:51,779
to learn from

1110
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:54,240
you know when you can learn from 12 of

1111
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,460
the same clone and see how each of these

1112
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,259
clones of the same clone interact with

1113
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,300
the spray from which angles and light

1114
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,099
sources you get a lot more data from

1115
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,940
that than you would one plant that

1116
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:06,180
either

1117
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,338
reverses correctly or fails so yeah I

1118
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:10,500
often recommend that

1119
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:14,159
um yeah you know like on a successful

1120
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:17,338
reversal the the the

1121
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,799
buds of male flowers will form they'll

1122
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:22,440
open up and just like a male you'll be

1123
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,720
able to slap the side of it and pollen

1124
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,760
will fly that's what you want in a

1125
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,919
successful reversal there's a lot of

1126
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,300
times where it'll form in that cluster

1127
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,559
and you see that they're open up and you

1128
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,000
see you know you'll pick one of those

1129
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,259
out of that tight little cluster and

1130
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,358
you'll put in your hand and you'll see

1131
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,099
pollen and you know it'll flatten out

1132
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,559
and then you realize oh God I gotta grab

1133
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:43,380
tweezers and each one of these and drop

1134
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,358
it into the trim again and no [ __ ] this

1135
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,338
is like I would say at least half of the

1136
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,739
reversals go this way right where it's a

1137
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,480
tedious process of taking each of these

1138
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:53,899
pedals or each of these floral

1139
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,900
structures

1140
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,500
or you know you drop them all in there

1141
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,480
and slowly agitate them and knock the

1142
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,400
pollen out over the screen but a lot of

1143
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,980
them are like that a lot are like that

1144
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,960
so expect to do one or the other a

1145
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,420
successful reversal where we're who

1146
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,059
that's when you just kind of cap it in

1147
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,039
it and that happens

1148
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:15,719
um but a lot of time expect to be doing

1149
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:18,119
the tweezer method

1150
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:19,739
yeah yeah so different degrees of

1151
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,420
success I guess we could say exactly

1152
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:23,639
exactly and there's nothing's

1153
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,780
predictable no matter what like like I

1154
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:26,879
said whether you're using a silver

1155
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,720
nitrate sodium thiosulfate base whether

1156
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:34,680
you're using a silver nitrate uh Cobalt

1157
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:37,139
green base whether you're using just

1158
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:39,358
um what else is there silver

1159
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:41,759
colloidal silver whether you're using

1160
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:44,819
that it's all the same process on the

1161
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,380
same Bud trying to trying to have the

1162
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,640
ethylene blocking action because that's

1163
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,680
what's going on that's what we're trying

1164
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,559
to achieve and

1165
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:56,819
um produce intersex trades

1166
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,559
okay so uh another basic question

1167
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,599
um when do you even start applying the

1168
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:01,679
spray okay oh no that's a that's a

1169
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:03,420
really good question because I think

1170
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,699
it's one of the most often asked and

1171
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,318
I've seen people like spray you know

1172
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:10,618
while the plants in veg thinking that

1173
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:13,980
might help the idea with spraying is you

1174
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:17,640
want to First you in your brain you you

1175
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,500
need to make a clear division

1176
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:22,139
um you need to make a clear division

1177
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,679
between

1178
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:26,279
um

1179
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:28,618
the the receivers and the donors that's

1180
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,480
super super important in your mind that

1181
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,880
has to be made because when you're doing

1182
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,519
a reversal let's say you have 60 plants

1183
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,440
you're not doing a 60 plant reversal

1184
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,000
like if some of those have to receive

1185
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,619
the plan you know as you receive the

1186
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,300
following so in your mind figure out

1187
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,559
what you want to be the receivers and

1188
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,940
what you want to be the donors and

1189
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:46,500
donors are being the plants that you

1190
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,760
will spray that's that's how we Define

1191
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,599
so you want to you want to mentally

1192
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,000
separate the uh the male donors from the

1193
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,220
receivers and you want to take the male

1194
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,318
donor the plants that will be male the

1195
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:00,358
donors and you want to put them in a

1196
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,940
separate lighting environment maybe even

1197
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:05,338
a tent or another room and you want to

1198
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,440
initiate flower whether that's putting

1199
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:10,259
it into 1212 for you whether that's 11

1200
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,818
13 whether that's 10 14 whatever flower

1201
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,920
is to you

1202
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,719
um you want to initiate flour and on

1203
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,519
that first day that you initiate flour

1204
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,379
to the plants you're spraying you want

1205
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,119
to spray on that first day

1206
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,039
and that's when you'll start counting

1207
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,500
three and a half weeks from to where you

1208
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,420
should expect to start seeing balls now

1209
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,159
that's not always a guaranteed thing

1210
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,260
either sometimes plants will show in two

1211
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:33,420
weeks sometimes they'll show in you know

1212
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,740
three weeks but almost always by week

1213
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,139
three and a half they're showing no

1214
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:39,059
matter how long they flower any of it

1215
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:40,440
they'll always show some sort of sexual

1216
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:43,318
reversal within three and a half weeks

1217
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,880
using my spray specifically

1218
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:47,039
um yeah but yeah you want to keep them

1219
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,200
in a separate lighting source and you

1220
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,880
initiate flower on the day and you start

1221
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,578
spraying on the day you initiate flour

1222
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,818
for those plants and usually when you're

1223
00:44:53,579 --> 00:45:00,300
doing reversals you want a

1224
00:44:56,818 --> 00:45:02,759
a anywhere from one week to two and a

1225
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,920
half to three week staggering period of

1226
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,440
introducing females into the room with

1227
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,139
it so sometimes

1228
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,679
um depending on when that pollen will

1229
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:17,098
drop so let's say after

1230
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,500
you've been spraying it for for 21 days

1231
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,480
or so okay so this is three weeks in

1232
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,460
I'll start introducing some of the

1233
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,380
females in right now to start catching

1234
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,000
the pollen because at about week four or

1235
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,740
five if I'm using like an Afghani type

1236
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,420
or a nine week flowering plant a week

1237
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:32,338
four or five we want those to be

1238
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,960
catching the pollen from this plant that

1239
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:36,480
is just about to start kicking the

1240
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,699
pollen so what about week three it takes

1241
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,740
about three four five weeks depending on

1242
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:42,358
the plant

1243
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:46,139
for it to do that

1244
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:48,179
and you just don't know uh exactly where

1245
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:50,400
it's going to be or when it's going to

1246
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:52,618
fire off so we'd like to stagger some in

1247
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,680
a week some after two weeks some after

1248
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:58,019
two and a half weeks just to

1249
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,399
mitigate the odds everything is an odds

1250
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:00,539
game when it comes to reversal that's

1251
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,059
what you've learned it's like gambling

1252
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:05,039
and it's yeah it is

1253
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:06,539
yeah yeah almost feels like every stage

1254
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,940
has a different I mean it does every

1255
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:10,739
every stage has a different element of a

1256
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,240
gamble right yeah

1257
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:15,239
um and that's why it used to kill me

1258
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,739
like for years when me and Rascal and a

1259
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,239
few others with only Americans doing

1260
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:20,279
reversals and people like the first

1261
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,799
thing you can say is that's a shortcut

1262
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,540
that's cheating man that's a shortcut

1263
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,700
and that's cheap and it's like dude you

1264
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:28,858
have no clue how much of a short this is

1265
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:32,578
so much more labor intensive space

1266
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:35,400
intensive like emotional than anything

1267
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:39,300
like I would I would choose using a male

1268
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,818
all day over reversing if I had my

1269
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,079
druthers and the tools were correct like

1270
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:44,940
the plants were correct for what I want

1271
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,920
to achieve I would prefer to use a mill

1272
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,420
over reversals just because of how much

1273
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,780
easier it is

1274
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:54,539
just the emotions like of loss and like

1275
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:57,060
failures suck it's brutal I've seen so

1276
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:58,980
many people quit so many people quit

1277
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:00,299
like the whole business over over

1278
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,858
reversal failures because it's just

1279
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,339
devastating financially and emotionally

1280
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:07,739
like it's hard for some people

1281
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:11,039
it really reminds me and this is kind of

1282
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:13,078
a bizarre like Assad but it I used to

1283
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,059
enjoy watching these different shows on

1284
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:18,300
like either people who were metal

1285
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:19,739
detectorists or like gold hunters and

1286
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,780
you kind of see the kind of the

1287
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:24,000
psychological

1288
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,800
um game that they have to play with

1289
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,199
themselves where they're like okay we've

1290
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,000
invested all this money on this patch of

1291
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,259
grounds we've got all this equipment

1292
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,358
here

1293
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,579
God please I hope we find something yeah

1294
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,699
right it costs x amount of money to rent

1295
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:41,400
this equipment yeah Etc yeah the time

1296
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:43,559
everything if I broke down how like yes

1297
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,900
I does it and like

1298
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,480
that he still pays you know certain

1299
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,039
certain folks when rooms don't reverse

1300
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,159
like people are still having to be paid

1301
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:55,380
and whatnot like it is a huge expense it

1302
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:57,179
is a massive expensive failure like it's

1303
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,280
okay when it's just me and piddling

1304
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:01,500
around in my place but if I have like

1305
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,140
seven satellite locations that people

1306
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,400
need to be paid at or what have you

1307
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:07,679
um because they live there and it's

1308
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,180
their electricity and whether the

1309
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,480
reversal works or not they still have to

1310
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:14,879
pay their electricity and for their time

1311
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,219
that's when it becomes a serious uh

1312
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,140
business choice you know because that

1313
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:22,439
can add up super fast

1314
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:24,598
yeah yeah yeah so I guess those of you

1315
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,800
who are like not not doing this

1316
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:29,220
commercially

1317
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,039
um be thankful in that sense well I mean

1318
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,659
again and it goes to to what's going on

1319
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,059
in the community that people are seeing

1320
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:38,219
with their eyeballs on you know this is

1321
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:41,639
June 28 2023 when we're recording this

1322
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:43,980
but um the the the climate you know

1323
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:45,719
politically as far as cannabis goes like

1324
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,818
the seed makers are dropping out real

1325
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:50,159
fast a lot of people are folding up shop

1326
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:51,960
and going into some other skill that

1327
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,399
they have because weed ain't doing it

1328
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,318
cannabis isn't doing it seed making

1329
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,180
isn't bringing the money

1330
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:59,579
um you know you're going to start seeing

1331
00:48:57,179 --> 00:49:02,879
a lot less Femme seed makers in America

1332
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:04,619
because of how much it costs to fail and

1333
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,680
probably seen a lot more Spanish

1334
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:10,380
production of Femme seeds um being sold

1335
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,879
by American breeders uh pretending

1336
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,338
they're their own

1337
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,358
essentially that's my opinion

1338
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:16,619
yeah

1339
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,199
yeah

1340
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:21,780
hot take

1341
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,338
no it's good and actually there

1342
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,200
I don't know if we have those questions

1343
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:27,659
in for this episode but maybe for

1344
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,279
another episode there are it's not like

1345
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:30,420
breeding politics it's not something you

1346
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,980
guys have approached you guys obviously

1347
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,139
talked about bringing politics a lot but

1348
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,000
I think someone had a question that was

1349
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,618
like and where I don't think we're gonna

1350
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,659
answer right now but I was like okay so

1351
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:42,000
what's the difference between like a

1352
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:43,500
seed maker and a breeder and like what

1353
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,960
are these breeders doing who are like

1354
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,420
Outsourcing and yeah yeah um we yeah

1355
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,300
that's a whole show in itself yeah it is

1356
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,059
yeah okay okay so we've just covered

1357
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,859
reversals and I'm wondering is this a

1358
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:59,219
good time to kind of like gesture

1359
00:49:55,858 --> 00:50:00,779
towards seed making with autoflowers now

1360
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:03,059
I know that you mentioned to me earlier

1361
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,800
before this started that like

1362
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,119
if we're going to talk breeding Autos

1363
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,579
that's like a whole thing right yeah

1364
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:11,579
because it's very heavily selection

1365
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,680
involved all that yeah but if we were

1366
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:15,839
just focusing on the C making part like

1367
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,480
this was just a one-step thing

1368
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,279
um what what are the differences if you

1369
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,480
were making seeds before it is so the

1370
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,280
biggest thing to take into consideration

1371
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,679
with auto flowers I think a lot of

1372
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,319
people are it's appealing to people

1373
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,419
first that are new Growers because of

1374
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:31,679
the light cycle it's one thing one

1375
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,760
variable they can take out of the

1376
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,379
equation

1377
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,760
that like to people who have been

1378
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,019
growing for a long time it seems silly

1379
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,200
to worry about the light hours because

1380
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:41,818
that's done by a timer you know but like

1381
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:44,460
oh that seriously that's a major

1382
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:46,259
consideration people take

1383
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,880
um another consideration people take

1384
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,380
with autoflowers I think is that it's

1385
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,500
being sold to them that it's going to be

1386
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,720
flowering faster than other plants and

1387
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,599
that it's equally as dank to other

1388
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,759
plants so they the only trade-off they

1389
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,960
think in their mind is going to be the

1390
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,160
light hours

1391
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,380
right

1392
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,699
uh when making seeds with other flowers

1393
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,858
one thing you take it you have to take

1394
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:10,379
into account you can't clone autoflowers

1395
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:13,318
that's their biggest downside if you

1396
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,000
find a keeper in seeds your best bet is

1397
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,759
to have already

1398
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,099
made be making seeds with it you know at

1399
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,240
that point because you can't clone it

1400
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:24,000
um it's not like something you can

1401
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,459
easily Rive Edge because once it's

1402
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,980
flowering it's flowering and that's that

1403
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,199
so it's a major downside to autoflowers

1404
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,420
that you can't keep a clone and breed

1405
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,338
with it so a lot of times people are

1406
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,680
just flowering them out and making the

1407
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:38,940
seeds the first gun you know now if you

1408
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,858
want to make seeds with autoflowers

1409
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,420
without going into the breeding aspect

1410
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:44,159
and let's just say you want to make

1411
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,500
seeds make more seeds of autoflowers

1412
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:49,318
make sure you're Crossing an Autoflower

1413
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,980
to an Autoflower do not try to cross

1414
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:55,679
like an Autoflower line to like some

1415
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:57,300
photo period which only Auto Growers

1416
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,500
call things photo periods so if you call

1417
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,720
things photo period you're calling

1418
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:03,059
yourself out also yeah but you don't

1419
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:07,019
want to use like pollen from a regular

1420
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:08,819
mail onto an auto female or vice versa a

1421
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:10,139
regular female being pollinated by an

1422
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:14,519
auto male because what you're going to

1423
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:18,179
get is a pretty wild distribution of of

1424
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:19,380
photo period and auto flowering mixed in

1425
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:20,519
you're not going to have a fully

1426
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,260
Autoflower line so if you're going to

1427
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:24,000
make more seeds of an Autoflower cross

1428
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,500
an Autoflower to an Autoflower so you

1429
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,900
don't have to worry about

1430
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,179
it I mean I remember like there's a term

1431
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:33,780
that people use which is semi-auto but

1432
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:34,799
is that like have you heard that I have

1433
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,319
heard that

1434
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,559
um there is some stuff like let me think

1435
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:43,460
of a good example Oh Betsy maybe where

1436
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:47,040
it tends to heavily

1437
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:48,920
pre-flower in veg meaning it's always

1438
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,179
kind of like

1439
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,338
flowering a little bit like it's always

1440
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:55,618
it like week two so yeah there's always

1441
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:57,659
some kind of stigma formation a lot of

1442
00:52:55,619 --> 00:53:00,720
those semi-autos you can make seeds with

1443
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:02,879
in veg like if you have a male that you

1444
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,379
know flowers in veg because a lot of

1445
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,780
them will if they're stuck in a little

1446
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,220
Solo Cup like once their Roots hit the

1447
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,019
side they will immediately start

1448
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:13,858
flowering and if you have some of these

1449
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:15,420
you know semi-auto flowers and veg you

1450
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:17,818
can technically make seeds with those in

1451
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,500
veg under 24 hours of light it's one of

1452
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:21,119
the damndest things I've ever seen so

1453
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,460
some people like those because when you

1454
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,800
put those semi-autos into flour they're

1455
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,960
already like two weeks in so it's it

1456
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:30,839
gets like a second stacking as it were

1457
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,400
so some people like it for that reason I

1458
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:34,679
can't think of any other reason to use

1459
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,358
those other than trying to create a new

1460
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,858
autoflowering line through selective

1461
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:40,858
breeding because it already has that

1462
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:42,779
early trigger trait which kind of you

1463
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:45,779
know there is debate on whether rooteros

1464
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,880
is a whole nother uh part or section of

1465
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,760
cannabis or whether it is like an

1466
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,720
Afghani that is just

1467
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,240
has this

1468
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,939
kind of mutant triggering trait as it

1469
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:59,159
were like it's a trait

1470
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:01,858
it can be bread as opposed to being a

1471
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:03,719
whole nother section or type of cannabis

1472
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:05,219
yeah yeah because I think I've seen the

1473
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:07,618
other way I've seen semi-auto is being

1474
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:10,318
marketed as like Fast flowering right

1475
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:12,599
yeah that just sounds now like very

1476
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,759
euphemistic I don't know if like they're

1477
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:15,900
referring to dwarfs because there used

1478
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,640
to be a thing called autoflowering

1479
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,858
dwarfs and I don't really see that term

1480
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:22,019
as much anymore but that was a thing

1481
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:23,639
where like they would supposedly they

1482
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:27,539
would be flowering from

1483
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:29,759
um seed to end a flower in 60 days and

1484
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:31,380
that was what was promised so a lot of

1485
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,720
people fell for that real fast because

1486
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,940
from seed germination to flower in 60

1487
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:39,659
days is extremely fast now it was more

1488
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:42,539
like 75 to 80 which was still fast

1489
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:44,279
considering no veg time but

1490
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:45,539
you know I mean it's not is it so far

1491
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,680
that you're going to take a dive in the

1492
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:48,779
quality

1493
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:51,779
that's worth that

1494
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,599
yeah yeah I actually don't know [ __ ]

1495
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:57,240
about Autos yeah yeah they're they're

1496
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:59,220
gaining popularity I think they they

1497
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:00,779
didn't have any popularity in the US for

1498
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:03,299
a long time when I started [ __ ] with

1499
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,040
them and then lately it seems like that

1500
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,720
there is a group in the U.S that are

1501
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:09,179
just like hardcore autoflowering

1502
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:12,358
enthusiasts which is cool like they need

1503
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:14,159
someone being enthused for them I guess

1504
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:15,960
sure it was big it was big in the

1505
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:18,239
European home grower apartment Market

1506
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,639
that's where it really booms

1507
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,399
yeah and and that makes sense you know

1508
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,078
from from that perspective okay no

1509
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,260
really interesting

1510
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:31,380
well I think for us we've kind of

1511
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,520
covered the like the more linear seat

1512
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,318
making

1513
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:35,699
um set of questions I how do you make

1514
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:36,358
seeds

1515
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:40,078
um

1516
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:42,358
and like I mentioned earlier there is a

1517
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,039
whole section because people have all

1518
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,858
these different

1519
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,960
um questions and ideas about isolation

1520
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:51,358
right and like whether you're isolating

1521
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,940
the males I sing the pollen I sling the

1522
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,199
pollinated branches and I think the

1523
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,240
interesting for us to go through some of

1524
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,039
these questions because sure you already

1525
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:01,799
gestured towards the fact that you're

1526
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:04,199
pretty pessimistic for example about

1527
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,760
uh isolating your males in the same

1528
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:07,558
building right yeah whether that can

1529
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,540
work so okay let's just let's just get

1530
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:11,940
into it

1531
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:14,338
let's dive in so okay of course the

1532
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,800
general question and this one is raised

1533
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:18,358
by dudeness ways to avoid pollen

1534
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,880
contamination in small areas with

1535
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:23,338
turbulent airflow but okay don't answer

1536
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,460
that one because the more specific ones

1537
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:30,358
are like ones from booze setting up an

1538
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:32,639
isolated space for males or donors

1539
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:34,139
um you kind of did talk to this speak to

1540
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,420
this already and I assume he means in

1541
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:40,259
the same building yeah I assume so it's

1542
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:42,960
like do you do it can you do it uh if

1543
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,119
you want to try to do it you know what's

1544
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,500
the best you could do

1545
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:51,358
so I don't I wouldn't

1546
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:53,519
and the best you could do would be to

1547
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:55,679
have enough money to be able to buy the

1548
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:57,300
right filters you know what I mean like

1549
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,279
there's ways to do it

1550
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,140
set it up like a tissue culture lab for

1551
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,900
each one like a mini tissue culture set

1552
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:05,940
up for each one of your males and have

1553
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,400
all the exhaust

1554
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:10,500
going way out of the house at the end

1555
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,059
point tons of filtration but I mean it's

1556
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,639
it would be serious a serious

1557
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:16,260
undertaking to build that stuff

1558
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,358
it'd be worth it it'd be cool to see

1559
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,640
someone do it you know for cannabis but

1560
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:24,139
it would be a serious undertaking but it

1561
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,139
could be done you know

1562
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:29,699
if you can have multiple tissue culture

1563
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:32,099
labs and multiple things being studied

1564
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:33,118
in different places in a tissue culture

1565
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:35,280
lab there's no reason that we couldn't

1566
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,380
pull it off with cannabis

1567
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,480
no but if you're if you're like at home

1568
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,338
you know what what are the what are the

1569
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,159
chances that you'll have access or you

1570
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:46,380
know zero I don't recommend it I don't

1571
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,420
like because you people argue with me on

1572
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,039
this all day and I know it like you know

1573
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,019
some people think that HEPA filters are

1574
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,599
just good enough like tent next to tent

1575
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:57,960
next to tent with scrubbers on them and

1576
00:57:54,599 --> 00:58:00,660
in my experience like I've watched that

1577
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,159
fail epically and the pollen was in a

1578
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:04,199
central air ducting it wasn't even like

1579
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:05,219
it was on the tent you know it didn't

1580
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:07,379
matter

1581
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:10,439
um so you're talking about even

1582
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:12,780
scrubbing like both the intake and and

1583
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:17,240
my exhaust right and so that still is

1584
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:17,240
like infallible it's very fallible yeah

1585
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:23,818
yeah because Boo's next question is like

1586
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:26,338
even like an amplification of that which

1587
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:28,259
is like okay multiple multiple males are

1588
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:30,299
donors

1589
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,960
um keeping them

1590
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,400
um

1591
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,900
because that's even worse right that's

1592
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,818
even that's compounding it even further

1593
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,380
it's not even saying like Okay now you

1594
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:39,298
might get pollination where you don't

1595
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,579
want it now it's like you might get

1596
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:43,739
pollination from God knows which donor

1597
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:47,880
or man it's gonna be a who's your daddy

1598
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:49,798
yeah yeah and I've you know like the one

1599
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,500
thing that I tell people to look out for

1600
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:54,239
when assessing breeders how many males

1601
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,739
are they using and how long did it take

1602
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,919
for them to amass these nails and make

1603
00:58:55,739 --> 00:59:02,879
these lines because if they've got like

1604
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:05,220
a list for example 75 males and it took

1605
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,260
them two years to do it

1606
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:08,939
that's an issue like unless you know

1607
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:11,339
that they've got like this massive

1608
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:13,318
massive corporate production building

1609
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:14,639
somewhere where this is possible if you

1610
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:16,980
know they're making seeds in their house

1611
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,598
and then they've got 75 different males

1612
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,579
in two years you should be very

1613
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:22,980
concerned you should be very concerned

1614
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:26,039
it's not possible you know

1615
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:29,760
okay so if I were to like reframe this

1616
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:32,159
am I right in saying that

1617
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,220
if you if you wanna

1618
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:39,420
do any kind of like seed making at all

1619
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:44,298
you you should be prepared for like

1620
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:44,298
ah uh how do I phrase this well

1621
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:51,240
you should be prepared for everything to

1622
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:53,279
get to get pollinated exactly yeah and

1623
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:55,259
that's why I tell people too like

1624
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,940
um a lot of my friends when they're just

1625
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,859
starting talking about making seeds but

1626
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,940
they want to still run since the Mia

1627
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:01,798
production or I know they're selling

1628
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,240
flour or what have you I always tell

1629
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,500
them there's going to be a point of

1630
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:07,798
where you're going to have to make that

1631
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:09,599
distinction to be I'm either gonna only

1632
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:12,239
sell seeds

1633
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,818
or I'm only gonna sell flour because at

1634
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:16,919
some point you're gonna have a whole

1635
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:18,779
since Amia run get pollinated if you're

1636
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,059
playing with the male in the same house

1637
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:22,260
it's gonna happen so you need to make

1638
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:23,640
that decision and I swear to God

1639
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,079
everybody I've told this too that kind

1640
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:27,058
of ignored it comes back to me later and

1641
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:29,339
it's like yep you're right I had to make

1642
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:32,040
that decision you know like I can't

1643
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:34,318
breathe or I can't gross into me and I

1644
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:37,318
had to switch to all breeding and it's

1645
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:40,558
it's scary it's a scary switch going

1646
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:42,179
from from uh maybe something more

1647
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,920
something that that has been

1648
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:46,139
consistently more money making for

1649
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,599
someone to support their life to jump to

1650
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:50,578
that

1651
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:52,440
yeah because I mean seeds are no

1652
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:54,599
guarantee that they're going to sell

1653
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:58,099
you never know you cannot predict what

1654
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,099
the Market's going to buy ever

1655
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,939
so I guess if you

1656
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:05,579
um in terms of like different degrees of

1657
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,380
mitigation I guess like

1658
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:09,420
if you're if you're just making seeds

1659
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,380
for yourself

1660
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,599
um

1661
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,099
maybe the main thing then is just at

1662
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:16,798
least just having

1663
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:18,180
the one donor if you like say you're

1664
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,920
just a home grower and you're trying to

1665
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:22,019
make seeds for yourself just having one

1666
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,838
meal at least at least if there's

1667
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:26,759
contamination you know well you're a

1668
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:27,599
pretty good guess at where it's coming

1669
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,460
from

1670
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,680
so yeah I mean like some people would

1671
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,380
want to like break it down to oh well

1672
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:36,779
can I keep multiple Mills of one strain

1673
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:39,119
sure and you'll know what line it's from

1674
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,500
but let's say you know you pop a seed

1675
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,740
and you're like oh my God I want to

1676
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:45,539
reproduce this which male made it yeah

1677
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:47,399
you know no you can't do it you know

1678
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:49,139
like that's where you're stuck unless

1679
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,280
you just clone that one plant or if you

1680
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,199
didn't keep clones now you're really

1681
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,119
screwed so you you take that into

1682
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:56,639
account as well

1683
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:58,680
yeah yeah

1684
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,598
and what we we had the last question on

1685
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:02,519
this by I think it's sort of covered

1686
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:04,380
because it the the method seems

1687
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:07,440
irrelevant now but scerson was saying

1688
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,720
you know doing the bag method for pollen

1689
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,240
donors I assume he means either bagging

1690
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:14,159
the whole plan or just begging the

1691
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:15,838
um the branches it's the same right same

1692
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:17,219
risks it's not going to change that same

1693
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:18,838
risk it's always going to be the same

1694
01:02:17,219 --> 01:02:20,879
kind of thing some people do it really

1695
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:25,078
well but like I said it's it's a matter

1696
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,180
of how tedious how how good you are with

1697
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:28,440
like understanding pollen control all

1698
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:29,940
that some people can pull it off real

1699
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,980
well and some people can't some people

1700
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,298
have done it for 30 years I'm just

1701
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,699
really can't and I'm one of the people

1702
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:38,818
who probably would never even attempt it

1703
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:40,558
because I know I'm a [ __ ] and I

1704
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:42,779
would trip or do something stupid knock

1705
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,359
a branch

1706
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,700
yeah yeah okay

1707
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,980
and I think we we kind of covered the

1708
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:51,539
other forms of isolation

1709
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,760
um in terms of like we talked earlier

1710
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:55,920
about isolating the pollinated branches

1711
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,380
themselves yeah and trying to beg those

1712
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,240
so I think we don't have to go over

1713
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,858
those again

1714
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:03,779
um that's kind of it for this like

1715
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:05,279
isolation and contamination prevention

1716
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,500
section and at least in terms of

1717
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,819
questions okay uh was were there any

1718
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:12,659
other points you wanted to make about

1719
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:15,838
isolation contamination I just want to

1720
01:03:12,659 --> 01:03:18,598
drive home the point that you know like

1721
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:20,099
it a lot of people have this idea in

1722
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,740
their head that you always need to have

1723
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:25,920
multiple males from the same line to

1724
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:27,298
preserve diversity and and granted I

1725
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,280
don't want to go too deep into breeding

1726
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:31,318
theory on this but they have this idea

1727
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,839
that they need to use multiple males to

1728
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:36,058
preserve diversity

1729
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:38,279
cannabis is already a very diverse plant

1730
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:40,140
if you're doing it with a line that's a

1731
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,599
polyhybrid it's going to be diverse

1732
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:44,879
whether you use multiple males or not so

1733
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:47,039
just I would I would always recommend

1734
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,260
going with one male

1735
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,058
trying it if it doesn't work out if he

1736
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:54,420
doesn't make what you like select

1737
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:57,839
another meal do it again it none of this

1738
01:03:54,420 --> 01:04:00,000
is easy there's no shortcut there's luck

1739
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,099
luck comes into play a lot and luck can

1740
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,960
be a great helper but there's no quick

1741
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:06,720
way to to rush through this

1742
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,599
intentionally and and

1743
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,618
and intentionally make lines and and

1744
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,599
learn

1745
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:14,760
if you're rushing so that's that's the

1746
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:17,400
only thing I'd drive home be tedious

1747
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:20,400
about pollen control

1748
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,619
um learn about pollen and and how easy

1749
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,358
it it transports and I think it'll make

1750
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:26,640
a lot of sense when people like hear the

1751
01:04:24,358 --> 01:04:28,679
the HEPA Theory filter because there are

1752
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:30,420
a lot of people with tents that that

1753
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,818
make seeds that swear up and down they

1754
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:35,159
can have seven reversals in their house

1755
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:37,980
right next to each other because they

1756
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:40,679
have HEPA filters like it blows my mind

1757
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,818
and people just kind of believe it so

1758
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:43,500
hopefully this will help some of those

1759
01:04:41,818 --> 01:04:47,179
people understand really what's going on

1760
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,179
there and how small pollen truly is

1761
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:53,579
um as a prompt I was curious like

1762
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:56,159
what if you had you know yeah one pack

1763
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:57,900
of regular seeds and you're just like

1764
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:00,719
I'm just gonna let I'm just gonna let

1765
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:02,280
them rip yeah um I know this is now

1766
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:04,558
we're kind of edging towards like more

1767
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,599
breeding because when you think about

1768
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,220
open pollination obviously that implies

1769
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:09,838
they're going to be further stages that

1770
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:12,480
will take advantage of that in some way

1771
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:14,279
but

1772
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,260
you know you just said you recommend

1773
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,519
just using one mail what about someone

1774
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:19,440
who's just like nah I just want to let

1775
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:20,579
the whole pack rip and just let them do

1776
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,159
whatever they want

1777
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:24,780
um what are the trade-offs so like the

1778
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:26,578
only time I would let all males in a

1779
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,700
room is if it's a line that needs

1780
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:32,039
preserving or if I I have too few seeds

1781
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:34,500
to pop and I want to look for more

1782
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:36,298
that's the only time I'd recommend using

1783
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,699
a bunch of males because when we're

1784
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:40,259
doing that the intention isn't a I'm

1785
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:42,358
gonna find a keeper and I want to know

1786
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,460
who made this keeper it's right I'm

1787
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:46,259
going to make more seeds and that's my

1788
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,900
only goal is seed making at this point

1789
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:50,819
it's not breeding it's making more seeds

1790
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,220
to run through and at that point whether

1791
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:56,338
you use two mils or five it doesn't

1792
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:58,259
matter like to me like if you're gonna

1793
01:05:56,338 --> 01:06:00,058
you're going to be doing this for a

1794
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:02,099
potential to run through as many as you

1795
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:03,839
possibly can and at that point it's the

1796
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:07,380
numbers game

1797
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:08,460
yep yep no good points they make a lot

1798
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,079
of sense

1799
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,480
well

1800
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:16,200
at this stage I think we've more or less

1801
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:18,240
covered the seed making side of things

1802
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:20,460
okay and this is anything else you could

1803
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,239
think of uh with regards to just seat

1804
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,440
making

1805
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:24,598
um and not you know not working

1806
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,400
Generations or anything not at the top

1807
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:29,039
of my head no

1808
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,139
okay well here is where we have the

1809
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:34,380
opportunity to

1810
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:35,818
maybe gesture towards like a bit more of

1811
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:40,200
the breeding strategy side of things

1812
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:41,460
okay questions from Digger and Eli Eli's

1813
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:45,058
actually someone who's in a another

1814
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:49,380
Discord with me and booze um

1815
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:51,240
but the kind of like uh I've aggregated

1816
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,480
the questions together right and so the

1817
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:57,298
scenario is this they're home Growers

1818
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:59,940
and they can't keep clones so what is

1819
01:06:57,298 --> 01:07:02,579
the best way to capture slash isolate

1820
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:05,220
slash lockdown

1821
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:06,960
um either outlying traits or an outlier

1822
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:11,038
plant

1823
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,659
yeah as a whole like man not keeping

1824
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,680
clones

1825
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:20,519
and trying to lock down traits

1826
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:22,739
that it would be relying on Pure Luck

1827
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:24,000
right so none of the you know none of

1828
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:27,058
the typical breeding strategies will

1829
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,280
help you necessarily with that yeah like

1830
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:30,599
it I can't think of anything off the top

1831
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,640
of my head or maybe something I'm

1832
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:37,680
forgetting but like

1833
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:39,480
you have to revisit a male

1834
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,739
to use him

1835
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,960
if

1836
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:45,000
he passes on the traits you like I mean

1837
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,980
granted you can get it right the first

1838
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,798
time like I did with blue bonnet right

1839
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:52,619
with the second round

1840
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:54,900
trying to get it right a second time

1841
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:56,358
is very lucky and I remember when with

1842
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,980
the second round I was super happy

1843
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:01,078
because it was so lucky usually the

1844
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:02,818
second time it's like gotta go back do

1845
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,400
it again do it again

1846
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:07,858
but it's always in the process of

1847
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,298
keeping clones with that mindset if

1848
01:08:07,858 --> 01:08:10,619
you're doing selective breeding you

1849
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:13,259
really can't do selective breeding

1850
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:15,480
without keeping clones

1851
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:16,859
that's kind of a key statement here and

1852
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,380
I don't think it would that was very

1853
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:20,759
clear to me either because like you know

1854
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:23,699
there's obviously this common conception

1855
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:25,259
that like okay say I find one one of my

1856
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:27,599
plants in this you know out of one or

1857
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:29,698
two packs I love yeah um I'll just self

1858
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,239
it

1859
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:32,238
but yeah

1860
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:38,640
yeah because you won't know you like it

1861
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:41,279
okay I wonder okay maybe maybe here we

1862
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,920
go breathe

1863
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,020
okay okay okay okay all right vegging

1864
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,179
reveging is the key

1865
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:50,819
so let maybe let me let's reframe this

1866
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:52,560
question so that it I think it will be

1867
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:55,739
more constructive let's okay let's

1868
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,020
pretend that either you have revenged or

1869
01:08:55,738 --> 01:09:00,298
where you may not have Keepers per se

1870
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:02,219
you you can keep something for a couple

1871
01:09:00,298 --> 01:09:03,778
of runs okay

1872
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:04,798
um maybe you don't have like mothers

1873
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,560
that you're keeping for years and years

1874
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:10,019
but maybe you have enough space and time

1875
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,298
that you can keep something for a like a

1876
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:14,040
shorter amount of time yeah

1877
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:15,179
um

1878
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:17,100
I don't know if that makes the question

1879
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,838
easier I mean yeah I mean what if you

1880
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,400
can keep a clone then it's just down to

1881
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:22,500
selective reading and just reading for

1882
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,798
whatever traits you want and that's it

1883
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:28,020
that's like it it changes everything but

1884
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:30,899
like with the Revenge example you can

1885
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:32,100
get you can get creative with that

1886
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:34,139
um

1887
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:37,140
but you have to be able to live with

1888
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:39,960
your plants in 24 hours light during one

1889
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:42,179
point so you can't have like you need to

1890
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,399
have multiple

1891
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:48,119
at least two multiple at least two

1892
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:49,858
spaces one for flowering one for veg

1893
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:51,778
if you're not keeping moms I'm assuming

1894
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:53,940
that you're probably not having a

1895
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:56,219
separate veg area

1896
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,839
by that question

1897
01:09:56,219 --> 01:10:01,460
and that's the point like they only have

1898
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,460
one place to flower and veg

1899
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,640
maybe we do assume that they have

1900
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,840
separate spaces

1901
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,940
um for the sake of the question well

1902
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,520
yeah and at that point it's just yeah I

1903
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:13,919
mean it's just a matter of time popping

1904
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:16,080
popping what you like keep a clone of

1905
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:19,199
the one you like you know

1906
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:21,238
um use a male keep a clone of that if

1907
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:23,460
the progeny run the progeny if the

1908
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:24,779
progeny is good you have your kit you

1909
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,399
have your kept mail then you can drop

1910
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:28,500
him and go on to the next lot you know

1911
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,299
the next failure generation and then you

1912
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:33,479
know select for the same traits find a

1913
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:34,920
male on that use him does it if he works

1914
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:38,459
great

1915
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:41,640
drop him you know after the next run or

1916
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,420
go back pop more of the F2 go through

1917
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,980
that

1918
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:48,060
another male

1919
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:50,218
pollinate it run the progeny Etc repeat

1920
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:52,140
yeah does it change anything

1921
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:56,279
um the fact that like

1922
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:59,280
uh again unlike a commercial breeder on

1923
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:00,899
a larger scale you know you have a few

1924
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:02,759
plants to select from it doesn't really

1925
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:04,198
change the overall strategy though right

1926
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,000
like you're still just working with the

1927
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:06,960
best of what you've got the best it's

1928
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,479
always the best of what you've got

1929
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,239
whether it's it's two seeds pop two

1930
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:14,399
females or 300 it's always going to be

1931
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:16,139
that process because when it comes to

1932
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:18,658
the males they don't display traits like

1933
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:20,820
the female does they're not it's not a

1934
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:22,379
visual trait that we can tell that it's

1935
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:25,319
going to do what we want necessarily

1936
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,900
sometimes sometimes it's not a scent

1937
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:30,420
trait maybe we're using a male for high

1938
01:11:27,899 --> 01:11:32,519
maybe maybe this line that this male

1939
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,658
come from has an extremely rare high and

1940
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,520
that's why we're trying to ease it we

1941
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:36,539
only have a male from that line left you

1942
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,500
know

1943
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:39,119
um

1944
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,819
yeah it's all it's always the same

1945
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:44,760
process always the same process

1946
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:47,819
yeah okay so just I just want to make

1947
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,940
the our reframing of the question clear

1948
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:53,579
because the original question was about

1949
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:55,019
not being able to keep clones which kind

1950
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:57,658
of does make this whole thing basically

1951
01:11:55,020 --> 01:12:00,300
impossible yeah um so we had to reframe

1952
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:03,000
it to be like well you at least need to

1953
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:05,219
be able to rerun something like a few

1954
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,158
times for this to to work out at all

1955
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:10,679
aside from revege aside from revitching

1956
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:12,238
yeah yeah that would be that like the

1957
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:14,340
simple answer would be re-veging would

1958
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:15,718
be the the key yeah to the first

1959
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:18,060
question

1960
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:19,439
I mean maybe just spent a few moments

1961
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:22,739
talking about reverging like is is

1962
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:25,319
re-veging uh

1963
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:27,359
fail proof it's not right like some

1964
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:30,299
plants don't re-vege properly or do

1965
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:33,179
other plants I have no issues just

1966
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:35,699
reveging but I've got a pretty good

1967
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:37,920
process down for it

1968
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:40,319
um the idea is to make sure it has

1969
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,640
plenty of root space one because if it

1970
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:43,500
doesn't then there's all other kinds of

1971
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,659
hormones firing off if it's you know

1972
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,279
root bound and [ __ ] so you're trying to

1973
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:49,198
deal with too many variables so make

1974
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,460
sure it has plenty of root space if I'm

1975
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,139
going to revege something I'm not

1976
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:55,380
worried about harvesting the Bud from it

1977
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:56,820
like maybe maybe I'll Harvest a tiny

1978
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:58,619
amount just to smoke it and then I've

1979
01:12:56,819 --> 01:13:00,119
decided oh [ __ ] this is great I need to

1980
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:02,279
Reve this

1981
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:04,260
at that point yeah because that that's

1982
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:06,539
more likely the the scenario of a home

1983
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,640
grower right yeah

1984
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:11,340
yeah

1985
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:12,900
so the idea behind reveging and why you

1986
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:14,640
would leave most of the bud

1987
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:18,119
is because when I re-vege and I leave

1988
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:20,039
the bud it leaves more sites for New

1989
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:22,619
Growth new vegetative growth to grow out

1990
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:24,899
of out of that bud that's right and when

1991
01:13:22,619 --> 01:13:26,698
you harvest the bud it has a lot of less

1992
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:28,679
there's a lot less places for new

1993
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:31,379
vegetative growth to come from

1994
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:33,060
a lot of times when people revege they

1995
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,440
get greedy about their bud and they want

1996
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,120
to harvest their bud to smoke and if

1997
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:37,859
it's only a little bit you know like

1998
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:39,420
they really want to smoke it

1999
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:41,579
but you again you have to make a choice

2000
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:42,899
is this thing such a good keeper that

2001
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:44,579
I'm going to leave all this Bud on it

2002
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:48,238
let it rot and go to waste just to get

2003
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:49,979
more vegetative material or is it I'd

2004
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:51,779
rather smoke the bud and not worry about

2005
01:13:49,979 --> 01:13:54,238
it once again it's like a numbers game

2006
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:56,279
once again right the more Bud sites you

2007
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:57,479
can afford to leave the higher the

2008
01:13:56,279 --> 01:13:59,880
chances that you have a successful

2009
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:02,158
Revenge exactly and the other thing is

2010
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:05,760
and this is the most important

2011
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:08,879
24 hours of light and it takes about two

2012
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,320
months for a successful revech expect it

2013
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,819
to take about two months to where you're

2014
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:13,799
seeing some kind of good vegetative

2015
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:16,259
growth coming off

2016
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,420
sometimes longer sometimes three but um

2017
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:20,940
it's a long process it's a lot of

2018
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:25,380
electricity in some cases then you know

2019
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:27,419
but if you aren't keeping clones

2020
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:30,359
and

2021
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:33,119
you can't have a separate veg and flower

2022
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:35,759
space then re-veging is your best bet

2023
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:38,939
that's the way to work through that

2024
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,860
okay okay so yeah the 24 hour lightning

2025
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:43,619
almost always ensures it for me almost

2026
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:47,698
always plenty of root space 24 hours

2027
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:49,559
light and plenty of uh Bud sites you

2028
01:14:47,698 --> 01:14:53,698
know or Bud left on it just don't don't

2029
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:55,440
strip it bare and it'll do it

2030
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:57,899
um how long does it take generally quite

2031
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:59,819
a bit right yeah two two to three months

2032
01:14:57,899 --> 01:15:01,019
for it to be complete

2033
01:14:59,819 --> 01:15:04,380
yeah

2034
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,640
yeah it's a long process but granted

2035
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:07,980
there's been so many times where it

2036
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:10,260
saved my ass so many times like where

2037
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:11,698
I'll take clones of something be flaring

2038
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,619
something out and those last few clones

2039
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:16,319
dying I'm like oh [ __ ] all I got it is

2040
01:15:13,619 --> 01:15:18,059
this last plant in flower that's a great

2041
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:19,799
case for reveging too and I you know

2042
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:22,140
like I'm a big proponent of it because

2043
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,340
it's very effective it works great and

2044
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:26,039
the thing that most people don't talk

2045
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:28,860
about with reveging is that it kind of

2046
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:31,679
sets the plant back to zero point like

2047
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:34,019
plants are like some plants that are

2048
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,119
more like slow not as vigorous they're

2049
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:37,739
tired from whatever disease you give it

2050
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:39,658
a good re-vege and that plant will be

2051
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:41,639
back to vigorous and spry it's crazy

2052
01:15:39,658 --> 01:15:43,979
like it does reinvigorate the plant

2053
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,780
somehow and that's just a an

2054
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:47,279
experiential take not a scientific take

2055
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:48,779
but it's something I've noticed enough

2056
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:50,939
to where it's like okay that's something

2057
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:52,738
that happens and then it does and we've

2058
01:15:50,939 --> 01:15:56,099
even we've even gone as far as making

2059
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:58,139
seeds and then re-veging that plant see

2060
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,880
how the seeds form during a Rive Edge

2061
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,260
which is always interesting wow okay you

2062
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,900
can do that

2063
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:05,880
I remember from Forum you know from my

2064
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:09,738
earlier days on the forums like monster

2065
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,739
cropping yeah yeah

2066
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:20,100
uh create much more

2067
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:21,899
plot mess is that yeah yeah biomass yeah

2068
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,060
it's kind of boofy to do it but yeah

2069
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:25,679
that's a that is a technique for sure

2070
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:27,840
but

2071
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,300
um yeah veg seeds reveg seeds usually

2072
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,460
come out more hearty with thicker shells

2073
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:35,039
that's the one thing I've noticed and it

2074
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:36,899
does hold pretty true yeah

2075
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:38,579
uh this is cool this has been a this has

2076
01:16:36,899 --> 01:16:40,379
been a funny little uh side path to come

2077
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:43,219
down I didn't think yeah it is that's

2078
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:43,219
actually quite fascinating

2079
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:50,579
okay well returning to this like

2080
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:53,339
original scenario of like uh I'm a

2081
01:16:50,579 --> 01:16:54,840
homegoer and I've got a keeper that I

2082
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,819
want to like

2083
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:59,279
either try to lock in in a seed line

2084
01:16:56,819 --> 01:17:01,079
basically which is now more just a

2085
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:02,639
general breeding question I wondered if

2086
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:05,219
you wanted to cover that that old

2087
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,020
territory again of like

2088
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:09,960
um in terms of locking in expressions

2089
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:13,500
and traits um the differences between

2090
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:15,899
like back cross reversal uh forward

2091
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:18,479
breathing outcross you know like

2092
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:19,979
is it worth just broad stroking

2093
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:22,079
that I know it's something that you guys

2094
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:23,698
have covered a lot but yeah I mean

2095
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,698
except we're here

2096
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:28,198
let's see I can't I'm trying to think of

2097
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:30,059
a best way to talk about this without

2098
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:31,559
having to go into the detail of the

2099
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:33,360
different generations and essentially

2100
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,560
just be like like if someone wants to if

2101
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:37,259
someone has a cologne that they like

2102
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,239
right and they want to reproduce it the

2103
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:42,659
quickest way to reproduce that clone or

2104
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:44,939
to get a a version of that clone in seed

2105
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,920
the closest version

2106
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:48,658
to that because there's no way to make a

2107
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,520
mirror image of it and see it fast

2108
01:17:48,658 --> 01:17:52,799
that's never going to happen that's not

2109
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:54,360
what s1s are that's not what fence seeds

2110
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,400
are they're not clone versions of

2111
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:58,079
themselves in seed you know the other

2112
01:17:56,399 --> 01:17:59,279
day I got a question from a reader I'm

2113
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:00,779
going to try to rephrase this a little

2114
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,039
bit I got a question from a reader and

2115
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:03,539
they were asking a receipt maker that

2116
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:05,340
was asking

2117
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:07,380
um if I make these Femme seeds are they

2118
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:08,819
going to be clones of themselves like is

2119
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:11,279
this going to be can I tell the

2120
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:15,299
customers if you want to see a clone of

2121
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:17,579
this in seed by these Femme seeds and I

2122
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,600
I had to explain no that's not how this

2123
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:20,460
works

2124
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:24,539
um a lot of people do have that

2125
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:28,679
expectation that a S1 or self line

2126
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:31,140
uh meaning a plant pollinating itself

2127
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:33,719
and making seeds of itself so there's

2128
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:36,060
not any outside genetics coming in it's

2129
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:36,899
just that plant's own genetics

2130
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,820
um

2131
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:41,099
it is not going to be a clonal

2132
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:43,079
representation of that plane to say

2133
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,340
you're not going to pop you know 10 of

2134
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:46,140
those seeds and they're not all going to

2135
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:48,420
pop and look just like that clone that

2136
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,699
doesn't happen and that's not how

2137
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:52,319
selfing works and I think that a lot of

2138
01:18:50,698 --> 01:18:53,879
people have that impression that that's

2139
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:55,559
where they're going to find the exact

2140
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,840
clone and it's just going to be just

2141
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,699
like the Clone mother and even some seed

2142
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,579
makers have this idea

2143
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:04,259
um that's not really how it works but

2144
01:19:02,579 --> 01:19:05,760
if I were going to give someone advice

2145
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,860
and they had a clone they didn't know

2146
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,980
much about breeding if they had a clone

2147
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:12,719
and they wanted to make a seed line that

2148
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:15,299
was most representative of that clone

2149
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:17,399
and try to trap it in seed I would say

2150
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:19,140
go the self route as opposed to choosing

2151
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:20,339
a male from a different line let's say

2152
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,560
it's a femme line that they're running

2153
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,480
you know instead of choosing a regular

2154
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,039
seed or a male from a different line

2155
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,678
bringing in outside genetics and

2156
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:31,019
Crossing it and having regular seeds I

2157
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:32,699
would reverse it using reversal spray

2158
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:34,739
pollinate itself

2159
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:36,178
and by doing so you're not bringing in

2160
01:19:34,738 --> 01:19:38,218
outside genetics so everything you're

2161
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:40,140
going to see are what comprises let's

2162
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:41,520
say if you're reversing bubble gum it's

2163
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:43,619
going to be everything that comprises

2164
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,380
the genetics of bubble gum inside that

2165
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:49,260
self-line sometimes it might be all

2166
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:51,359
really close surrounding that bubble gum

2167
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:53,460
expression sometimes it might just be a

2168
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:55,619
bunch of earthy and bubble gum was the

2169
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:59,039
weird outlier and when I say outlier

2170
01:19:55,619 --> 01:20:00,960
means you know uh it's only one in a

2171
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:04,198
thousands each you'll see this this pop

2172
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:08,279
up whereas the the earthy sweet

2173
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:10,559
expressions are one you know one in ten

2174
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:12,000
or one and two like every two seeds

2175
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,440
you're gonna see that for sure but one

2176
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,359
in a thousand you might see this pink

2177
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:17,519
bubble gum expression that's what an

2178
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:19,679
outlier is

2179
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,380
yeah yeah

2180
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:25,199
um and uh there

2181
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:27,179
if the odds are that steep what what can

2182
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,238
you what else can you do

2183
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:29,239
um

2184
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:35,880
like that the best method is to use uh

2185
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:38,520
selfing because you speed through the

2186
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:40,020
filial generation process much faster

2187
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,060
because you're not bringing in outside

2188
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:43,560
genetic material you're not working with

2189
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:45,000
new stuff that you're bringing in and

2190
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,820
trying to select away from whatever

2191
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,198
plant that is it's all working towards

2192
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:51,899
that single tray and what you'd want to

2193
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:53,639
do you'd self it you'd pop as many seeds

2194
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:55,559
from that selfing as you can until you

2195
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,539
found the one that is exactly like you

2196
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,940
like in that generation you take that

2197
01:20:57,539 --> 01:21:02,880
selection you self that one and then you

2198
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:05,279
do it again and each new generation

2199
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,020
you're going to be getting much closer

2200
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:10,139
and closer and closer if you're doing

2201
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:12,420
good selections to that original clone

2202
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:14,400
in those seed each each round is going

2203
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:16,440
to be really tight and get Tighter and

2204
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:19,439
Tighter and by the S4 you should be

2205
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:21,658
seeing like extreme extreme uniformity

2206
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,158
for that specific trait you're breathing

2207
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:24,899
for doesn't mean that the plant's going

2208
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:26,399
to look like a clone of itself if you're

2209
01:21:24,899 --> 01:21:27,719
breeding for the pink bubble gum tray

2210
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:30,238
all of them should have the feet bubble

2211
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:32,698
gum tray by about S4

2212
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:36,439
yeah yeah

2213
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:36,439
um what are the trade-offs here

2214
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:42,179
down there are multiple self Generations

2215
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,319
the major trade-offs going to be

2216
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:46,140
inbreeding

2217
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:48,059
um mutations uh because you're because

2218
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:51,659
you're selfing you're going to see all

2219
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:53,400
those uh those wild Expressions come out

2220
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:55,679
to the Forefront

2221
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:57,000
um those those recessive genetics as we

2222
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:59,399
refer to them though one in the

2223
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,020
thousands are going to pop up and a lot

2224
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:04,019
of that is also going to be mutations

2225
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:06,300
and inbred traits that we may not

2226
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:09,780
necessarily want so the more inbred it

2227
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:12,679
gets each each uh self-generation

2228
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:15,238
might come with more trash involved

2229
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:17,039
along with what you want

2230
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:17,939
yeah that's the downside that's a

2231
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:18,960
trade-off

2232
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:21,960
yeah

2233
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:24,319
makes sense as we say uh low floor high

2234
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,319
ceiling

2235
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:30,539
yes that's right yeah yeah yeah no that

2236
01:22:27,658 --> 01:22:33,420
makes sense as well okay now

2237
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:35,939
can what about

2238
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:38,039
um for using forward breeding to try to

2239
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:39,960
do something similar like what what are

2240
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:44,219
the differences here like does it take a

2241
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:47,039
lot more time to achieve similar results

2242
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:49,560
um so uh forward reading let's just

2243
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:52,319
assume we have a regular seed line of a

2244
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:54,960
single line uh yeah for just for example

2245
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:57,000
my blueberry uh in Cross which is like

2246
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:59,219
an inbred blueberry line and we have

2247
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:03,539
males and females of that

2248
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:07,920
that would be easy to do like a worked

2249
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:10,319
line of regular just doing F1 F2 F3 F4

2250
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:13,800
because it's a very uniform line as is

2251
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:18,779
now let's say we have for example animal

2252
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:19,860
cookies crust uh animal mints pie or you

2253
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:22,019
know what I mean like something that has

2254
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:23,460
like six strains on one side and six

2255
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,780
strains on the other and they're not

2256
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:27,300
related

2257
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:29,639
you're gonna have a hell of a time

2258
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:31,679
Crossing those running through all the

2259
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,840
potential expressions from this like

2260
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,819
12-way poly hybrid trying to pick what

2261
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,619
you like going down the next route

2262
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:39,960
trying to go through that it would take

2263
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:41,939
so many generations just to try to make

2264
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,859
anything uniform because of all the

2265
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:46,559
traits that both sides bring

2266
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:48,899
which is why I would highly recommend in

2267
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,480
that case using selfie when it's a

2268
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:53,639
polyhybrid clone that you found that you

2269
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:56,698
like the quickest way to quickest route

2270
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,960
is through selfing yeah if you have a

2271
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:00,539
regular seed line of something that's

2272
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:04,020
been were filial Generations that's the

2273
01:24:00,539 --> 01:24:07,260
normal breeding method is is just F1 F2

2274
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:07,980
male female male female male female

2275
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:10,320
um

2276
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:13,019
the only time we really use back

2277
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:16,019
Crossing which is to say like if I have

2278
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:18,780
a blueberry bubble gum on one side and a

2279
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:23,420
blueberry on another side so it would

2280
01:24:18,779 --> 01:24:27,359
ideally ideally be 66 percent blueberry

2281
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:28,560
33 bubble gum in genetics that doesn't

2282
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,859
mean that the expressions are going to

2283
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:33,780
come out that way but genetically 66 and

2284
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:34,679
33 percent

2285
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:38,939
um

2286
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:40,140
uh bubble gum 66 blueberry by Crossing

2287
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:41,579
something that's already blueberry and

2288
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,440
bubble gum with another blueberry that's

2289
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:44,939
considered a back cross because you're

2290
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:47,219
Crossing blueberry back onto something

2291
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:49,019
that already had blueberry in it

2292
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:52,079
um yeah the best the best times to use

2293
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:55,620
that most people like you'll see people

2294
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:58,198
selling bx4 bx5 bx6

2295
01:24:55,619 --> 01:25:00,420
with bx's the best thing that we found

2296
01:24:58,198 --> 01:25:02,339
that it's used for is locking down a

2297
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:06,060
single trade let's say in this blueberry

2298
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:08,039
bubble gum I want to find a super

2299
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:10,620
blueberry type plant in this blueberry

2300
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:12,899
bubble gum so by crossing the blueberry

2301
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:14,880
again lock in that blueberry trait

2302
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:16,500
because let's assume this this blue bit

2303
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,140
this male is true breeding for blueberry

2304
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:21,658
traits so now I've locked it in in this

2305
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:23,340
hybrid now most of the time it's going

2306
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:24,960
to be true breeding for this blueberry

2307
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:27,480
scented tray

2308
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,920
you only need to be X1 one time to make

2309
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:31,198
that happen if you're using good

2310
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:34,380
selections there's no need to take it to

2311
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:37,399
a px2 from that point you should either

2312
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:40,619
work at filial Generations forward

2313
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:42,839
or self Generations forward you don't

2314
01:25:40,619 --> 01:25:45,658
want to keep working backwards using

2315
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,159
back crosses that's not how you lock in

2316
01:25:45,658 --> 01:25:48,839
multiple trades you lock in multiple

2317
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:51,299
traits going forward

2318
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:53,400
this is now this is more you know

2319
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:55,619
Advanced breeding Theory but the idea is

2320
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:57,779
lock multiple traits going forward lock

2321
01:25:55,619 --> 01:25:59,819
a single trait going backwards you can

2322
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:01,738
lock in a signal chart going backwards

2323
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:02,880
then lock in multiple traits going

2324
01:26:01,738 --> 01:26:05,638
forwards

2325
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,199
yeah and yeah going forwards includes

2326
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:08,279
selfie

2327
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:10,439
yeah

2328
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:14,279
very nice that that's an excellent

2329
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:17,279
summary and I I don't think that um I've

2330
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:18,840
heard this account as like succinctly

2331
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:20,279
um as you've presented it here in like

2332
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,560
previous episodes so I'm really glad

2333
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:25,800
that you you covered it there's a great

2334
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:29,760
paper there's an amazing paper

2335
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:31,260
um written by chimera and he's he's like

2336
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,520
I've talked to him about and he said I

2337
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:35,039
probably wrote that when I was drunk or

2338
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,679
something like it was okay it's called

2339
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:39,359
the the myth of cubing or like the myth

2340
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:41,460
of cubing and back Crossing I believe

2341
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:42,899
yeah and it was one of the smartest

2342
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:46,980
papers I've ever read and he actually

2343
01:26:42,899 --> 01:26:48,539
wrote a an addendum to it as well and I

2344
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:50,879
can't remember where it's at but try to

2345
01:26:48,539 --> 01:26:52,380
Google the myth of cubing and back

2346
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,480
Crossing and if I can remember I'll put

2347
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:57,500
it in the description too but it's a

2348
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:59,759
great paper talking about the scientific

2349
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:02,698
uh like what's going on scientifically

2350
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,340
for back Crossing in cannabis

2351
01:27:02,698 --> 01:27:07,319
yeah amazing well we're kind of wrapping

2352
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:08,880
up but I think we did get a related

2353
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:11,939
question to this on like you know

2354
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,159
resources and reading uh Trevor Leahy

2355
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:15,779
from Brita Syndicate asked you know

2356
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:18,059
other girl Bibles that people have

2357
01:27:15,779 --> 01:27:20,399
mentioned countless times like marijuana

2358
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:22,920
botany or marijuana growers guide

2359
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:25,559
uh how reliable and how accurate are

2360
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:28,500
they still and what would you look to

2361
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:31,139
gain from Reading those in 2023

2362
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:33,539
so marijuana botany is not a grow book

2363
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:35,520
by any stretch of the imagination it is

2364
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:37,500
a breeding Theory Book

2365
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,659
and I wouldn't recommend that for

2366
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,679
someone to learn growing however if

2367
01:27:39,658 --> 01:27:43,439
you're going to learn breeding in

2368
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:46,020
cannabis to this day it's still the

2369
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:49,638
standard granted Robert Mark has come

2370
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:52,020
out with a new book called marijuana

2371
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:54,600
ethnobotany and evolution written with

2372
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:57,179
Mark Merlin which is now the standard

2373
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,920
but it is a heavy Collegiate textbook it

2374
01:27:57,179 --> 01:28:01,380
is not meant for someone trying to just

2375
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,719
learn cannabis breeding it's not a good

2376
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:06,119
introduction it is heavy so marijuana is

2377
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:08,039
a more theoretical less practical is

2378
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:10,380
that what you're saying No it's it's

2379
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:12,779
more it's just thicker reading you have

2380
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:15,239
to really understand breeding Concepts

2381
01:28:12,779 --> 01:28:17,960
and breeding terms to jump into the mark

2382
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:17,959
Merlin buff

2383
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:24,420
you have some of that um knowledge yeah

2384
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:27,899
it's okay the best way to put it like if

2385
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:29,460
you've been through some science in a a

2386
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:32,339
junior college

2387
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,139
that book might be more for you the the

2388
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:35,100
marijuana ethnobotany and evolution if

2389
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:37,560
you're comfortable reading college

2390
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:40,020
textbooks that's how it's written like a

2391
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:43,860
college textbook that book's for you

2392
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:45,659
marijuana botany is more for someone who

2393
01:28:43,859 --> 01:28:47,698
doesn't read college textbooks but wants

2394
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:48,899
to understand breeding Theory at its

2395
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:53,238
basics

2396
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:53,238
yeah as far as growing

2397
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:58,859
the like the Jorge Cervantes grow book

2398
01:28:56,039 --> 01:29:00,420
and you know the Mel Frank one a lot of

2399
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:03,559
people started out on that and it did a

2400
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:06,719
lot of people a lot of good however

2401
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:09,539
growing's come so far so far even in the

2402
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:12,000
past 10 years it's Leaps and Bounds how

2403
01:29:09,539 --> 01:29:14,060
how people have been able to

2404
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,340
um get cannabis to perform and express

2405
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:19,860
is Leaps and Bounds like if you look at

2406
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:21,840
the old Scentsy catalogs for seeds you

2407
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:24,658
see stuff being stuffed with nitrogen to

2408
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:28,020
the gills just poofy no resin nothing

2409
01:29:24,658 --> 01:29:30,359
today we understand how to grow plants a

2410
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:33,480
lot better and I think

2411
01:29:30,359 --> 01:29:34,799
maybe those old books while they are

2412
01:29:33,479 --> 01:29:36,718
great to have in your pocket for

2413
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,520
understanding some of cannabis and

2414
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,800
knowing like the pest stuff and knowing

2415
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,719
what to look for for like deficiencies

2416
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,760
and how the leaves look

2417
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,980
um those are great but as far as

2418
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,960
learning how to feed there are so many

2419
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:50,579
more advanced courses now from different

2420
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,500
universities on the best way to feed

2421
01:29:50,579 --> 01:29:55,460
cannabis and how it likes organic

2422
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,899
feeding there's also the revs

2423
01:29:55,460 --> 01:30:00,179
tree living Organics book for people

2424
01:29:57,899 --> 01:30:02,399
that want to get into TLO

2425
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:04,679
um but yeah I mean like there's online

2426
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:07,138
courses from from universities on

2427
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:09,239
YouTube that are so much more advanced

2428
01:30:07,139 --> 01:30:11,760
on soil science and and soil biology

2429
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:13,738
that could really really

2430
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,239
like Advanced people's growing

2431
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:16,559
understanding I think that was probably

2432
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:18,059
where I would recommend starting as

2433
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,360
opposed to those books but those books

2434
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:23,219
are great Foundation but for modern

2435
01:30:20,359 --> 01:30:24,658
techniques some of the colleges and

2436
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:26,460
universities are just doing the most

2437
01:30:24,658 --> 01:30:28,079
groundbreaking stuff with soil science

2438
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:30,300
and soil biology

2439
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:34,139
yeah I got you

2440
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:35,279
okay well we are in this final section

2441
01:30:34,139 --> 01:30:37,380
of

2442
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:38,340
um essentially Community questions that

2443
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:40,440
didn't

2444
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:42,600
necessarily fit into any of our previous

2445
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:44,099
sections okay and I think one thing I

2446
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:46,079
want to signpost is that some of these

2447
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:48,780
are more on the breeding side and and

2448
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:51,119
like meh Matt presented a couple of

2449
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:52,859
really rich dense nuggets for breeding

2450
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:54,300
but this episode was mostly about seed

2451
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:56,939
making so I think we also want to keep

2452
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:59,940
open the possibility of having a

2453
01:30:56,939 --> 01:31:02,039
dedicated episode on breeding uh yeah I

2454
01:30:59,939 --> 01:31:04,019
agree uh where we maybe talk more about

2455
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:05,939
like each generation and all that but I

2456
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:07,920
think it's important to to go back over

2457
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:09,960
and redo that one

2458
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,239
yeah I think so yeah so we could

2459
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,679
definitely do that but for in in the

2460
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:16,198
interest of like just answering a few

2461
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:18,060
more of these questions to wrap up

2462
01:31:16,198 --> 01:31:21,960
um some of these are pretty interesting

2463
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:24,360
um loyger from Syndicate asks what

2464
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,639
traits do you lose When selecting from

2465
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:28,859
small plants for example you can't

2466
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,359
select for outdoor plant structure large

2467
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:32,939
plant structure if you're growing in one

2468
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:35,579
gallon pots but you know are there any

2469
01:31:32,939 --> 01:31:38,819
other traits that get lost if you uh

2470
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:41,340
search hunting through smaller plants if

2471
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:44,099
you're heading through smaller plants um

2472
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:46,860
some pest resistance maybe might get

2473
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:48,480
lost in the smaller plants or I mean

2474
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:50,460
they may even get attacked more you

2475
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,718
never know you know

2476
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:55,139
um

2477
01:31:51,719 --> 01:31:56,639
obviously structure yield comes into

2478
01:31:55,139 --> 01:31:58,679
play

2479
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:01,020
um seeing how far because imagine not

2480
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:03,658
all plants sorry to interrupt but I

2481
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:05,520
guess in terms of yield it would be that

2482
01:32:03,658 --> 01:32:07,799
like even though your plant yields x

2483
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,080
amount at in a one gallon pot it doesn't

2484
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:12,060
necessarily scale in a linear fashion if

2485
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:14,819
you go out exactly pot size right yeah

2486
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:16,080
exactly and um

2487
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:17,579
I mean

2488
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:20,039
there are certain things that I think

2489
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:22,559
you can learn about your plant better

2490
01:32:20,039 --> 01:32:24,479
from smaller pot sizes versus just

2491
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:28,580
blowing it out and having the biggest

2492
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:30,779
yielding plant you can which is terpenes

2493
01:32:28,579 --> 01:32:32,880
expression you can see a finer

2494
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:34,319
expression of the plant

2495
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,480
um I believe in like a two or three

2496
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:38,460
gallon pot you can see like so it's not

2497
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:40,979
being pushed too hard in any One

2498
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,779
Direction but it's enough root space for

2499
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:44,218
it to perform

2500
01:32:42,779 --> 01:32:45,779
um but yeah you're obviously going to

2501
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:48,119
lose out on structure especially if

2502
01:32:45,779 --> 01:32:50,099
you're going indoor versus out they're

2503
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:52,019
just way too different

2504
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,179
um like I'm not a proficient outdoor

2505
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:57,120
grower at all I'm an indoor grower and

2506
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:59,579
exclusively indoor my outdoor runs have

2507
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:01,380
been minimal and not even that great you

2508
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:03,658
know so

2509
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:05,279
yeah and I did want to kind of um draw

2510
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:07,379
attention to the one of those points he

2511
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:08,698
made which is that um on terpenes and

2512
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:11,279
maybe like

2513
01:33:08,698 --> 01:33:13,138
uh cannabinoid balance uh chemical

2514
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:15,420
compound balance in general does change

2515
01:33:13,139 --> 01:33:17,400
with scale yeah absolutely I know you

2516
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,960
all have like mentioned that what is it

2517
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:21,179
like the blue dream at different

2518
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,239
different scales performing very

2519
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:25,739
differently for example UK cheese you

2520
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,178
know you can get a thousand expressions

2521
01:33:25,738 --> 01:33:28,738
from that plant you know I've told

2522
01:33:27,179 --> 01:33:31,380
stories about how I've thrown away the

2523
01:33:28,738 --> 01:33:32,879
same clone several different times that

2524
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,260
smelled different because I thought it

2525
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:38,100
was a fake cut because it didn't smell

2526
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:39,480
like my my first smoking of cheese and

2527
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:41,400
then later on when I grew it a certain

2528
01:33:39,479 --> 01:33:43,079
way it's like oh this is the same Berry

2529
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:45,238
plant but now it smells like cheese what

2530
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:46,559
the hell you know that's you know that's

2531
01:33:45,238 --> 01:33:48,299
one of the most important things I've

2532
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,400
ever learned in cannabis

2533
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:52,440
um was the plasticity of cannabis and

2534
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:55,319
how truly different it is and how hard

2535
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:59,460
it is to identify clones and different

2536
01:33:55,319 --> 01:34:03,179
plants in flower through pictures

2537
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:05,219
yeah you know that's very rare

2538
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:08,880
it comes back to that my earlier point

2539
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:12,239
that like of course you know we want to

2540
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:13,920
try to seek out as many Clues as

2541
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,619
possible

2542
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:18,539
um in advance of

2543
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:20,460
uh

2544
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:21,359
flowering something out or breeding

2545
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,639
something

2546
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:25,738
um you know we're looking there's this

2547
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:28,260
tendency to look for

2548
01:34:25,738 --> 01:34:30,238
um science right yeah wherever they are

2549
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:31,440
and it is interesting it's an

2550
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:32,698
interesting game and that leads on to

2551
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:36,198
the next question

2552
01:34:32,698 --> 01:34:38,879
from Morris uh it's an interesting one

2553
01:34:36,198 --> 01:34:42,419
uh do you think that there are traits

2554
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:45,060
that tend to be overlooked in selections

2555
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:46,859
um so we know that the most common ones

2556
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:51,780
are going to be like

2557
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:53,579
um structure flavor smell potency

2558
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:55,920
um mold resistance you know those are

2559
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:57,658
obviously really common ones are there

2560
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,279
ones you think

2561
01:34:57,658 --> 01:35:02,939
are overlooked they're maybe a bit more

2562
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:05,639
minor but also quite important hi

2563
01:35:02,939 --> 01:35:08,099
is the most important to me and it's not

2564
01:35:05,639 --> 01:35:10,020
the most important to everyone but in

2565
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:11,699
the during the Instagram era I really

2566
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:13,739
feel like that's been the most ignored

2567
01:35:11,698 --> 01:35:16,500
because you can't visually see it

2568
01:35:13,738 --> 01:35:18,178
you can't pick it fast

2569
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:19,979
you know like you can't tell which plant

2570
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:21,420
has the best high really fast you know

2571
01:35:19,979 --> 01:35:23,039
like while it's in flour how are you

2572
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:24,000
going to do that

2573
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:25,979
um

2574
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,359
that's definitely one of the main ones

2575
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:29,099
because it's just not something our

2576
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,139
senses really pick up until we smoke it

2577
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:34,079
and it takes time

2578
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:36,900
um to properly like test and smoke a

2579
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:38,158
whole crop of like 50 selections takes

2580
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:39,960
even more time

2581
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:41,819
and

2582
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,899
and how much time you wanted to vote to

2583
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:44,819
that and how much space you put in

2584
01:35:42,899 --> 01:35:46,920
between each

2585
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:49,139
sampling of each high and what you're

2586
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,219
doing the mindset and set like all come

2587
01:35:49,139 --> 01:35:52,079
into play

2588
01:35:50,219 --> 01:35:54,600
so yeah I mean

2589
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:57,179
I don't know kind of rambling but

2590
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,920
no I get it and I think it's this is a

2591
01:35:57,179 --> 01:35:59,699
difficult question because like

2592
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:02,520
um

2593
01:35:59,698 --> 01:36:04,198
I know for example I think not so has

2594
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,880
mentioned this like an interesting one

2595
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:09,899
that I don't know many people think

2596
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:12,239
about is that they may be a sweet spot

2597
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:13,500
for say flower density

2598
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:15,599
yeah

2599
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:17,460
um where it's like oh actually if it's

2600
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,679
too dense it doesn't smoke well if it's

2601
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:21,420
too loose then it's too loose right so

2602
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,158
maybe there's something in there but I

2603
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:24,899
think generally the main things that

2604
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:27,238
people select for it's pretty well

2605
01:36:24,899 --> 01:36:30,238
covered right and well there's also

2606
01:36:27,238 --> 01:36:32,218
there's also selecting against and

2607
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:35,299
people are selected against an intersex

2608
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:38,520
trait and I think that that's also

2609
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:40,619
detrimental the Cannabis because there

2610
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:42,300
are things called link traits and some

2611
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:44,099
of the times those linked traits might

2612
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:45,960
be linked to that intersex trait and

2613
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:48,659
some of those may be traits like you

2614
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:51,119
know heavy volatile sulfur compounds

2615
01:36:48,658 --> 01:36:52,259
that smell skunky and we may have lost a

2616
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,819
lot of that because people selected

2617
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:56,280
against an intersex trait that's linked

2618
01:36:53,819 --> 01:36:58,679
I mean that's one Theory you know um so

2619
01:36:56,279 --> 01:37:01,380
there are there are many traits that we

2620
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:02,639
select against that maybe maybe we are

2621
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:04,380
considering it but we're selecting

2622
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,760
against it and it may be hurting the

2623
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:08,819
overall gene pool

2624
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:11,579
oh that just blows open the degree of

2625
01:37:08,819 --> 01:37:13,679
complexity here where yeah yeah you may

2626
01:37:11,579 --> 01:37:15,960
be yeah implicitly in selecting for

2627
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:17,460
something you may uh sorry in select

2628
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,899
before something you maybe implicitly

2629
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:20,760
say selecting against something else

2630
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:21,839
that you don't even know about that's

2631
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,760
kind of

2632
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,679
that's kind of mind-blowing and that's

2633
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,880
why the progeny has to be run that's why

2634
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,800
it's so important to run the project

2635
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:30,539
yeah because you just never truly know

2636
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,539
like with the for example with the blue

2637
01:37:30,539 --> 01:37:35,519
bonnet male the first the first thing

2638
01:37:33,539 --> 01:37:39,300
that I used to select him was because

2639
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:41,880
was his purple stock stripes and and

2640
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:43,860
just like the overall look because I I

2641
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,020
remember DJ's blueberry mother clone

2642
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:48,059
that has somewhat of a blueberry smell

2643
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:49,020
and some of the other blue selections

2644
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,580
that I made over the years that are kind

2645
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:52,800
of blueberry muffin all have this look

2646
01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:54,899
to it and this particular one had his

2647
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,219
his leaves sticking 90 degrees from top

2648
01:37:54,899 --> 01:37:57,420
to bottom all the lesions sticking

2649
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:59,698
straight up so I was like okay that's

2650
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:03,119
that's like him raising his hands that's

2651
01:37:59,698 --> 01:38:04,379
as good as any thing using the you know

2652
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:06,479
what little education I have with

2653
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:08,579
blueberry those specific traits that

2654
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,919
identified visually and then that I was

2655
01:38:08,579 --> 01:38:13,559
like okay well this is as good as any to

2656
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:15,000
try then when I when I when I was

2657
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:16,980
dusting the room when I was smacking the

2658
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,600
mail I remember I had on this big face

2659
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:20,759
mask with the canisters on it usually

2660
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:22,920
you can't smell much of scent through

2661
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,079
that thing but I was smelling nothing

2662
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:26,579
but Berry coming through when he was

2663
01:38:25,079 --> 01:38:30,000
wafting around so at that point I knew

2664
01:38:26,579 --> 01:38:32,939
that he at least has oils that that have

2665
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,079
a berry smell to them so that's a plus

2666
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:37,259
but

2667
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:38,698
even with all that I had no clue if he

2668
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:40,679
was really going to pass that blueberry

2669
01:38:38,698 --> 01:38:44,158
trait until I ran the progeny there's

2670
01:38:40,679 --> 01:38:46,260
just no way to know because in in using

2671
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:48,119
that purple stripe stock maybe even

2672
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:50,719
though he smells blueberry combining it

2673
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:53,579
with whatever potential females I have

2674
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:55,079
that trait on that plant locks out that

2675
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:56,460
Berry trait so you'll never see it you

2676
01:38:55,079 --> 01:38:58,679
know there's all kinds of things to take

2677
01:38:56,460 --> 01:39:01,319
into account when it comes

2678
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:03,000
yeah yeah so I guess the upshot from

2679
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:04,019
from there is we're not trying to say

2680
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,020
that like

2681
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:10,800
you can't use try to use early earlier

2682
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:12,960
indicators to help you narrow your

2683
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,880
search but just you have to know that

2684
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,399
there's no Silver Bullet and there's no

2685
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,260
replacement for actually running

2686
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:21,599
something out or it's progeny out sorry

2687
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:23,880
I should say yeah um they're no

2688
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:26,400
shortcuts no Silver Bullet no shortcuts

2689
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:28,260
and and there's no shortcuts better than

2690
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:29,819
knowing the line and running the progeny

2691
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:31,739
knowing what you're working with is

2692
01:39:29,819 --> 01:39:34,380
super important so even if you haven't

2693
01:39:31,738 --> 01:39:37,678
you know bred with it let's say you've

2694
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:39,600
run you know 10 clones from that same

2695
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,340
line per year you'll know more about

2696
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,020
that line and its traits and its

2697
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,819
different Expressions just from running

2698
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:47,100
those 10 different plants from that line

2699
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:49,198
over a year then you've realized so when

2700
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,639
you go on on to do this the breeding

2701
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:52,319
work with it you'll be like oh wait I

2702
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:54,440
know that trait I saw that you know

2703
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:57,299
clone number three and blah blah blah

2704
01:39:54,439 --> 01:39:58,919
all that comes into play and helps and

2705
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:00,659
people don't really realize it until

2706
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,800
after they're doing the progeny

2707
01:40:00,658 --> 01:40:03,119
selection and that's when you start

2708
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,980
realizing

2709
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:07,019
all that time you spent learning those

2710
01:40:04,979 --> 01:40:09,959
plants really like how important it is

2711
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:11,580
When selecting traits it's so important

2712
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:14,100
yep yep

2713
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:17,340
yep great advice

2714
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:20,159
okay well we have a final question

2715
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:22,800
um also from loyger are there any

2716
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:25,500
differences between breeding short and

2717
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,000
long flowering strengths

2718
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:28,198
yes

2719
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,539
um

2720
01:40:28,198 --> 01:40:32,939
that's that's another multi-tiered

2721
01:40:30,539 --> 01:40:34,738
complex thing I mean it can go

2722
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:36,839
from like you know to where Neville was

2723
01:40:34,738 --> 01:40:38,698
saying like don't use Hayes males only

2724
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:40,679
use Haze females because the haze males

2725
01:40:38,698 --> 01:40:42,119
breed like trash you know that like

2726
01:40:40,679 --> 01:40:44,579
people have these theories like that but

2727
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:45,840
overall when it gets to Basics the main

2728
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:47,639
difference is going to be flower time

2729
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,840
and when you pollinate when you

2730
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:51,119
pollinate

2731
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:54,119
um how long the seeds take to mature and

2732
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:55,859
how long you know the the the male

2733
01:40:54,119 --> 01:40:57,300
flowers versus the female flowers and

2734
01:40:55,859 --> 01:40:59,158
when they're going to go off that's the

2735
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:02,219
main considerations When taking into

2736
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:04,559
account seed making specifically

2737
01:41:02,219 --> 01:41:07,139
nice

2738
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:10,320
okay well you know I think that's that's

2739
01:41:07,139 --> 01:41:12,359
us we covered uh the sequence you know

2740
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:14,880
the specific techniques and steps of

2741
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:16,738
making seeds for regulars reversals

2742
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,920
autos

2743
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:22,738
um we covered some of the

2744
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:25,380
questions around isolation contamination

2745
01:41:22,738 --> 01:41:28,019
prevention overall pretty you know

2746
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:30,060
pretty uh pessimistic risk-averse

2747
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:32,520
response which yeah makes sense I think

2748
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:36,239
my responses most of my responses are

2749
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:38,580
going to be like uh risk averse and with

2750
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:41,039
sterility and like cleanliness in mind

2751
01:41:38,579 --> 01:41:42,420
when it comes to breeding I think yeah

2752
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:44,519
yeah

2753
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:46,079
and finally at the end we got to gesture

2754
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:47,760
towards

2755
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:51,000
um some actual breeding strategy and

2756
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:53,460
techniques uh sorry strategy and Theory

2757
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,039
um and maybe we will do another episode

2758
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:58,618
that's dedicated to breeding yeah I
