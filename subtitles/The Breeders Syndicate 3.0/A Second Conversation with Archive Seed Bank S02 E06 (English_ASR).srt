[Music]

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,519
so

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,518
[Music]

6
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,479
welcome to breeder syndicate

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:49,920
[Music]

8
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,280
yeah i don't know how to do this [ __ ]

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,679
you got it

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,480
does that work yep that's perfect dude

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,399
cool

12
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,799
all right how are you doing today

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,399
pretty good oh itself uh good they had

14
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,238
some good questions at first um do you

15
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
know about any of the history of trinity

16
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,640
the cut that's going around

17
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,798
uh just that it came out of eugene

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,320
really um

19
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
i don't really know anything else other

20
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,118
than that the one that i've seen

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
recently

22
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,640
uh does not remind me of what i used to

23
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:22,399
buy out of eugene that's interesting

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,400
it's a lot then the more recent thing is

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,040
more a lot more modern

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
sweet smelling yeah and i just remember

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,520
that all the trinity that i ever saw

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,600
even though like different um

29
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,359
phenos uh

30
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,640
or whatever you know whatever jars of

31
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,640
weed that were coming around like were

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,799
called trinity it always was burnt

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,680
rubber yeah it was

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,840
roadkill it was burnt rubber so

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,600
yeah the newest trinity um a lot of them

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,759
have like dud branches and i ended up

37
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,879
with one of the [ __ ] dud branches and

38
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,680
it uh

39
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,718
yeah it spreads pretty quick

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,280
so yeah that uh

41
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,239
especially if you're not um

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
keeping the [ __ ] uh

43
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,438
um

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,840
the dunning likes to proliferate in low

45
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,719
light yeah

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,080
so absolutely dude and fungus gnats seem

47
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,239
to be a vector

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
yeah yeah i've heard that in uh aphids

49
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,759
and thrips

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
yeah pretty much anything that like

51
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,359
chews on your uh

52
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,280
shoes on your plants is probably going

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,520
to be a pretty good vector for it and

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,959
particular shoes on your roots also yeah

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
it's it's one of those has like the

56
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,920
[ __ ] rubbery stems with no texture

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
three flowers everywhere you know

58
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,958
yeah totally ugly [ __ ] things all

59
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,318
right

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,878
here's a good question who's your

61
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,199
favorite breeder dude

62
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,199
um

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,800
i don't know i mean

64
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,959
for me it's it's just there's good

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,200
varieties that you know my favorite

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,640
breeder is accidental herming how about

67
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,079
that

68
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,799
yeah did you have a breeder you looked

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,360
up to when you first started though

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,360
um

71
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,878
no in particular i was just a seed buyer

72
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,878
i wasn't like

73
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,280
i don't um

74
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,959
i don't idolize people that much you

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,239
know so it wasn't really like about the

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,759
person so much to me as it was just uh

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,920
the product that came out of it that was

78
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,799
it yeah a lot of the people that i got

79
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,280
into i immediately regretted once i met

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
him you know like like dj short and some

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,959
other people like they just don't want

82
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,639
to talk about [ __ ]

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
yeah and i had the benefit of having

84
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,359
like met a lot of those people early in

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,039
my career or have run across them uh

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,599
with the seattle hemp fest stuff and all

87
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,798
that kind of [ __ ] so um

88
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,238
you know

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,519
what's that saying about like not

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
meeting your heroes because they might

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,158
not

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
stand up to the standard you have in

93
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,318
your mind or whatever you know

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,598
so for me it to me it wasn't so much

95
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,039
about the person it was what kind of

96
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,518
work you're doing and what are the

97
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,280
results from it that's it yeah i think

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,120
that's that's a pretty smart answer too

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
because a lot of people are dicks that

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,959
do good work

101
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,200
right and you know i'm here for the

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,598
genetics i don't really care about

103
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,199
who you are it it really has nothing to

104
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,560
do with it for me personally yeah

105
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,958
what are you what are your thoughts on

106
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,719
the whole filos thing going down where

107
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,280
what did you think

108
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,439
at all does it matter

109
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,680
i mean i think a lot of people are have

110
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,918
miss uh

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,280
misguided attention

112
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,560
right

113
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,319
um

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,160
you know they don't really have that

115
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,800
much data you know they have short

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,800
sequence genome testing right

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
and if you lift listen to kevin's [ __ ]

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,960
he you know he's much more

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
um knowledgeable about the whole type

120
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,918
hold the science behind it than anything

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,520
so

122
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,799
um

123
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,079
for me it was just like uh

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
you know what are they really gonna be

125
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,439
able to do with it anyways and

126
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,680
they

127
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,360
like a bunch of my stuff is in their

128
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
galaxy that i didn't send in because

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
they were they're able to just go

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,680
purchase the product oh yeah um and put

131
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,240
it in that so like how you know

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,120
what are you really gonna do right not

133
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,720
not

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,959
not only can you not send them the

135
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,720
product and all these other things but

136
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,839
you can't have your product on the shelf

137
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
somewhere because they can just buy it

138
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,959
put the [ __ ] stem in and then send do

139
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,038
their short sequence analysis so

140
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,319
what um

141
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,839
you know

142
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,439
what are you gonna do to stop it even if

143
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,359
there were even if they even if they

144
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,759
were

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,038
legitimate about it or weren't

146
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
what difference is it going to make they

147
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,759
can still acquire all the data that they

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,600
want anyways so the short sequence data

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,199
yeah i think kevin said it best dude

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,439
like when you it broke it down explain

151
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,439
how it works

152
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,439
uh kevin from um medicinal genomics when

153
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,240
he broke it down and explained how it

154
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,839
works that like he ran uh their data

155
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,280
through his software and it just dumped

156
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,198
everything out as invalid um

157
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,038
sure yeah i think people

158
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,280
are missing the main main points yeah

159
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,038
they lied we all get that they didn't

160
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,758
yeah that's the only thing but so so

161
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,000
does 95 of everybody else that exists in

162
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,000
this space too yeah you know that's

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,680
that's why i call out so many people is

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,519
because there's

165
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,319
blatant evidence it's not even me just

166
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,758
like

167
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,199
making [ __ ] up there's high times

168
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,520
articles where they [ __ ] admit to

169
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,280
this [ __ ] yeah it's like what else

170
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,839

mad farmer's family or not

i haven't really read into it but i find

180
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,180
it highly

181
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,279
uh unlikely

182
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,000
[Laughter]

183
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,478
yeah i mean it's it's probably the same

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,439
odds as crippy coming from kawaii yeah

185
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,639

or what other

187
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,800
20 different [ __ ] up stories that

188
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,239
someone has made up in the last 10 years

189
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,918
that is obvious [ __ ] that some

190
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
for some reason people perpetuate i

191
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,000
don't even know yeah i have no idea the

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,199
same reason we still hear [ __ ] og

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,439
kush is what kim [ __ ] lemon thai

yeah the ocean grown story it's like how

195
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,959
many times do like

196
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,639
how many people have to say how shity

197
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,799
that person is for people to stop

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,560
believing

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,879
all right here we go uh what do you know

200
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,038
about the organ funk and or blue dots do

201
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,319
you have any experience with them

202
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:33,598
blue dot like i said last time was a a

203
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,800
cut down the bay area and um

204
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,279
uh

205
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,879
what was the other one um uh working

206
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,679
funk

207
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,680
i never saw oregon funk yeah

208
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,879
how do you feel about the josh d story

209
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,079
i mean every

210
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,280
person that i know that got og back then

211
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,719
it all leads back to josh yeah so

212
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,959
it's you know

213
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
from my perspective it's as legitimate

214
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,959
as it comes

215
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,079
everybody traces back to him yeah

216
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,680
yep

217
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,519
i think that's the one of the only few

218
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,439
people that actually can has everybody

219
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,959
traced back to him that wasn't 100 full

220
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,560
of [ __ ]

221
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,120
and i i saw

222
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,319
pictures uh like the na the film

223
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,598
negatives

224
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,240
from josh of him and matt and then the

225
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,360
next picture in the film negatives is

226
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,680
og kush right it's it's i mean the plant

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,240
is really easy to identify once you know

228
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,080
and so it's it's pretty obvious to me

229
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,320
that um

230
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,759
they got more evidence of having it back

231
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,360
in the late 90s than anybody else i've

232
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,038
ever met yep

233
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
what do you feel was your most left on

234
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,838
release

235
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,879
um

236
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,200
i don't know i mean

237
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,720
you know certain stuff you just expect

238
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,879
to move slow because it doesn't have a

239
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
brand name i mean dog [ __ ] crosses even

240
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,759
as popular as it was back in

241
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,679
the northwest back in the day

242
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,559
i guess the name doesn't translate well

243
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:05,679
yeah yeah i could see that dude the cat

244
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:09,599

245
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,958

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
um

247
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,958
the name was always really popular man

248
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,799
the san diego cactus is a [ __ ] legend

249

00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,679
[Music]

288
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,000
a real similar bud structure it got it

289
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,159
would turn purple on the tops um and it

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,958
just had that like sw really sweet

291

yeah i always thought that was

296
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,679
interesting with urquell is it as it as

297
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,278
it grows like when it's first in bloom

298
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,679
it's really skunky and you wouldn't

299
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,399
expect it to turn grapey at the end

300
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:12,719
yeah if you grow it right um

301
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,679
it can finish pretty skunky too wow

302
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,079
erkel and manic both

303
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,919

00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:24,958
eternal love afghan anyone ran it

305
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,399
i have no idea yeah i i actually have

306
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,639
i've run it

307
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,200
it's uh it's it's a good afghan but it's

308
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,319
not skunky it's not anything uh it

309
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,680
wasn't what i was looking for

310
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,560
what's yeah what's your rules on

311
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,559
breeding with your gear

312
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,240
oh i mean it's not about my year or

313
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
their year or whatever it's just put in

314
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,919
some work so that we have

315
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,679
differentiation between

316
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,120
people's selections in their lines so if

317
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,399
you're not putting any selections and

318
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,679
then what are you really doing you're

319
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,519
just

320
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,120
putting more of the same thing into the

321
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,959
gene pool yeah

322
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,639
and poor and poorly selected that if you

323
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,599
didn't do any um

324
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,519
uh

325
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
didn't do any selection work yeah if

326
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
it's just popping the pack of seeds and

327
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,559
picking the first female yeah

328
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,000
right you could get really lucky or you

329
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,838
could just be proliferating a bunch of

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,879
garbage under the same name and now it's

331
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,480
either diluting the original work

332
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,919
or

333
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
maybe it maybe makes it better in

334
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,479
certain cases but in most cases it

335
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,720
doesn't

336
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,278
yeah

337
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,320
is it true lumpa farms split up

338
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,720
who cares um

339
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
let's see what we got uh it's got to be

340
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,720
better questions than that

341
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,720
wasn't alien the breeder of fruity

342
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,120
pebbles og

343
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,720
yeah i'm pretty sure alien genetics was

344
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,159
what else we got

345
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,879
did you ever find anything worth

346
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,838
worthwhile in the dutch flower stuff

347
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,838
uh nope

348
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,560
all right what was your first uh strain

349
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:54,159
that you sold man

350
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,879
uh probably the 32 line yeah 32 what's

351
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,838
that yeah the albert walker manic line

352
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,958
cros albert walker manic male crossed

353
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,680
with

354
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,278
uh sauerkush um

355
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,039
i don't think i sold any albert walker

356
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,639
bx ones but

357
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:12,879
uh sauerkush original diesel

358
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,079
uh master kush

359
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,919
um

360
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,359
a couple other things can't remember did

361
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,199
you are you pretty good about keeping

362
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
back stock and stuff and and preserving

363
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,959
you're like preserving your own lines

364
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,759
and holding back stock of it

365
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,359
yeah i have everything wow

366
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,879
that's something i have every seed of

367
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,320
everything that's ever been made i have

368
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,360
thousands of seeds of everything that's

369
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
ever made

370
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,039
really

371
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,958
that that i made yeah i'm gonna have to

372
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,719
blow you for something then all right uh

373
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,119
and then i just um

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,360
i just popped pretty much all the old

375
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,919
seeds that i have from 15 years ago and

376
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,159
that's it that's awesome

377
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,639
and so all i have left is just seeds

378
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,639
that i've made

379
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,240
see

380
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,838
archive has very gassy chirps what other

381
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,600
flavor profiles do you feel you have

382
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
dialed in aside from gassy

383
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,079
that's pretty much what i breed for

384
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,759
skunky i mean you know every every other

385
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:10,958
flavor out there

386
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,958
um but has to be skunky you know yeah

387
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,039
what's your fastest finishing release

388
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,039
um

389
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,440
probably a shark bite but i don't think

390
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,278
i've put any of that in

391
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
a while

392
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,639
let's get some strain history questions

393
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,320
come on y'all

394
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,839
super dangerous this guy keeps asking

395
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
about super dave genetics i don't even

396
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,360
know what that is to you

397
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
uh he's just a dude up here in

398
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
washington i don't i don't know

399
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
i i don't know a whole lot about him or

400
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,240
haven't seen a lot of his work yeah it's

401
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,839
hard to comment on [ __ ] like that

402
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,879
why do i think the bland [ __ ] becomes

403
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,680
popular

404
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,600
it's because people because the whole

405
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,679
world is turning into a

406
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,639
consumed by visual

407
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,519
market marketing right so if it looks

408
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,000
good

409
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,240
it sell it people want to buy it you

410
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
know

411
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,240
even though the vast majority of really

412
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,439
really tasty strains

413
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,079
don't look the best because you're

414
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,880
selecting for terpenes and flavor not

415
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,319
for

416
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,159
visual appeal

417
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
and and when no one was taking pictures

418
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,719
of the bag a week because they didn't

419
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,519
want to get busted

420
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,879
uh

421
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,278
the best selling point was what it

422
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,480
smelled like when it opened up yep

423
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,399
when you opened up a bag

424
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,399
did we cover albert walker last time

425
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
where it originated from i don't think

426
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,720
we did um

427
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,440
maybe i'm not sure

428
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,440
yes uh i don't think we did maybe

429
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
yeah

430
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,679
i got it from

431
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,560
my buddy uh cannabis reverend up here

432
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,719
and uh he um

433
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,719
got it from this other kid who got it

434
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,399
from the old timer

435
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,639
and that dude lived like an hour and a

436
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,480
half away we were just uh

437
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,720
buying the herb back then

438
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,519
uh canvas reverend happened to get a cut

439
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
one time uh i think he took it down to

440
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,320
oregon lost it

441
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,560
uh and then reacquired it again um this

442
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,839
is like 2003

443
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,758
probably

444
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,000
yeah 2003

445
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,680
and uh

446
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
like 10 years later

447
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,599
the the guy that we got the cut from he

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,240
hit me uh or like i guess it was like

449
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,399
2013 or yeah like 10 years

450
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,159
he hit me up as the medical scene

451
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,879
started uh coming on was like i'm the

452
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,039
one that gave that to your buddy right

453
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,799
um and he knew all the same people so

454
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,838
it's obviously him and we sat down and

455
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:41,838
had some beers and uh he said that it

456
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,360
came from a uh electrician plumber dude

457
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,800
that was uh i think it was in the

458
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,879
portland area or like vancouver

459
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,599
washington

460
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,039
and he had moved out from iowa or

461
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,879
something like that

462
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,879
and uh when the old timer up here he uh

463
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,799
got the club he got the clone when he

464
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,278
got his electricity and his plumbing

465
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:04,318
done for his grow room like you know 15

466
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,199
20 or 20 years ago like mid 90s late 90s

467
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:06,639
yeah

468
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,798
um

469
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
and uh that's where he had got it from

470
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,160
and then i had another guy come up to me

471
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,959
at uh

472
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,319
uh

473
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,600
emerald cup

474
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,519
and

475
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,399
he said that uh he was the one that

476
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,599
popped the seed in iowa

477
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,038
and

478
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,798
he was telling me that he had given it

479
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,038
to like three or four people he only

480
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,558
grew it for like six months or a year or

481
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,200
something like that

482
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,200
and he gave it to a few people and one

483
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,120
of those guys moved to

484
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
vancouver washington i think it was

485
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,918
right

486
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,480
so the story's kind of lined up and i i

487
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,799
hadn't given him any information about

488
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,519
what i knew about it um and he said that

489
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:49,359
he had received the seeds

490
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:51,679
uh from the base player of culture right

491
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,119
the reggae band

492
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,640
and that he had popped him and that's

493
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,000
that's what it was

494
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
well he but he didn't know what the

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,720
actual origin of the seeds were like

496
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,679
with the baseline

497
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
old

498
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,400
yeah yeah

499
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,559
that's pretty [ __ ] round though that

500
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,960
it came back so like that

501
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,720
yeah well i mean one of the very few

502
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,200
companies that's working with it right

503
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,558
and is known for for that one and i mean

504
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,720
you know we entered it into the

505
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,918

those guy i mean you know how much of

510
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,720
it's true i don't know exactly i mean

511
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,400
the guy that we got it from i believe

512
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,919
his story because he had nothing to gain

513
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,280
from making anything up and then the guy

514
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,200
that came up that just happened to match

515
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,359
up with the rest of the story so yeah

516
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,200
that's pretty fun bad man

517
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,759
yeah sometimes it works out and you know

518
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,840
our walkers are pretty unique

519
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,160
name so it's uh

520
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,918
it's easy to know if you you are or not

521
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,919
what what you're talking about yeah

522
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,919
absolutely there's a lot of fake albert

523
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,320
walker going around uh

524
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,160
that i remember from san diego

525
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,798
yeah well that was that eight cut from

526
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,400
when uh yeah he got given it and it got

527
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,918
mixed up and then sold it with the wrong

528
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
name and you know that's the one that's

529
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,080
that uh

530
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,918
that cuts equally also good i suppose

531
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,918
because it's been winning stuff down

532
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,600
there yeah called albert walker yeah

533
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,880
that's not bad the [ __ ] walker it's not

534
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,599
bad

535
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,200
it's just totally not albert walker

536
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,719
right

537
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
let's see what else we've got do you

538
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,839
have any other passion strains beside

539
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,558
the skunk or terps besides the skunk

540
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,319

541

well no it just has to have a long

547
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,279
lasting after flavor and that typically

548
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,519
tends to be the stuff that's

549
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,519
either really skunky or really

550
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,079
incense-y one or the other

551
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,960

mazar skywalker with skywalker og

578
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,599

that was the jedi og was the blueberry

580
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,158
one

581
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,158

603
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,480
with the blue ivy og when jay-z had his

604

kid and like you know they always do

605
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
that in l.a whenever when when whitney

606
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,640

00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,918
uh what else was gold humboldt gold was

674
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,759
pretty good that uh

675
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,080
reefer man had or

676
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,879
something gold that they had

677
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,960
uh that that was [ __ ] was pretty good

678
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,440
what was it uh is it the kodiak gold or

679
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,558
is it no it wasn't it wasn't the alaskan

680
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,038
one it was something else it's like

681
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,319
humble or mendocino something gold oh

682
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,720
interesting

683
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,720
um

684
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,200
yeah

685
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,719
if you could change one thing about

686
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,719
docidos what would it be

687
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,839
uh

688
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
i mean there's nothing

689
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,759
no there's good there's good uh

690
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,038
phenotypes and all this in all that

691
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,720
but there's definitely some hermes and

692
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,200
dosito i mean it's like if you've ever

693
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,600
grown ogkb

694
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,759
uh it throws balls on the bottoms it

695
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,240
throws bananas out the tops and it'll

696
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,278
throw clusters inside the colas you know

697
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,200
so

698
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,278
um

699
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,360
just trying to reduce that

700
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,359
uh to as little of an occurrence as

701
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,479
possible is like

702
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,479
put some of the hardest work

703
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,720
so i wish it didn't have that trait so i

704
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,960
didn't have to spend so much time trying

705
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,558
to get that yeah for sure

706
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,240
i get plenty of strong flavor in the

707
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,399
dosey though just the norcal cut that

708
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,240
goes around is kind of a in between for

709
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
everything i it's not even a cut i keep

710
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,839
personally really

711
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,678
there's one dude a smell book had a

712
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,839
[ __ ] killer cut of your dose it was

713
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,440
beautiful beautiful [ __ ] yeah there's a

714
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,879
lot better stuff in the seeds than the

715
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,759
clones that go around but that's a true

716
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,200
with

717
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,440
anything there's probably better wedding

718
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,440
cake seed phenos that go around probably

719
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,009
better of everything because

720
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,159
most of that [ __ ] is um

721
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:00,319
[Music]

722
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,080
small uh

723
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,439
small population selection so you just

724
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,519
gotta you know

725
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,480
absolutely especially from that first

726
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,720
release

727
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,599
how many people yeah and you know

728
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,919
there's it's i mean i've grown so many

729
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,678
[ __ ] seeds over the last 15 years and

730
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,360
there's been hermes in almost every pack

731
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,360
of seeds i've ever grown and the ones

732
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,240
that didn't ever have hermes had super

733
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,759
swag [ __ ] weed yeah so

734
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,120
what you know like what are you gonna

735
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,679
deal with

736
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,599
yeah i don't know i think when people

737
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,440
are good growers they don't really focus

738
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,879
so much on that they just deal with it

739
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,880
you know what i mean like when it comes

740
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,278
to [ __ ] herms and [ __ ]

741
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,520
just handle it

742
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,519
yeah well i mean what do you want swag

743
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,558
weed or or no herms you can't breed for

744
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,400
everything all at once right

745
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,000
i mean what you are trying to do is

746
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,759
reduce the occurrences but it doesn't

747
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,200
matter if you're talking about chem 91

748
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,640
chem 4

749
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,000
uh ogkb cookies sherbet

750
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,159

skittles there if you

752
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,080
stress the original mother plant it'll

753
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,720
hurt right so

754
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,678
how are you going to uh

755
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,079
are you gonna expect anything else

756
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,038
here's a good one um can you talk about

757
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:16,079
the amnesia cut you use

758
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,319
it's uh the amnesia haze cut from uh

759
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,720
um

760
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,639

exactly

763
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:30,079
it's i mean i've seen people call the

764
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,320
same cut it's super lemon haze also yeah

765
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,319
yeah

766
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,240
so what else we got guys

767
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,000
are we ignoring the face-off question or

768
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,359
just not saying no we answered it in the

769
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,119
in the last time me and him did a live

770
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,439
feed that's up on youtube

771
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,439
tyler

772
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,440
how many weeks should sourdy go

773
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,720
10 for sure yeah

774
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,880
as many as you like it where you like it

775
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,159
yeah at least 10. yep ever heard of

776
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,399
ultra i mean that's like the very

777
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,840
earliest you could get it for sure

778
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,519
ever heard of ultraviolet we talked

779
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,599
about that last time

780
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,038
uh yeah that was the purple indigo yeah

781
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,398
face-off cross

782
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:13,839
any of any collabs with other breeders

783
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,839
not really my thing yeah

784
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,479
they're already collabing with me

785
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,759
anyways half the time yeah using your

786
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,599
stuff yeah

787
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,480
so it's cool

788
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,158
cool works either way yep

789
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,720
see what else we got give me some good

790
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,320
uh strain history questions you guys got

791
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,839
is there any strange that you want to

792
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,678
run the history on that you'd like to

793
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,839
like that has some misinformation out

794
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,840
there

795
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,200
um there's got to be so many

796
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,200
yeah probably pretty much everything

797
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,200
yeah

798
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:49,519
yeah i don't know

799
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,520
nothing's coming to mind right now

800
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,240
columbian gold crossed with uh

801
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:57,038
federation seeds romulan

802
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,038
1972 colombian gold

803
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,960
big sur holy weed history i know dude

804
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,558
there's a lot of uh

805
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,880
stories behind that

806
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,480
do you are you familiar with any of them

807
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,039
not i mean i don't have any first-hand

808
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,480
experience you know i really only talk

809
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,000
on the stuff that i was actually there

810
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,880
for you know or have first-hand

811
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,240
experience if it's so and so said so and

812
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,480
so all i can do is tell you what the

813
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,519
story was like the monk from monk named

814
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,679
paul

815
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,759
story like every the same one everybody

816
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,840
else knows yeah exactly

817
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,839
phds did not make strong

818
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,880
oh [ __ ] done made strong uh are you

819
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,359
gonna cross runs is that is that in your

820
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,840
future run stuff

821
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,839
for sure

822
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,200
favorite og cut a favorite og other than

823
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,000
face off

824
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,000
just the original cut if you know

825
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,079
people weren't feminizing [ __ ] back in

826
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,440
the 90s so they

827
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,359
they're not

828
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,640
directly related so if you just take the

829
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,359
oldest cut and feminize it you're going

830
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,200
to get every other clone yep

831
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,240
here's a good one what's the story with

832
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,240
scott's og

833
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,759
uh i gave him a bunch of clones and

834
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,599
that's what he made with it

835
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,038
here you go

836
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,519
are you thinking about collaborating

837
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,919
with ethos anytime soon

838
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,839
i don't even barely know him i met him

839
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,559
like twice

840

that one what he used to call the maui

875
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,200
rain smell it's like a really hazy um

876
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,240
like real tropical

877
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,720
really

878
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,159
cool smell it's just unique right

879
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,399
uh that my buddy's uh hawaii web denica

880
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,200
uh molokai frost cross that i've

881
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,199
selected a pheno of that's in the new

882
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,120
strain that i'm making too

883
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,880
and uh

884
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,798
uh what else did we

885
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,240
pollinate recently

886
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,798
still trying to work the walker into

887
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,000
something better than it but yeah it's

888
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,639
hard that would be i think it's more

889
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,359
than working yeah

890
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,200
um yeah for the old purple indica same

891
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,158
deal you have to hunt through a lot of

892
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,480
them to find improvements really

893
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,200
favorite cut you have right now

894
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,360
i don't know if that'd be easy to answer

895
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,880
i mean that that's why i have so many

896
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,278
cuts is because i don't have a favorite

897
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,278
but i i gotta admit the skittles the way

898
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,558
that thing [ __ ] smells now i mean the

899
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:29,200
first time i saw that um

900
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,200

901
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,120

that's a good one

1039
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,119
[ __ ] a clone that the guy that it's

1040
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,358
named after never had yeah that's

1041

it's gotta be legit dude yeah gotta

1042
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,440

1043
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,280
many people [ __ ] tell me i'm wrong

1044
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,880
about that too it's

1045
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,640
mind-blowing

1046
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,119
i it's it's it's painful nowadays to

1047
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,199
even try to correct people or correct

1048
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,519
even just misinformation i'm trying to

1049
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,919
correct them yeah you're trying to

1050
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,440
correct misinformation from being

1051
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,400
being spread it's like you would think

1052
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,960
that

1053
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,119
the misinformation 20 years ago would

1054
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,199
have been um

1055
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,800
worse because there was the exchange of

1056
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,639
information was really

1057
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,119
poor right yeah

1058
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,799
now it's people are overflowed with so

1059
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,320
much information that

1060
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,519
it's too hard it's like finding needle

1061
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,039
on the haystack finding the real

1062
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,480
information

1063
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,199
yeah it's it's it's a pain in the

1064
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,000
[ __ ] oh that that's what pkg means

1065
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:13,358
that's sort of pure kush ghost

1066
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,358
yeah that's what that's what i thought

1067
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,920
that's why i'm together

1068
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,598
i thought i thought someone had a

1069
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,440
remembered seeing someone trying to call

1070
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,760
it that and i was like yeah that's just

1071
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,280
that's even dumber than calling it ghost

1072
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,560
one kirkush

1073
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,119

um

1076
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,000
problem well maybe maybe that was a hit

1077
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,240
that was a hit it was good it was good

1078
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,639
for out really good for outdoor

1079
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:44,000
our greenhouse are trinity and humbled

1080
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,920
snow related you know any

1081
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,519
they didn't they don't smell related to

1082
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,680
me yeah

1083
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,719
the snow is like that

1084
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:55,118
incense-y kind of smell

1085
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,480
and trinity was uh

1086
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,039
um

1087
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,559
that burnt rubber

1088
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,279
how about sage have you ever found a

1089
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:03,279
good sage

1090
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,440
i've never found a sage that's as good

1091
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,000
as the big sir holy weed cut yeah i

1092
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,559
would agree with that

1093
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,320
i believe adam said he did say that uh

1094
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,320
big sur holy weed wasn't sage right

1095
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,880
that's what it's supposed to be yeah

1096
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,320
yeah it smells like it yeah

1097
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,760
i mean whether or not it's the same cut

1098
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,160
or whatever who knows but it's it

1099
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,440
definitely smells very similar

1100
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:34,480
what are you smoking on right now

1101
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,480
uh docido 18 fresh frozen rosin

1102
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,920
sounds delicious

1103
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,079
yeah

1104
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,720
do you ever ban land raisins land races

1105
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,880
i have all the time yeah or as close as

1106
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,399
we can really get to it nowadays you

1107
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,800
know yeah

1108
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,720
i mean uh the d the dog [ __ ] is pretty

1109
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,680
close to land race it's not pure but

1110
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,358
like when i have worked and grown pure

1111
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,559
land races like we're talking about with

1112
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,119
the uh

1113
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,078
like the ties they're so bad it's like

1114
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,318
it's

1115
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,640
it's too hard to work with and even the

1116
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,880
purple indica is the same thing

1117
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:11,759
is the same issue right it's so

1118
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,760
unhybridized yeah that anytime you cross

1119
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,040
something into it you gotta like

1120
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,480
search through

1121
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,599
a few hundred of them to find an

1122
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,159
improvement

1123
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,800
um because it's it likes to those genes

1124
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:24,719
like to dominate the hybrids

1125
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,160
yeah yeah people don't understand what

1126
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,399
they're getting into when they want like

1127
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,559
newer growers want to run land like real

1128
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,680
land races legit land races you're going

1129
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,519
to get a lot of herms you're going to

1130
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,598
get a lot of [ __ ]

1131
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,199
resinless [ __ ] you know you've got to

1132
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,359
comb through it all you have to

1133
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,719
hybridize it you have to work it for the

1134
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,559
most part

1135
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,000
well everybody expects that like just

1136
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,599
because it's a land race it's going to

1137
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
be more stable or something and i've had

1138
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,000
the exact opposite experience growing

1139
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,920
yeah especially if you're growing land

1140
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,280
races indoor and that's another thing

1141
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,599
people have to keep in mind is like when

1142
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,760
people make selections outdoor

1143
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,000
or in different environments

1144
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,599
so if if you make your selections

1145
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,599
outdoor in a greenhouse right

1146
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,240
if that plant does not hermaphrodite at

1147
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,920
all in those conditions right

1148
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,838
is that a true female or is that a

1149
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,000
hermaphrodite if it hermes when you take

1150
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,000
it inside is that a true female or is it

1151
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,440
a herme right yeah because once you

1152
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,519
change the environment change the

1153
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,000
wavelength of the of the

1154
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,679
light source and everything else

1155
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,679
if you may be inducing the

1156
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,078
hermaphroditic tendencies but in its

1157
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,239
natural environment which is

1158
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,720
outside under the sun

1159
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,719
it's a clean female so so what is the

1160
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,199
sex of that individual is it is it

1161
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,439
actually female or is it a hermaphrodite

1162
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,559
because it hermes indoors but not

1163
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,159
outdoors

1164
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,000
i would think you'd have to apply it to

1165
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,920
outdoor status you know what i mean like

1166
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,679
because that's its natural environment

1167
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,838
everything needs to acclimate to some

1168
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,199
degree but yeah that's that's that's a

1169
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,838
big difference trying to bring something

1170
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:57,919
indoor to outdoor or outdoor to indoor

1171
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,440
well every cannabis plant is outdoor to

1172
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,358
indoor right

1173
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,400
even if it's been hybridized indoors

1174
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,400
still

1175
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,200
carries the same genes of every other

1176
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,480
plant that grows outside yeah and

1177
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,759
i mean

1178
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,318
another thing people have to keep in

1179
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,680
mind like a thousand watt hps at least

1180
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:17,279
historically i don't i don't know about

1181
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,960
the des but i know it's not that uh

1182
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,319
it's probably not that considerably

1183
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,679
different

1184
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,279
uh

1185
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,399
the

1186
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,160
uh thousand watt hps bulb six inches

1187
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,440
from the bulb is one tenth of the

1188
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,039
strength of

1189
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,720
of the sun

1190
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,719
in like the middle of summer right

1191
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,839
so when you are selecting for a plant

1192
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,838
that performs well indoors

1193
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,799
essentially the first criteria that

1194
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:47,358
you're so unknowingly selecting for is

1195
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,720
the plant's ability to

1196
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,880
uh

1197
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,318
turn light into energy right through

1198
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,800
photosynthesis

1199
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:58,880
right well there's a if

1200
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,280
if a plant does not convert that super

1201
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,079
efficiently it won't grow well indoors

1202
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,920
period because it needs the intensity of

1203
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,800
the sun to process the light right yeah

1204
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,599
and

1205
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,160
if as soon as you go indoor with it

1206
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,480
you're already selecting away 90 of the

1207
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,318
plants that don't perform well

1208
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,480
um

1209
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,920
without a full light source right and

1210
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,119
that's why you have lots of varieties

1211
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,000
that when you take them outside they

1212
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,760
actually perform way better again right

1213
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,239
they may be kind of poor growers are

1214
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,800
kind of weak stemmed or some

1215
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:37,039
you know mediocre growth pattern indoors

1216
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,039
same plant outsides a beast right

1217
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,759
and that has nothing to do with like

1218
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,679
quality genetics or

1219
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,599
anything other than the plant's ability

1220
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,199
to process light and how effective how

1221
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,280
efficiently it can do that and whether

1222
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,679
or not i could even do it with a

1223
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,359
fraction of the light available in its

1224
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,799
natural and

1225
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:59,119
evolved environment yeah absolutely

1226
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,440
acclimation's so [ __ ] important

1227
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,160
so important right

1228
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,519
uh so it's just it's just about whether

1229
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,799
or not it can

1230
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,559
and uh it can convert that light energy

1231
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,079
yeah i don't i don't do any breeding for

1232
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,000
outdoors like i don't i don't take my

1233
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,440
plants out acclimate them outdoors see

1234
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,239
how they perform outdoors because i just

1235
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,920
don't have outdoor space

1236
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,838
but i think that's ideal

1237
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,358
especially because uh

1238
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,078
a lot of people during certain seasons

1239
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,159
are only buying for outdoor

1240
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,720
right yeah cool

1241
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:34,000
what is the true og kush chirp profile

1242
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,078
how would you best describe it

1243
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,679
um i always thought it kind of smelled

1244
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,039
tasted like chlorine yeah i get i guess

1245
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,639
like soapy

1246
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,679
cleaner yeah yeah

1247
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,279
yeah yeah it almost smells like a pool

1248
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,480
and uh

1249
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,440
like salt water and real like skunky

1250
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,358
type of smell um

1251
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,358
mainly that like the whole lemon pine

1252
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,119
thing i didn't really ever get that out

1253
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,039
of it i don't pick up i mean it's like

1254
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,280
kind of like that but only because like

1255
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,599
lemon and pine are also cleaner type

1256
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,839
smells as well right

1257
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,599
so yeah i i tend to think that a lot of

1258
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,199
people pick up more lemon from og

1259
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,280
because they associate that with cleaner

1260
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,519
like lemon pine salt and stuff like that

1261
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,960
right yeah yeah exactly

1262
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,199
uh can you talk about cleaning clones

1263
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,119
with ionized water

1264
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,118
i don't know i think i mean ionized

1265
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,519
water isn't anything special yeah i

1266
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,440
don't know anything about that uh

1267
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,880
is there any real milk chocolate tasting

1268
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,400
weed

1269
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,559
um

1270
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,960
[Music]

1271
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:37,679
some old bubba old old bubba

1272
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,679
yeah or old purple indica

1273
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,358
oxidized weed taste chocolatey in

1274
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,519
general

1275
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:44,960
why do you think it was chocolate thai

1276
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,318
yeah exactly

1277
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,318
it wasn't because it was fresh

1278
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,039
uh what else casper og talk

1279
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,519
it's just ken's og that came from uh

1280
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,039
from josh there you go

1281
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:00,880
i mean that that cross with the face

1282
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,719
offline

1283
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,039
yeah it won't extract without ionized

1284
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,199
water

1285
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,599
i know i know blonde had a good question

1286
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,358
here somewhere

1287
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,200
blonde hit it

1288
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:14,559
any opinions on meduse or wood horse

1289
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,480
heroine do you have any interactions

1290
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,199
with chris

1291
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,559
no yeah i don't i personally i'm all my

1292
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,559
interactions with him he's been a dick

1293
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,400
but i think he just he openly says he

1294
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,599
doesn't really like americans so that

1295
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,039
that's my

1296
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,200
only interaction i wouldn't be chasing

1297
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,079
down marijuana personally

1298
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,239
um

1299
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,160
biggest i mean i saw the best the best

1300
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,559
heroin i ever saw

1301
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,480
was um

1302
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,559
from uh

1303
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,440
uh the heroin og that used to go around

1304
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,000
la yeah right and i i don't know if he's

1305
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,240
claiming that he bred heroin but heroin

1306
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,838
is a steve tuck thing yeah you know

1307
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,000
so

1308
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:55,599
yeah which most people forget about that

1309
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,119
guy even though he had a big impact on

1310
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,960
a lot of people forget where all this

1311
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,400
[ __ ] came from there wasn't that many

1312
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,920
people

1313
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,760
yeah i'm surprised when people when

1314
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,519
people talk about heroin you never hear

1315
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,839
tough's name brought up but

1316
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,480
no even though he's

1317
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,639
super [ __ ] known for it and

1318
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,719
15 years ago he was like the only source

1319
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,400
for it yeah

1320
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:18,639
i think he made it i think they made it

1321
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,119
and called it that yeah that's that's

1322
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:23,519
that's the that's what he says yeah

1323
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,440
yeah like i don't remember ever hearing

1324
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:26,719
it other than with his name attached to

1325
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,800
it

1326
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,358
is he still around yeah he does videos

1327
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,519
if you go on uh youtube he does strain

1328
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,759
history videos that are

1329
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:38,000
probably some of the most grown groan

1330
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,760
worthy [ __ ] strain history videos

1331
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,760
i've ever seen

1332
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,280
