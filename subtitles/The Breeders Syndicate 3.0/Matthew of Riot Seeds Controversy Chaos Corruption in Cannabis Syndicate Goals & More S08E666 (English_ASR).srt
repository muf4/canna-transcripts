welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,039
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,839
cannabis strain history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,000
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,440
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,359
subculture

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,080
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11

to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,379
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,379
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,280
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,280
to the underground

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,119

I'm a breed of Syndicate member and

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,039
collaborator and today I have the unique

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,419
privilege of welcoming Matt Riot onto

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,100
his own show

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,600
it's an episode that many of The

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,820
Syndicate members have been requesting

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,679
and it's going to be all about Matt

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,179
I've come up with some questions and

29
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,799
I've also collected questions from other

30
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,379
Syndicate members

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,659
uh Welcome Matt to the show

32
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,699
thank you how you doing today Matt all

33
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,100
right thank you for uh doing this it's a

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,460
it's an awkward one like we've talked

35
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:19,259
about you know to have an interview of

36
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,438
me on our own show and I've kind of put

37
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,118
it off for a long time like yours uh

38
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,639
just because I don't I don't like taming

39
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,280
the pool with me much but because people

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,319
were asking so much I you know

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,900
what are you gonna do

42
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,658
I think it's a really important show and

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,478
it's an absolute honor for me and I also

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,280
was thinking this like it's such a matte

45
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,438
punk rock move to be like let's just get

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,978
this guy who no one knows who has no

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,500
cloud in the scene to interview me

48
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,000
I mean you're good I I you know we did

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,078
the we did one for people who don't know

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,180
we did one

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,279
um not really an interview but it kind

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,939
of you know you filled with questions in

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,579
a um a chat form on our our patreon

54
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,199
Discord and it was really really good

55
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,978
like I felt really comfortable so I

56
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,420
thought this is perfect perfect timing

57
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,098
um yeah

58
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,839
yeah I almost forgot about that okay

59
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,579
yeah yeah that's true

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,560
well we're going to jump right into it

61
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,120
and we're going to begin just with your

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,280
breeding work

63
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,920
um so the first questions I guess are

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,780
how did you get into breeding at all to

65
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,179
begin with

66
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,759
so I you know like

67
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,560
my interest in strength well first off

68
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:37,979
my dad was a grower and a dealer so like

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,319
I've been around the black market as it

70
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,939
were my whole life whole life entire

71
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,979
life he was in and out of prison so I

72
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,840
didn't live with him but you know it

73
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,340
means my dad

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,939
and uh

75
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,340
you know I got into plants by him at a

76
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,159
young age but there was no like passion

77
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,420
for it at all like I got into other kind

78
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,139
of drugs as a kid and much later on

79
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,079
um

80
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,479
one of my buddies had moved to Alaska he

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
got in trouble in high school and had to

82
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,899
move to Alaska my buddy Josh shout out

83
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,779
to Josh

84
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,539
um and he came back like After High

85
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,039
School a few years later and we were all

86
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,259
hanging out at my house and he was the

87
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,019
only one that was really like a heavy

88
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,459
Stoner and not a heavy Other Drug user

89
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,860
you know he was just a stoner for the

90
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,780
most part of the time and he bring over

91
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,340
this dank and I'm like ah what is this

92
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,800
and I was smoking stuff that was just

93
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,800
trashing my brain like just getting

94
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,019
these songs and he had the story that he

95
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,420
brought about this string called Matt

96
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,099
nuska Valley [ __ ] and when he

97
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,658
told it to me he told it to me as Matt

98
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:44,459
and he's got Valley Thunder [ __ ] which

99
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:45,719
is kind of cool because later on I

100
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,280
realized he actually had his [ __ ]

101
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,719
together and knew exactly what it was

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,939
called and where it was from and all

103
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,098
that and he was just a kid at the time

104
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,139
so that's when I started getting an

105
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,699
interest in actual strains and he

106
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,878
brought over High Times and showed me

107
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:02,039
what White Rhino was White Widow you

108
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,139
know some of that started the bud of

109
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,298
what people would call White Rhino or

110
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,859
white widow would show up in our groups

111
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,200
you know and like we get to smoke that

112
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,340
and I'm not sure if it really was you

113
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,958
know but

114
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,459
um that's kind of how my interesting

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,319
started when was this 2000

116
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,298
2000 it would have been right after high

117
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,519
school so 2000 2001 somewhere in there

118
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,859
when we started getting those strains

119
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,680
and right after that I mean it took a

120
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,979
few a few years after medical started in

121
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,620
California it took a few years before in

122
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:36,180
our city there would be places that

123
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,120
would kind of pop up as collectives

124
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,120
right so it took I was trying to

125
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,519
remember it would be about 2004 2003

126
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,759
before they started really popping up in

127
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,740
Oildale in like the what's known as like

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,360
the ghetto ghetto of Bakersfield this

129
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,840
place called Oildale

130
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,840
um predominantly Caucasian and a lot of

131
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,039
meth use in that part yeah and that's

132
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,239
where the collectives were though you

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,379
had to roll through there to go there

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,000
because that's where the cops weren't

135
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,500
going right and it had to be outside of

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,120
City Limits and that place is outside of

137
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,978
technical city limits

138
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,899
and I remember going in there and they

139
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:11,399
had this is the first time I saw the

140
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,978
list of medical strains that were in

141
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,418
California they had Scentsy star it's

142
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:17,219
Urban Poison

143
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,599
blueberry

144
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,199
um what else is on there white rhino

145
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,240
White Widow and maybe one more

146
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,460
um I can't remember what else skunk won

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
or you know it wasn't OG Kush at the

148
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,879
time yet

149
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,038
um but yeah that's what was considered

150
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,478
medical strains in California so for a

151
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,680
long time I just assumed if it wasn't on

152
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:36,240
that list it probably wasn't medical

153
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,620
right because that's like our

154
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,538
understanding of medical and California

155
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,399
medical at the time was very very

156
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:43,759
minimal

157
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:47,399
um it wasn't until I moved to San Diego

158
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:51,300
where I had more money because I was

159
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:53,159
working at Sony doing uh their their

160
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,060
vital help and support web development

161
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,400
stuff

162
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,918
and I had extra money and I could

163
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,719
I could grow like I got lights and I

164
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,758
started growing doing [ __ ] on my own

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,620
buying seeds and experimenting a little

166
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,400
bit you know

167
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,680
um

168
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,319
that's that's mainly when I started

169
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,660
getting into strains but I really didn't

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,579
know what I was doing it was like anyone

171
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,320
that just jumps into the c community at

172
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,359
first right like you're trying to feel

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,579
your way through

174
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,860
um so I was going to High Times you know

175
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,899
the typical skunk magazine and looking

176
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,600
at who was in there what strains are

177
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,159
cool and of course High Times you what I

178
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,620
didn't know at the time was like you

179
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,080
open high times and it's one long ad

180
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,819
one long almost paid ad in many cases

181
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,859
yeah but a lot of them look like

182
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,020
interviews and articles but a lot of

183
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,479
them are paid ads in ways where like

184
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,519
people do parties for High Times and

185
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,099
High Times will reward them with an

186
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,599
article right or an interview but in a

187
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,939
way it is an exchange and if you don't

188
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,919
do those exchanges you're not in it I

189
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,839
didn't understand all that so I thought

190
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,698
that these people were the best at it

191
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,799
you know like they were the ones every

192
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,720
time in High Times and that's when I

193
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,319
started like buying seeds from BC Bud

194
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,220
Depot places like that

195
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,460
and uh

196
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,199
in doing that I had collected you know a

197
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,659
large portion of strains they spent a

198
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,038
lot of money at first on like DJ Short

199
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,699
Stuff

200
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:21,000
um what else Dutch Passion DNA a lot of

201
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,620
DNA about us about so much DNA stuff

202
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,720
um

203
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,360
so at this point were you buying these

204
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,360
seeds to just to grow with or had you

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,520
already been thinking about breeding no

206
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,098
at this point I was just buying to grow

207
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,418
and and I was already I mean I wasn't

208
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:38,219
thinking about braiding in the sense of

209
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:39,779
breeding right at that point I was

210
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,699
thinking of making more seeds for myself

211
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,619
because this is getting very expensive

212
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,180
you know yeah totally but I was more

213
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,560
into keeping clones because in

214
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,199
California that's what I understood was

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,959
clones so I was more into popping seeds

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,400
to get clones to trade clones at that

217
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,899
point

218
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,638
um because like that's that was kind of

219
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,799
the hip thing to do in California SoCal

220
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,500
was like have clones you got this rare

221
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,000
clone oh no you know but I but most of

222
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,279
them weren't buying seeds most of those

223
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,199
guys knew nothing about buying seeds

224
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,758
from Amsterdam or England none of them

225
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,560
did all the guys that had clones none of

226
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,180
them would do that so I was the one guy

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160
in our group that was buying seeds from

228
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,740
outside the United States and bringing

229
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,580
those like selecting a cut and and

230
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,259
passing those around so it was weird for

231
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:25,198
someone to pop up with all these strains

232
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,220
and I was such a noob I went on

233
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,379
Craigslist

234
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,780
and posted that I was wanting to trade

235
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,120
here's my clones wanna trade like that's

236
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,439
pretty newbie right like but at the time

237
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
like

238
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,200
it was such a wild west of the medical

239
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,659
cannabis community that it wasn't as

240
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,580
crazy as doing it like

241
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,080
where people are killing people on

242
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,759
Craigslist type [ __ ] you know like it's

243
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,200
still pretty early on

244
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,000
um yeah and that's where I met this dude

245
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,339
Doug

246
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,120
and he was the main inspiration for

247
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,399
breeding uh understanding breeding but

248
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,700
he was like my introduction into who is

249
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,100
a man named James Gonzalez who also is

250
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,100
known as James hodd how did those two

251
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,778
Crews kind of uh you know work out for

252
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:15,300
you so yeah so when I met James uh that

253
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:19,620
was through Doug and Doug and James were

254
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:22,319
doing a partnership in a grow and I

255
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,399
brought over a bunch of my shitty I will

256
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,519
say shitty selections of BC Bud Depot

257
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,559
and like all these like Spanish strains

258
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,959
that I thought were Dutch right like the

259
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,639
Cincy stuff all the DJ Short Stuff which

260
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,338
a lot of it didn't pop but what did was

261
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,500
there and he was willing to trade me for

262
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,180
some of the rarest clones in California

263
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,799
at the time and I didn't know that like

264
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:45,479
I had no clue how rare these things were

265
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,699
at the time it's only in retrospect that

266
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,278
I understood what he gave me like he had

267
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,140
like fire oh G he had a very good cut of

268
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,639
Apollo 13 which at the time was super

269
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,240
rare

270
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,220
um

271
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,839
what else was there

272
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,480
I mean he had the Hog's Breath because

273
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,820
where I first saw that anyways that he

274
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,580
had he had a whole library of

275
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,560
amazingness oh chemd he had Kim D like

276
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,160
long before anybody else he had Kim D

277
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,838
wow okay and um like that's super early

278
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,819
on for Kim d That's he would have been

279
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,620
writing the the crew that got it via

280
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,180
like sub-rop or those guys from crazy

281
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,860
composer he would have been right in

282
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,699
that line

283
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,278
um

284
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,600
and so like he was working on a grow

285
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,120
with James and that's how I met James

286
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,320
and James owned unified collective in

287
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,839
San Diego

288
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
and after meeting James I would go in

289
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,260
there all the time like just you know

290
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,600
like go in there kick it talk breeding

291
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,539
talk about my interests and passions uh

292
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,420
buy clones from him he had an amazing um

293
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,699
he hadn't made he had a big jar of seeds

294
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,439
of bubbleberry just a massive jar

295
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,600
sitting up on the front counter and you

296
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,160
could reach in grab it for you know

297
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,120
it wasn't even that much money he was

298
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,679
charging I think it was like a dollar

299
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,379
seed or whatever at the time you can

300
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,819
grab it and give him 20. you didn't care

301
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,620
um and it was amazing amazing

302
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,440
bubbleberry we used that in some lines

303
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,259
too and he had clones um what did he

304
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,480
have he had the peht which is the potent

305
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,278
evolved hybrid type from Neville or

306
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,720
early on

307
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,480
um it became known as Ed Rosenthal

308
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,360
superbud later and he had a really early

309
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,278
cut of that which just phenomenal

310
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,200
um he had Northern Lights of course it

311
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,059
didn't say five one two none of that

312
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,920
just said Northern Lights

313
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,919
um

314
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,539
Williams Wonder he had that the MLB

315
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,338
Williams Wonder Major League Major

316
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,500
League bud

317
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,180
um there was a lot more in that crew but

318
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,320
I would go in so and we would stop

319
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:36,599
reading

320
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,959
how old were you

321
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,579
I was probably 25 26 27 somewhere in

322
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,979
there I was older and my I was I wasn't

323
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:47,338
a young man at that time by my

324
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,740
by my idea of life experience I in my

325
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,240
mind I got into this very late

326
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,459
um right because a lot of people around

327
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,778
me were older but there were a lot of

328
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,759
people around me that were younger too

329
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,919
and

330
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,958
um with the urban Growers society that

331
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,819
was kind of inspired by James because

332
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,500
what we were seeing and this is

333
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,379
something that annoyed him and he kind

334
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,600
of passed off onto me and he worked on

335
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:12,480
his Collective with this on his own and

336
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,519
he helped me with mine and it was the

337
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,200
idea was all these collectives are

338
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,120
majorly benefiting

339
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,640
from medical patients like real ones

340
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,820
like terminally ill patients

341
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,919
and charging them full price

342
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,120
for it like they're opening these like

343
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,620
the people that are opening these

344
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
collectives are doing this on the basis

345
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,159
of medical the people that were opening

346
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,920
these were not terminally ill for the

347
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,500
most part not not like

348
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,879
any sort of medical anything they were

349
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,339
doing it for recreational which for me

350
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,078
is fine but if you're doing it off the

351
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,240
backs of medical patients and these

352
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,799
terminally ill patients if we really

353
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,120
believe what we're doing and we really

354
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,458
believe in the passion for this plant

355
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,500
and its medical abilities there is no

356
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,259
reason we should be charging them that

357
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,278
in my mind there's no like not 10 bucks

358
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,899
not 20 bucks not 30 bucks if you care

359
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,059
and you can afford it you should be

360
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,759
putting your own livelihood into this

361
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,859
and at the time because the whole the

362
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,299
way it was it just felt like it needed a

363
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,180
big pushback so that's what that was

364
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,919
about and James and me put together you

365
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,439
know I think it got up to like 43 people

366
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,659
in the community that were all growing

367
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,820
that were all giving away their weed if

368
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,278
they're meta for totally ill patients

369
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,500
you know that that decision that moment

370
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,200
I mean did one of the questions I had

371
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,419
for you was you know

372
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,639
what other influences kind of had an

373
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,039
impact on some of these decisions and

374
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,839
yeah what what do you think drove you to

375
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,958
this kind of like more communal spirit

376
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,760
because that's to me that seems rare in

377
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,619
that so part of part of that was my best

378
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,319
friend's mom who raised me died of

379
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,659
pancreatic cancer and that was when I

380
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,620
was

381
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:53,219
20.

382
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,740
no 21 I was 21 yeah and she raised me

383
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,899
like that was like my mom as much as my

384
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,019
grandma or my mom that must have been

385
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,759
devastating it was horrible and um and

386
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,879
he had died a year before that my best

387
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,278
friend so it was is like double and oh

388
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,419
my God we and no one was taking care of

389
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,338
her so

390
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:12,838
and she wasn't a pot smoker but she had

391
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,220
when she was young so she was willing to

392
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,560
try cannabis

393
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,800
um during those brief months it was six

394
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,719
months until she passed and I was trying

395
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,379
to find any strain that would help her

396
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,120
any anything you know like it was all

397
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:30,419
black market [ __ ] at the time so it was

398
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,039
like I was trying to find anything and I

399
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,319
saw that like it would help her get out

400
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,299
of bed come to the table she was able to

401
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,980
eat dinner and hold it down for a little

402
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:40,078
bit you know like it just gave her just

403
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,879
that much comfort so that was part of it

404
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,979
like that was part of that passion like

405
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,179
that burning feeling in my stomach that

406
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,100
something had to be done for these

407
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,679
people because I saw it firsthand and it

408
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,980
was someone I loved deeply you know um

409
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:56,399
the other thing was in communal spirit

410
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,778
I moved out when I was like 11 of my

411
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,000
parents house my actual parents house

412
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:02,278
and moved in with my grandma my grandma

413
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,559
was awesome she raised me great but like

414
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,820
other people raised me too I was kind of

415
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,559
a street kid at that point I just did

416
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,778
whatever I want like I guess you caught

417
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,619
latchkey kid or whatever

418
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:13,559
um

419
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:17,039
and in doing so like I would go to punk

420
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:19,859
rock shows and play shows and in that

421
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,838
Community where we were at it was a very

422
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,399
small community here and that's where I

423
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,980
got that Community spirit I had older

424
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,179
dudes taking care of me like whether we

425
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,320
were fighting and making sure I didn't

426
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,778
get hurt

427
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,339
um uh whether I was drinking too much

428
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,379
and they're telling me [ __ ] you grow up

429
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,480
you know like you can't do that you know

430
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:37,980
or whatever it was it was a communal

431
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,778
Spirit we all kind of raised each other

432
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,159
in a weird way and and what their life

433
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:47,338
what happened in their lives deeply

434
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,439
affected my lives and I brought that

435
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,899
everywhere with me I try to go because I

436
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,399
see the powering in in numbers in the

437
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,259
power and people and the power in love

438
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,480
as stupid as that sounds for me to say

439
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,819
it really is true like the power I mean

440
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,699
I completely love and I can't see it in

441
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,778
The Syndicate yeah for sure like we care

442
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:06,539
about each other and it's very

443
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:08,639
passionate and like but we also trust

444
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,679
each other very deeply and inherently

445
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,259
and we have reasons to you know like

446
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,638
we've the actions built that but yeah

447
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:16,860
that's what that that's what that idea

448
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,659
came from

449
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,879
that's cool that's that's such an

450
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:21,480
amazing set of stories

451
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,578
um

452
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,379
so I guess the next

453
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:27,838
to me the next logical thing to go on to

454
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:30,419
is what would you consider your first

455
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,579
real breeding project

456
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,799
my first real braiding project where I

457
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:37,379
was breeding breeding

458
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,299
I was doing a few things at once at two

459
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:40,980
different locations

460
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:43,258
um I had

461
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,639
see if the Clockwork cut when I was

462
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,959
first given it it wasn't called

463
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,278
Clockwork Orange it didn't really have a

464
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,899
name

465
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,939
um yeah I got a few different stories

466
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,320
from Doug but the one I believe because

467
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,699
I don't even like telling the other one

468
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,019
because it's just so asinine what I

469
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:57,359
believe was that he went to a coffee

470
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,759
shop in Amsterdam and he ordered some

471
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,879
Alaskan ice Bud and in that bud there

472
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,959
was like two seeds and he brought that

473
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,380
home

474
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:10,500
grew them and one of the plants looked

475
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,000
like a monster it looked like like we

476
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,798
weren't used to a lot of mutations at

477
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,779
the time and seen crazy Leaf mutations

478
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,099
and whatnot and this thing it had what

479
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,259
we called the crinkle Leaf a lot of

480
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,399
people associate that like OG KB or the

481
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:22,140
legend cut

482
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,280
those weren't big cuts at the time so we

483
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,500
wouldn't associate it with any of that

484
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,178
so we called it the crinkle cut

485
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,220
well

486
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,380
when I saw that plant it was it was

487
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,220
super potent

488
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,020
um

489
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,259
it was

490
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,538
it was just super Frosty super dank but

491
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,740
those leaves bothered me and I looked at

492
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,240
it I thought No One's Gonna grow this

493
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,259
this isn't a clone anyone's going to

494
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,140
want to pass they're going to think it's

495
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:48,538
diseased whatever so in my mind I needed

496
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,400
to put that into seed and shake out that

497
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:51,900
tray because I Knew by this time that it

498
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,038
could be done that you could shake out

499
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,120
trades

500
00:17:53,038 --> 00:18:00,359
and I tried for a good year and a half I

501
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:03,239
did some VX ones and stuff and I

502
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:05,219
couldn't do it accurately I could not

503
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,200
find a potent version without that

504
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,880
crinkle Leaf formation so at the time in

505
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,360
my head I thought it was a link trait As

506
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,520
I understood it and stopped I stopped

507
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,619
with the best selection that I had from

508
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,779
those seeds of my own and that's what

509
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,139
became the Clockwork Orange cut and it

510
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:24,178
was just a crinkly Fino from those seeds

511
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,780
um yeah

512
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:29,880
what else did you do with that cut

513
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,099
um let's see what else do we do with

514
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,140
Clockwork we used it over the years

515
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:36,119
um it became our Flagship strain a lot

516
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,799
of people assumed it was orangey

517
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,859
because

518
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,839
of the name obviously but like

519
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,399
um wait I don't have it up here anymore

520
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,199
but like I'm a big Clockwork Orange fan

521
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,940
and like it's one of my favorite movies

522
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,580
and in our city there's not a lot of

523
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,500
citrus in that movie no no

524
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,699
but there's a lot of Ultraviolence in

525
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,220
that movie and that's the way that cut

526
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,220
made me feel better violent dude like

527
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,600
you up yeah like you got a bat to your

528
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,700
legs

529
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,798
um yeah it was just super potent so

530
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,419
that's that's why I named it that but a

531
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,759
lot of people expected that and it took

532
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,200
a long time to explain that

533
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,940
um but we used it over the years on

534
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,400
almost everything we did s ones we did

535
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,160
several iterations of s1s that would

536
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,700
always sell out every time we had it

537
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,100
um the bx1 we sold those which was the

538
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,840
uh Clockworks the Neville skunk to the

539
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:26,399
Clockwork

540
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,439
um and the Neville skunk was in Devil's

541
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,400
hay skunk one

542
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,400
um what else do we do

543
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,320
I don't know I mean we even we did A

544
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,839
Clockwork Cola that was kind of cool

545
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,339
that was the AK-47 RC Cola cut which

546
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,819
never gets brought up it was an old cut

547
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:44,159
passed around on skunk magazine

548
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:46,798
um we did Clockwork cookies which was

549
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,360
absolutely amazing for its time but like

550
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,519
looking back like who gives a [ __ ] about

551
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,779
a copper of cookies right like of all

552
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,339
the other things I've done with it like

553
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:55,740
he cares about that and we did the

554
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:57,119
Clockwork piff which was a big one and

555
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,720
someone is still taking through

556
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:05,339
generations right now which was the um

557
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:06,779
the uh doggy style d73 piff

558
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,480
um from New York City

559
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:12,298
cross to a reverse Clockwork Orange

560
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,940
uh yeah we we crossed it to everything

561
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:16,440
we could that we had at the time slammed

562
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,779
it to everything like most pollen

563
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,419
Checkers would you know

564
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,779
um yeah after after

565
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:26,400
I think it was about 12 years I decided

566
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,379
I don't even think I decided to let it

567
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,360
go I think what happened was that was

568
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,340
with the mobs in the tissue culture

569
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:36,119
thing if I remember correctly

570
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:39,240
oh yes it was it was and um a certain

571
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:43,859
company a certain company

572
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:46,679
um killed it and that's how I lost it

573
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:47,339
there are s1s out there

574
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,320
um

575
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,418
but I just decided to kind of move on

576
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,579
not because of anything about the strain

577
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,640
but I'd worked with it for so long

578
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:58,558
and one of my best friends CSI gave me

579
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,460
good advice to never tie yourself to one

580
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,379
clone

581
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:06,538
because when you do that you don't have

582
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,100
if someone if someone starts working it

583
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:09,839
you'll feel super passionate about it

584
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:11,339
and then what do you move to you're

585
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,740
you're tied to one thing and you're kind

586
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:16,619
of one trick pony at that point so yeah

587
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,120
it's best to you know not just tie

588
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:19,558
yourself to one thing and have that be

589
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,719
your whole try to make it a legacy

590
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:23,220
because legacies aren't created they're

591
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,900
that's something you have nothing to do

592
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,538
with you know what I mean like really

593
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,519
your actions but not how everybody

594
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:31,259
perceives you

595
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,240
you got to be like Voldemort right he's

596
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:37,019
got like these horcruxes it's

597
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,819
distributed yeah in the last the horcrux

598
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,558
is mad like that I use that a lot in

599
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,418
life that that analogy to a lot of

600
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,639
things because like it's a it's a great

601
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,640
analogy you know from it's interesting

602
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,159
from a systems perspective like it

603
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,860
it makes sense to have one big

604
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,960
dependency is extremely fragile it makes

605
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:56,699
for an extremely fragile system so it

606
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,140
totally makes sense yeah I mean

607
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,179
diversify

608
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,038
yeah and the other thing I was going to

609
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,659
say as well is that like you mentioned I

610
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:05,940
think uh you have friends who are still

611
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,320
working with the S1

612
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,320
um yeah

613
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:12,839
is that chronzo with bronzo has the

614
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,759
Clockwork pith Denali has the Clockwork

615
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,019
S1 cut and he has a bunch of the oldest

616
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:17,339
ones

617
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,079
um the S ones are out there in the

618
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,819
community they're getting very old

619
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:22,199
though I don't know how well they pop

620
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,658
for people now

621
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,538
um yeah but yeah no like everybody who's

622
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:29,580
smoked in Ollie's cut is mind blown that

623
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:31,319
it's as strong as chemd and you know has

624
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,178
a kind of no ceiling High that chemd has

625
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,500
but it's totally different

626
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,900
yeah

627
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,759
yeah no very cool yeah thanks for

628
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,620
telling us about that so yeah you

629
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,000
mentioned a couple of other projects of

630
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:45,719
viewers from earlier on I'm not sure

631
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,640
like what order to go into sure but you

632
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,579
know you have banana juice Stuff

633
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,059
strawberry cream Bubba kushwork diesel

634
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:57,058
work yep so let's see where did I start

635
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:59,279
um in that order

636
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:00,058
I want to say banana would probably come

637
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,240
first

638
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:05,399
yeah so my banana Obsession came from a

639
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,140
banana OG cut from Doug that was one of

640
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,298
the cuts that he gave me and I remember

641
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,340
growing it in Fire OG next to each other

642
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,440
and being like oh okay I see I see the

643
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,359
direct relation between these two they

644
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,159
look identical they have totally

645
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,899
different terp profiles because they're

646
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,299
separate parents whatever the Diablo

647
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,640
OG's parent was is more spicy peppery

648
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:25,440
whatever the

649
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,919
um banana OG's parents was was more

650
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,100
skunk 20 right so I was interested in it

651
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,559
and banana was super rare at the time no

652
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:37,439
like the the overgrown days had already

653
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,418
passed right because we were about 2008

654
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,880
2009 by the time I start really working

655
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,640
into bananas so by this by this point

656
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,059
banana had come gone and left

657
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,940
so it was novel it was unique and not a

658
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:53,099
lot of people were using it and

659
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,140
um yeah so I was like this I'm gonna use

660
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,240
this [ __ ] so I got it used it and was

661
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,400
making beautiful beautiful banana cuts

662
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,620
that were super potent banana seed lines

663
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,159
that were super potent uh the most

664
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:07,500
interesting of me was a cut that came by

665
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,600
a guy named his online name was Hugo

666
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,099
himself

667
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,019
and he was a very good friend of mine

668
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,879
over the years like he started off on my

669
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,038
Forum early and we Envy became like

670
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,679
we're still closed to this day me and

671
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,960
him and his wife and um he brought me up

672
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,580
into Platinum banana OG cut and that was

673
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,860
what it was called in his area Platinum

674
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,599
banana OG and this thing was just fire

675
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,339
above fire

676
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,619
um banana OG was originally a seed line

677
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:33,058
called ogier's cush and it was from

678
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:34,619
Oregon kid and that's where people were

679
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:36,779
finding these banana Pinos and over the

680
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,699
years these got called banana OG that

681
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:41,519
would pop up out of these ogiers Kush

682
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,259
packs and so it wasn't it wasn't a seed

683
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,440
line called banana OG early on it was

684
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,000
actually called ogir's Kush but there

685
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,259
were many people popping these seeds and

686
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,380
that's how these different banana lines

687
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:54,900
were amount banana cuts and this one was

688
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,419
just so fire so I was like oh I got an s

689
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,820
on this I have got to S1 this

690
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,520
so I was

691
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:04,740
ver during these years I was not as

692
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,319
versed on pollen control

693
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,538
and I had previously done a Bubba S1 run

694
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,298
right before this

695
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:16,440
and when I made these Platinum banana

696
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:18,359
ogs ones I think the cut that I selected

697
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,159
it was an outlier and I've seen a few

698
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,500
other cuts that were like this over the

699
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,539
years from the same seed line and I have

700
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,179
a feeling that there was Remnant banana

701
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:29,220
OG or I'm sorry uh Bubba S1 reverse

702
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:31,740
pollen in the room and that was what

703
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:35,220
made the Platinum banana OG s ones was

704
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,720
the Bubba and not the banana OG it did

705
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,980
reverse but I think the pollen might

706
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,720
have been unviable and they're still

707
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,720
pollen floating pollen floating in the

708
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,240
room of the um Bubba because I was just

709
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,579
not I was not versed on that at all what

710
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,859
I was doing and it made for some of the

711
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,119
most beautiful

712
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,479
like

713
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,058
Expressions I've still seen today super

714
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,339
black

715
00:25:56,058 --> 00:26:01,440
Frosty as anything and just so Banana

716
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:04,500
artificial Laffy Taffy banana came out

717
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,360
of that line and that line got me a lot

718
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,859
of like a claim because it was really

719
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,778
good but again I don't look at it as

720
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:13,079
like my [ __ ] because it was Oregon kids

721
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:14,579
really and uh random Bubba pollen you

722
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,278
know

723
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:19,379
what was like the um the effects of that

724
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,240
like

725
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,220
um so all that stuff tended to have the

726
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,019
OG Kush High which is

727
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,600
very hard to explain but it is a

728
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:29,940
full-bodied like cerebral High which

729
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,918
what most people consider a super hybrid

730
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,259
at the time like medically it would be

731
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,080
like considered hybrid type high but

732
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:39,179
really it's just a full bodied full

733
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,859
complex High to OG kashas and it's why

734
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,840
it's so special and and this carried

735
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,158
that on very well Bubba Kush

736
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,139
um when grown well could do the same

737
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,539
thing it has a very similar type High

738
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,360
and um combining the two just really

739
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:53,940
really nailed it for its time I will say

740
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,859
for its time it was special to me and I

741
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,000
think it was special to a few people and

742
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:00,859
that's one of the ones that I actually

743
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,538
am proud of is that work but again like

744
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:04,918
after years and years of doing this you

745
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,919
you learn

746
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,259
to kind of drop any kind of ego from it

747
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,000
and pride in what you have done

748
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:13,679
but more pride in what those have done

749
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,460
before you and that you were able to put

750
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,740
out

751
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,419
if that makes sense yeah I can I can

752
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,460
understand that at some point it kind of

753
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:22,320
becomes its own thing in the world and

754
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,538
has its own life outside of your voice

755
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,339
right yeah right like and I'm proud that

756
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:29,339
thing exists but it's not much more than

757
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:31,558
anything that like I kind of went you

758
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:32,819
know and that's how allbreeding is in my

759
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,099
mind

760
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,139
I mean okay in terms of like the

761
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:40,619
timeline

762
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:43,080
the this this work comes also before the

763
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,058
the great tissue culture debacle yeah oh

764
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:48,058
yeah yeah that was fairly recent in my

765
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:49,798
mind like five years ago or less maybe

766
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:52,019
four or three or four I didn't realize

767
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:54,058
yeah that was real reason yeah

768
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:55,679
yeah okay okay so

769
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:59,158
um right before that I had the bubble

770
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,600
work and the bubble work was it was just

771
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,240
like I got a hold of the Bubba Kush

772
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:05,519
clone um I want to say that was from ape

773
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,220
PNC people's nursery care shout out to

774
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,859
ape he's he's a lot of my stuff like the

775
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,038
strawberry cream cut came from him

776
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:17,759
um he had a great great he had the best

777
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:20,819
I will say the best clone Nursery

778
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,038
up until that point I had ever seen with

779
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,798
the best provenance and I will say to

780
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,419
date it is the best Nursery that ever

781
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:29,639
existed with the best provenance because

782
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,400
that dude did his research the cuts that

783
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,278
he got like 90 of the time were accurate

784
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,740
which is way hard and during that era

785
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,900
way harder you know

786
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,720
um he was legit dude's still around and

787
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,538
he's still legit so yeah I

788
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,620
he's not often talked about by breeders

789
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:49,019
from California

790
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:50,939
um he worked a swerve early on and was

791
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,960
an early owner of Cali Connection if I

792
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,380
remember correctly one of his first

793
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,120
partners and was responsible for you

794
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,620
know a lot of swerves cuts but he

795
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,178
doesn't get named much so I figured I'd

796
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,819
bring him up now because like he's even

797
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,679
who lumpy sent me down the cookies crew

798
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:06,658
stuff really early on before anyone else

799
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,519
had it and that Apes the one who brought

800
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,200
it down from lumpy you know so I want to

801
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,579
give him a lot of props here he's a cool

802
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,038
dude

803
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:16,619
that's cool yeah thanks for sharing that

804
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:18,379
so the Bubba the bubble work yeah it was

805
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:22,739
it was

806
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,240
not new for cannabis because a lot of

807
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,519
people like Oregon kid and all them had

808
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,679
done bubble work before me CSI all of

809
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,538
them had done public work before me but

810
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,940
it was years later and as we know in

811
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:35,759
cannabis things are cyclical and by that

812
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,659
time no one was making Bubba S1 CSI had

813
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,339
kind of dropped from the scene

814
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,200
completely to do his I think he was

815
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:42,240
doing his own thing cropping and stuff

816
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,419
and not really working online not

817
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,519
dealing with online business so

818
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:50,720
um that was a time in the market where I

819
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,639
could come in and make s1s do Femme work

820
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,259
and it was a time when people really

821
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,240
really did not like what I was doing

822
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:59,819
they're feminizing and still today

823
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,919
people don't like it for the most part

824
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:04,740
okay we're gonna I have a question

825
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,299
specifically on on firms and reversals

826
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,759
later on but I did want to ask a

827
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:10,980
tangential question here which is okay

828
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:14,759
as an outsider I find it interesting

829
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:19,558
because why Bubba Kush doesn't get named

830
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:21,480
uh as much as OG and the 911 you know is

831
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,339
that because it's kind of like under the

832
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,620
umbrella of OG or kind of in the shadow

833
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,079
of OG Bubba doesn't seem to get its own

834
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,939
mention a lot even though there's a lot

835
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,759
of work done with it you know I don't

836
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,558
know why there's like the OG Obsession

837
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,019
about the Bubba

838
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:38,940
um Bubba Kush is half OG Kush as as it's

839
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,558
been told as I I would agree you can

840
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,880
smell OG cushion it if you grow it

841
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,220
certain ways

842
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,140
um I think it's always lived in the

843
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,298
shadow of OG

844
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,100
um it's a lot I don't want to say it's

845
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:52,619
harder to grow because it's really easy

846
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:55,918
to grow Bubba it's very hard to cure and

847
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:58,439
dry Bubba to get it to be right and a

848
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,179
lot of people lose Bubba in the Cure

849
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,640
um a lot of people say Bubba's Booth

850
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:05,460
because of it you know and it doesn't

851
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,520
have the super rounded high that OG Kush

852
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,460
has or the THC percentage OG has most

853
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:14,460
importantly okay but it is potent and it

854
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,679
does have a similar quality of high I

855
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,778
should say maybe not as Skyrocket potent

856
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,600
as some of OG's will get you but it does

857
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:23,519
have a similar quality high and yeah

858
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,079
though I think probably the THC

859
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,639
percentage because that's so important

860
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:28,079
to people in California and collectives

861
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,880
is probably what keeps Bubba from

862
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:34,220
kicking up to the top because it's

863
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,220
usually like 18 to 20 you know

864
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,860
it vidges really slowly as well yes yeah

865
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,179
it's a it's more squat than OG but it's

866
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,678
still kind of depending on how you grow

867
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:46,380
it you can make that thing grow lanky

868
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,059
but it is slower to grow than OG

869
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,460
um it's not as slow as things like Urkel

870
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:52,798
but it has a reputation for being slow

871
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,558
so okay

872
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,278
okay no that's super cool

873
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:58,500
um

874
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:00,538
if you're happy with the you know that

875
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,980
account of your Bubba work uh shall we

876
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:04,679
move on to the strawberry cream yeah

877
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,220
yeah so strawberry cream I got from

878
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,659
again apnc and I didn't know much about

879
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,819
it for years

880
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:14,278
um other than first I didn't even know

881
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,778
if it was the same one from CBF didn't

882
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,298
know

883
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:20,460
um I by the time I got it it was right

884
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:23,398
when ape was closing up and he had

885
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,079
closed shop we lost contact at the very

886
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:26,939
like I gotten it

887
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,259
a month later he was gone and we lost

888
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,419
contact so

889
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:32,038
I didn't know much about it I spent a

890
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,419
lot of years trying to figure it out and

891
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:34,859
I was convinced it was an herb beer

892
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,659
because it grew exactly like that plant

893
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:38,398
Earth beer and I started growing these

894
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,679
and it smelled like it

895
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,199
but what I found out was that it came

896
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,278
from Strawberry Cough which Strawberry

897
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,360
Cough is supposed to be strawberry

898
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:47,278
because of a string called Strawberry

899
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,259
Fields And we haven't identified that so

900
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:52,679
I have some suspicions from breeding

901
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:57,000
stuff in my head what it might be

902
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:59,580
um but the story goes that uh CBF got

903
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,200
some s1s of Strawberry Cough from

904
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:05,158
goldeneyes

905
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,778
and goldeneyes was a female on overgrow

906
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,020
um she worked with black Russians some

907
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:11,880
shishka Berry stuff and uh and the

908
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:14,879
strawberry cough and when he popped him

909
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,620
he got some males and females which

910
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,480
probably means pollen contamination

911
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,099
which makes sense she was doing a lot at

912
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,399
that time in a small space

913
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:25,439
and um he crossed those two together and

914
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:29,518
that's what started strawberry cream

915
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,038
and this line was so resonance

916
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,480
so mold resistant

917
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:39,658
so strawberry and it bred so strawberry

918
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,778
and everything it touched was just bag

919
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:47,700
appeal to the to the nines turpwise

920
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:49,679
amazing The Hive was a lot a lot less

921
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,240
than you would say like an OG kosher

922
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,460
Bubba Kush it wasn't the same kind of

923
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,919
high it was so much more mild I would

924
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,220
put it in the silver Pearl era category

925
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,759
of Highs real quality so it always took

926
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,860
away my anxiety which I like you know it

927
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:06,599
took the edge off but it wouldn't like

928
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:08,639
lay me out to where I felt like I was

929
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,219
always saying something stupid you know

930
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,039
I didn't get stupid mouth and I like

931
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,059
that I hate having stupid mouth and you

932
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,320
know what I'm talking about where like

933
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:17,579
you perceive yourself as saying

934
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,659
something stupid like if everything

935
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,639
comes out of your mouth and you're like

936
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,679
did I see something stupid like I think

937
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,119
I kind of weird and this is not that

938
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,519
kind of weed

939
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,679
um but yeah bag of Peel to the nines and

940
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:29,820
cedarberry Farms stepped off the forums

941
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,858
for a while

942
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,480
so it was really hard to hunt down and

943
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:37,559
during that time I did a lot of work

944
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,519
with it um I bx1ed it and I crossed it

945
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,299
to

946
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:43,800
um Johnny Blaze from Legend seeds uh red

947
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,320
from Legend seeds I believe made Johnny

948
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,280
Blaze and that was in Neville's Haze DJ

949
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,280
Short Blueberry mail

950
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:53,460
um the reason I did that was because in

951
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,440
the room I had Santa Cruz Blue Dream

952
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,300
right next to it and I noticed that

953
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,099
these two cuts and I used to have

954
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,200
side-by-side pictures of all this stuff

955
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:03,660
but and I probably do somewhere on a

956
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,699
hard drive but side by side they looked

957
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:07,618
almost identical it was very hard to

958
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:10,139
tell the difference of them in flower

959
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,880
and because of that I was like oh Blue

960
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:14,159
Dream will be the perfect outcross if if

961
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,039
I want to make a regular seed line and

962
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,199
again I go back to bx1 making regular

963
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:23,219
seed lines of this stuff because I had

964
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:25,980
caught so much Flack for feminized seeds

965
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:28,379
over the years by this point we're

966
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,619
talking 2000

967
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,660
9 2010 2011.

968
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,740
of my strawberry work because it's about

969
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:36,000
I always put it about a three year

970
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:38,819
period because that's how long it takes

971
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,838
to do serious work on lines for me to go

972
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,460
from

973
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,980
popping them

974
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,980
to testing and running them

975
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,659
to possible bx1 if I'm happy or to

976
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,280
finding out that I screwed up you know

977
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:51,719
so about three years to figure out

978
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,579
whether I'm doing good with the line or

979
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,338
not to the point where I can sell it and

980
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:57,900
and get it out there in mass and the

981
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:59,820
testers have gotten back to me if I use

982
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,780
testers

983
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,000
um

984
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,780
uh where was I at those three years I

985
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,780
was doing strawberry

986
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,599
brain fart

987
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,559
strawberry cream and you forget what

988
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,940
you're doing

989
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:16,679
yeah

990
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,900
um I don't know

991
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,539
uh the strawberry oh yeah CBF was was

992
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,760
gone during those years in 2009 2011.

993
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:25,380
and um so it's not like I could reach

994
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,820
out to him and talk to him so I was

995
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,858
releasing this work

996
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,838
um the Johnny Blaze was the outcross in

997
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:32,460
it because the Blue Dream stuff

998
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,440
and

999
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,838
it was just it was phenomenal everybody

1000
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,700
that got it liked it and I also had

1001
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:40,739
during these years I had an East Coast

1002
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:43,078
Sour Diesel strawberry cream from CBF in

1003
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:45,539
seed that I had traded for by this point

1004
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,039
and I had already

1005
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,259
um during the first two years I had

1006
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,000
crossed East Coast Sour Diesel

1007
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,740
um the

1008
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,719
the choco cut I called it but it was

1009
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:58,199
just east coast Sour Diesel

1010
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,159
um across that to a strawberry cream bx1

1011
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,578
mail

1012
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:03,539
and I did not like the results but I

1013
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,579
popped

1014
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:07,679
CBS East Coast Sour Diesel strawberry

1015
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:10,560
cream and immediately everything was

1016
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:13,139
fire every last seed from that line was

1017
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,659
a keeper and so I used a mail from that

1018
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:18,420
line in further work which also made

1019
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:19,980
more strawberry work and some of the

1020
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,420
most famous work that came from the East

1021
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,858
Coast Sour Diesel strawberry cream or

1022
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,300
the stuff that came most popular was the

1023
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:27,059
strawberry switchblade

1024
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,300
and again that's uh yes in that

1025
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:32,159
strawberry vein it is my

1026
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,400
when people ask about my strawberry work

1027
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,799
and what I think I liked best I would

1028
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,260
say the strawberry switchblade only

1029
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:45,539
because it had the potency of the sour

1030
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:49,200
it had the looks and smell of strawberry

1031
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:51,719
cream and it had the color of one of the

1032
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,779
parents which was a double purple Doja

1033
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:57,059
I'm sorry it was double red dojo

1034
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,839
which was a hybrid a double purple Doja

1035
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:02,400
and it was just blood red beautiful

1036
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,799
magenta with blood red leaves it was it

1037
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,660
was gorgeous and that trait passed on

1038
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,099
pretty regularly in the the strawberry

1039
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,440
switchblade so it was like the best of

1040
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,338
all three parents constantly lining up

1041
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,019
well

1042
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:18,179
but like realistically cvf's line was so

1043
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:20,099
good and so true breeding for whatever

1044
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:21,838
reason I don't know if he had taken it

1045
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,940
generations and that's what I got or it

1046
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,279
just light the allows lined up perfectly

1047
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,838
but for whatever reason his line was so

1048
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,339
true breeding to anything I touched with

1049
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,139
it was fire whether it was strawberry

1050
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:33,539
switchblade

1051
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:35,039
um what else the the the uh what I call

1052
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:38,759
it strawberry champagne which was the

1053
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:40,500
Clockwork cookies cut cross to um

1054
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,520
across to the east coast of our diesel

1055
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,880
strawberry cream

1056
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,199
uh there was a there was I didn't hit a

1057
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,700
lot of stuff during that because I was

1058
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,078
trying to do more selective breeding and

1059
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,598
only hitting certain females that I

1060
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,579
liked a lot with it

1061
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,140
but in doing that I came out with some

1062
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,640
stuff that I really loved and that

1063
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:58,199
strawberry switchblade was for sure one

1064
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,578
and it still goes around and cuts all

1065
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,899
over the place

1066
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,579
um yeah

1067
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,559
yeah I think that the strawberry

1068
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:06,960
switchblade has some mythological status

1069
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,239
within the Syndicate and it gets talked

1070
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,940
about quite a bit it was in magazines a

1071
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,699
lot too which like some of the stuff

1072
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,519
like Clockwork Orange and strawberry

1073
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:20,159
switchblade my Platinum banana OG my

1074
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,259
bubble work and what we'll talk about

1075
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,618
with the diesel work we're all featured

1076
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:28,260
in Skunk magazine heavily

1077
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:30,599
so a lot of that can I think contributed

1078
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,760
to its mythological status more than me

1079
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,099
or more than the strain necessarily

1080
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,400
earned on its own because

1081
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:41,220
back then in print was like

1082
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,440
every every grower and Breeder's goal

1083
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:45,779
you've got to get in High Times you've

1084
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,338
got to get in skunked that's your goal I

1085
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,859
mean that's when you made it you know

1086
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:52,920
like that was the thing and and for me

1087
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:54,960
by the time it was like those years 2010

1088
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,900
2011 I had already figured out the High

1089
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,720
Times okay right and I had already been

1090
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,240
told by Danny Danko at this point if you

1091
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:06,899
do not work with us you will never make

1092
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:08,219
it and I will guarantee it and at that

1093
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,180
point I was like

1094
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:14,939
[ __ ] you watch me watch me watch me

1095
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,980
[ __ ] watch me so I worked with

1096
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,539
skunk magazine extensively and that was

1097
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,760
because of the Rev and like we were

1098
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,039
homies and had I not been homies maybe

1099
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,920
that wouldn't have happened but thank

1100
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,800
goodness I thank goodness we were and

1101
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,780
it's crazy to think that like that era

1102
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,700
of print media

1103
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:36,480
kind of gatekeeping all this stuff

1104
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:40,078
wasn't that long ago no no it wasn't and

1105
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,460
and up until the the Marlies bought High

1106
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,000
Times I think

1107
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,400
it was still the standard that if you

1108
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,420
did not it's it's I mean maybe not as

1109
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,700
much now

1110
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,740
but up until fairly recently if you did

1111
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:55,019
not advertise in high times you didn't

1112
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,000
make it and for the most part if you do

1113
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,858
advertise in High Times now as a breeder

1114
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,960
you still make it

1115
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:04,139
yeah so it's still it's still looked at

1116
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,940
as a respectable source yeah and I'm

1117
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:07,699
still blacklisted so that's never gonna

1118
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,960
happen

1119
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:11,159
and I don't want it to I wouldn't want

1120
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,720
it to anyway you know what I mean like

1121
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,699
at this point yeah

1122
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,519
yeah I feel like it's definitely lost a

1123
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:19,858
lot of um it's shine with with other

1124
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:23,519
people in the community as well so yeah

1125
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:25,739
even and not to run to it you know

1126
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,480
you did mention the G's will work oh

1127
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:29,819
yeah maybe that's a good segue into the

1128
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,179
diesel work so the diesel I got really

1129
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,800
early on from Bodhi my friend body and I

1130
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:37,078
haven't talked about him as much yet

1131
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,760
with how much of an influence he was on

1132
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:43,019
my clone work

1133
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,820
um but he was a major major reason I had

1134
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:47,639
any of the rare clones from the online

1135
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,300
community that I did

1136
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,920
um

1137
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,320
and I guess I could talk about this part

1138
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,599
now because it is relevant

1139
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,140
um yeah during these years people were

1140
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,700
locking me out of cuts specifically

1141
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,618
uh well if people don't know what that

1142
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:03,179
means it means in the cut circles

1143
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,338
because there was still only a few clone

1144
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:07,379
circles that that really had the cuts

1145
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:09,539
the rare cuts and stuff like that

1146
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,000
when we were trading

1147
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:14,159
people would tell Bodhi or other

1148
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,260
breeders yeah you could have this but

1149
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,019
make sure Matt Wright doesn't get it

1150
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:22,440
and it was because I was doing fem work

1151
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:24,059
and they did not want their clones S1

1152
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,099
they did they thought that if I asked

1153
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,900
one of their clones the value would drop

1154
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:30,240
in their clones the trade value would be

1155
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,338
worthless and other people would grow it

1156
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,019
and their cropping would be hurt like

1157
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:35,639
their their money in their pocket would

1158
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,858
be hurt from cropping so don't give this

1159
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:40,679
to Matt Riot and in some in some

1160
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:43,440
respects I get that like I get why they

1161
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:44,699
thought that way at least in my mind if

1162
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,139
they understood breeding they would

1163
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:47,939
understand how hard it is to get the

1164
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:50,400
same representation of the same exact

1165
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:54,000
cut like that you know like

1166
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,519
it's asinine but I get why they thought

1167
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,500
that and a lot of times it would be

1168
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,579
people that I liked and that were my

1169
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,099
friends

1170
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,619
doing it to me

1171
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:06,780
and for people I considered friends

1172
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,338
doing it to me and locking me out of

1173
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,440
cuts because they wanted to protect

1174
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:12,358
their money and then it would be that

1175
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,440
awkward conversation where like yo bro

1176
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,838
like

1177
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,420
I get that you're you know you're a

1178
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,980
breeder and that it's not fair and it's

1179
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,659
kind of [ __ ] and it looks like I don't

1180
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,179
like you but

1181
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:27,059
I don't want you feminizing my cut and

1182
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:30,299
your words not good enough

1183
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:32,219
yeah I never ever did it never feminized

1184
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,900
anyone's anything that had any

1185
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:37,199
stipulations on anything but that never

1186
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,059
mattered it never mattered because the

1187
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,739
potential was there if it's in my hands

1188
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:42,179
for them to be scared

1189
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:45,059
and

1190
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:47,039
yeah that was a big big problem like as

1191
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:49,440
far as sourcing cuts it was very hard

1192
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,719
like I had to and I think it's a lot of

1193
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,639
why I I started this historian side of

1194
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:55,618
stuff and tried to get into anthropology

1195
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:58,078
was because I had to go to sources to

1196
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:01,500
get the cuts because it wasn't just like

1197
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,380
when people locked me out that I would

1198
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,300
just be like oh [ __ ] because I mean I

1199
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,059
feel like I should sign post here for

1200
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:12,420
everyone that you were one of the I

1201
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:15,539
guess pioneers of fem work reversals

1202
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:18,119
yeah yeah I mean yeah I guess like in in

1203
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:19,679
in American breeding

1204
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:21,300
there weren't a lot of us doing it there

1205
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,539
was OG rascal

1206
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,220
me CSI had done some work I believe Hyde

1207
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:28,318
had done some work Chimera had done some

1208
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:30,598
work uh and there were others but like

1209
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:34,259
as far as doing it big with a big name

1210
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,300
big name you know like one of the the

1211
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,400
top 50 breeders that were putting seeds

1212
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,780
out big there are only a few of us and

1213
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,519
nobody wanted to mess with Rascal

1214
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,500
because he was a gangster like he looked

1215
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,119
like a gangster like a gang banger like

1216
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,659
no he's gonna mess with Rascals except

1217
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,119
me like an [ __ ] we're friends now so

1218
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:55,078
yeah but like he didn't catch the Flack

1219
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,059
that I did but I caught so much [ __ ] and

1220
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:58,260
it didn't help because of my attitude

1221
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:59,578
because like when people would do that

1222
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,560
to me I'd be like okay [ __ ] you I'm

1223
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:03,300
gonna go to the source because you're

1224
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:05,099
making up roles on a clone that you have

1225
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,599
no rights to go to I'm gonna find out

1226
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:09,240
who the source is and I'm gonna go get

1227
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,640
it like yeah that's how this works and

1228
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,739
it didn't always work you know but a lot

1229
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:14,699
of times it did and that caused a lot of

1230
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:17,879
derision

1231
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:20,098
and delusion you know maybe like from my

1232
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,140
perspective like it caused some ego

1233
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,460
melting and hatred because all of a

1234
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:26,639
sudden the cut that they locked out

1235
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:29,338
locked me out of I got and I could pass

1236
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,379
freely because I went to the source of

1237
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:33,299
the person I said did you lock people

1238
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,160
out of this cut and 99 time they'd be

1239
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,280
like fun I don't care who has that cut I

1240
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:40,379
you know 99 of the time when you get to

1241
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,760
the source that's exactly how the source

1242
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,740
feels

1243
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,900
you know it's more people down the line

1244
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:47,719
that have no reason no permission to

1245
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:51,119
lock people out of cuts

1246
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:52,259
where that pops up

1247
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,838
yeah

1248
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,579
yeah and did you set the stage

1249
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,838
you're becoming an easy target as well

1250
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:02,160
unfortunately yeah my mouth didn't help

1251
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,199
because I'm very like people didn't know

1252
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,420
me know I you know like they see me on

1253
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:10,019
the breeder Syndicate now and me and not

1254
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:12,358
so talking and I try to be I like I'm I

1255
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:15,000
got a mouth like on there but I'm a very

1256
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,920
reserved version of who I used to be and

1257
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,159
that's some from growing up and

1258
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:23,400
experience right but I was very

1259
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,679
reactionary and I still can be I don't

1260
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,539
have much of an edit button but like

1261
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,539
when people challenge me

1262
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:32,759
it's not it's like I I've always had

1263
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:34,980
that in my life I was a short kid like a

1264
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,839
punk rock kid in an oil Community like

1265
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,760
oil worker Community when that's not

1266
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:40,019
acceptable like I've always had these

1267
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,140
challenges and people challenge me I

1268
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:44,940
push back hard and that doesn't bode

1269
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:47,818
well I mean do that to [ __ ] a

1270
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,519
thousand people online over you know two

1271
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:52,920
decades yeah people are gonna get super

1272
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:55,679
pissed you know like it doesn't do well

1273
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,119
and jesel was a cut from chem dog's crew

1274
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,639
and it was one of the ones that didn't

1275
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,720
have any stipulations so I got it from

1276
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:03,539
Podi

1277
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:06,779
and it was one of these cuts when I got

1278
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:09,000
it I realized holy [ __ ] this is skunky

1279
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,400
this is so skunky

1280
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,440
and during those years people weren't

1281
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,000
really looking for skunky stuff I mean

1282
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,858
some people were but it wasn't like all

1283
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,780
the rage roadkill skunk that people try

1284
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:20,880
to die for now right wasn't that I want

1285
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,640
to ask at this point as well like did it

1286
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,800
have much of a reputation at this point

1287
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:27,539
at all it would it was in the Canna

1288
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,920
Bible so people knew what it was that

1289
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:31,019
was the other thing like with clones

1290
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,818
like anything that made it in the Canna

1291
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:36,179
Bible from Jason King got legendary

1292
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:39,000
status so this was in there as one of

1293
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:42,179
the examples of the cam chem dog family

1294
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
but for whatever reason because it

1295
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:47,940
wasn't called chem or dog and it wasn't

1296
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,460
sour or something it flew under the red

1297
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,099
radar is diesel which meant G

1298
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,440
geez diesel like G is the chem dog's

1299
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:57,240
name like we call him G so G's diesel

1300
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,920
but it was called Gisele and just

1301
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:02,399
because the name I think it wasn't a

1302
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,680
catchy name it just never caught on but

1303
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,440
it was passed to a few people and those

1304
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:09,239
few people were great Growers and loved

1305
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,838
it because they saw all the skunkiness

1306
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:15,299
in it and uh it's a hard grow it's not

1307
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:18,539
super Frosty it can harm

1308
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,800
so a lot of people dropped it it's paid

1309
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:22,079
no attention to it and over the years

1310
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,480
that's kind of what happened and so I

1311
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,400
started working with it and the lines

1312
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,619
that I worked with it were super

1313
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,680
resinous and super Frosty and super

1314
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:34,260
skunky and they you know those gotten

1315
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,179
skunk magazine some of those got a claim

1316
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,640
um we did

1317
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,338
jesel crossed to a West Coast dog Suge

1318
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,179

1319
00:48:40,338 --> 00:48:44,759

1320
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:47,879
uh what else we did jesel cross to

1321
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:51,540
something called chemdog D DNL diesel

1322
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,700
Northern Lights from um JJ New York

1323
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:57,300
um we did

1324
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:59,639
I mean diesel Blue Bonnet later on uh

1325
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,200
diesel East Coast our diesel strawberry

1326
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:02,639
cream

1327
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,739
um I don't think we ever did A Clockwork

1328
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,539
diesel Unfortunately they were never in

1329
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:09,598
the room flowering at the same time to

1330
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:12,719
do it so pretty much jesel is like

1331
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,640
become one of my loves of my life like I

1332
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:17,279
love the smoke of it I love how it

1333
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,559
breeds it is what I believe is a great

1334
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,720
representation of a of a of a super

1335
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,219
skunk from Neville

1336
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:25,139
um yeah

1337
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:26,459
and I mean on that note and I you can

1338
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:28,739
cut this out if you don't want people to

1339
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,539
know this here but there you have been

1340
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:32,639
dropping hence that you might be

1341
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,818
returning to some diesel work with CSI

1342
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:39,358
oh yeah yeah I know that's fine um yeah

1343
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:41,940
uh CSI I tried convincing him for years

1344
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,739
so he had the cut in 2006 and totally

1345
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,480
forgot that he ever had the cut but like

1346
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:48,779
it's on his clone list you know of stuff

1347
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,858
he had so yeah he just forgot what was

1348
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,900
like and stuff and he didn't even

1349
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:53,400
remember he ran it didn't care

1350
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,680
um but I kept bugging him for years I'm

1351
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,280
like dude you have got to try this cut

1352
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,838
like it's so good and so skunky and you

1353
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,099
know I mean like he gets told that by

1354
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:05,338
hundreds of people all the time about

1355
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:07,260
Cuts so it took me three years and years

1356
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:07,920
and then he finally you know gave it a

1357
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,800
whirl

1358
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,900
and he's like holy [ __ ] this thing's

1359
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,880
great like he's not a diesel fan in the

1360
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,980
first place he doesn't like sour

1361
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,400
um he doesn't like smoking sour not a

1362
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:22,318
fan of how it breeds really and so the

1363
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,338
fact that it was more like of a diesel

1364
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:29,279
Lee type cut than it is by terp wise

1365
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:31,318
more of a diesel type cut and looks than

1366
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,500
it would be considered a chem type cut

1367
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:36,659
and in smell it's not chemi necessarily

1368
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,460
it's skunky but not like burnt tennis

1369
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,598
ball rubber

1370
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,679
um he just didn't seem to have much

1371
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,800
interest but he got it he's like oh my

1372
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:47,639
God this is great and so we are doing a

1373
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:50,220
uh an S ones and a full reverse line

1374
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:52,920
together of jesel to bring it back and

1375
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:54,779
to bring some big time diesel reverse

1376
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,940
back and and cry babies done some work

1377
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,680
with it as well and like I you know I

1378
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,019
passed the cut to people in our crew to

1379
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,179
like bitter and cry babies got it now

1380
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:05,519
and denali's got it people people are

1381
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:07,980
running it I think um Pax running it too

1382
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,940
uh Santa Cruz goat farm so a lot of

1383
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,699
people are going to be doing a lot of

1384
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,039
diesel stuff and and and that's all

1385
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:16,199
because of Bodhi really I mean he kept

1386
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:18,838
the cut forever and passed it to me and

1387
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:20,399
without Bodhi doing that I never would

1388
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:21,779
have had it and all these other people

1389
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,318
wouldn't have had it so shout out to

1390
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,319
Bodie

1391
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,338
I think it's really cool that you get to

1392
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,780
return to it um again and yeah I'm so

1393
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:32,039
like life was a bit like that I don't

1394
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,200
know if you feel this way but I feel

1395
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:35,759
like life sometimes works in spirals you

1396
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:37,078
know you kind of come back but it's not

1397
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,839
exactly the same but you're still back

1398
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,818
in the same place it feels like yeah

1399
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,799
um and it makes me feel happy that like

1400
00:51:41,818 --> 00:51:45,900
because a lot of people don't know but

1401
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,700
me and CSI we've been very good friends

1402
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,800
for

1403
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:51,838
five or six years now I think really

1404
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,339
close friends but before that we weren't

1405
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,199
like we weren't enemies but we just

1406
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:57,659
didn't really talk much I would try to

1407
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,939
poke in and um this is one of those

1408
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:02,460
stories where it's like a almost like a

1409
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,800
teaching regret story right

1410
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,740
and it's one that I tell to newcomers

1411
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,900
when they make similar mistakes

1412
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:13,439
and

1413
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:16,139
I when I first heard about CSI and saw

1414
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,440
what he was doing I was enamored with

1415
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:21,779
his breeding skill and his knowledge and

1416
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,639
his ability to to hunt down history and

1417
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,579
and even on his old Forum posts which

1418
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:28,379
were around back then to look at

1419
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:31,079
watching him just level people that

1420
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,358
would try to scam they would try to just

1421
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,440
be corrupt he would level them and he

1422
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,199
would level them with their own words

1423
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:40,400
and let them do it and just ask like two

1424
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:42,539
two word questions and let them

1425
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,639
disassemble themselves in front of

1426
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:46,800
everyone it was It's Magic to watch and

1427
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:49,318
he can still do it but he does it less

1428
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,940
you know because of the the Flack that I

1429
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:52,679
caught the fact that he caught you know

1430
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,659
like people were [ __ ] nuts when you

1431
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:56,279
do this to him

1432
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:57,899
um but I would love to go dig through

1433
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,819
the Forum archives with some of those

1434
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,099
and they're not most of them aren't even

1435
00:52:59,818 --> 00:53:05,279
there anymore which sucks yeah all those

1436
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:06,000
forms are gone you know most of them but

1437
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,240
um

1438
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,619
yeah so like I I I I wasn't enamored

1439
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:13,139
with his work so I sent him a message

1440
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:16,440
early on and I was like hey

1441
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:18,118
I am good friends with blank and it was

1442
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,220
someone I thought that he was super

1443
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,920
close with and that I knew had gotten

1444
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:24,598
clones of CSI stuff

1445
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,220
so I assume that they must be super

1446
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,720
close I know that this dude's gone to

1447
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:30,659
his house and he says they're good

1448
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:33,058
friends so I'm like okay I'm gonna name

1449
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:35,519
drop this person that's a good friend of

1450
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:38,099
mine that I've done like I've given him

1451
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,440
money I've given it like his truck was

1452
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:42,900
getting impounded so I [ __ ] let him

1453
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,519
stick his name on a collab and sell

1454
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,500
seats to a seed bank and give him all

1455
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:48,559
the seeds for free to keep the money you

1456
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,179
know like things like this big things

1457
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:53,760
and I assume this was a very good friend

1458
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:55,318
of mine so I said this is a mutual

1459
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,359
friend

1460
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:59,460
I would love to speak to you more dude I

1461
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,139
really really into what you do well

1462
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,400
this is where that moral of the story

1463
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:04,799
comes in

1464
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,960
always be careful how you introduce

1465
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,780
yourself to people because you never

1466
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,280
know what their real impression is of

1467
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,980
the person you're name dropping if you

1468
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,319
name drop a person and you only have one

1469
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,780
chance to make a first impression

1470
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:22,500
and if you name drop someone

1471
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,220
that is bad and a scammer and all that

1472
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,440
[ __ ]

1473
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:27,000
no one's going to talk to you and for 10

1474
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,440
years he stayed away from me because of

1475
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
that because he's super careful like he

1476
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,858
doesn't want to invite chaos in his life

1477
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,619
and I don't blame him like he's a busy

1478
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:36,659
man you know like yeah yeah he doesn't

1479
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:39,480
do the Forum drama stuff anymore at all

1480
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:42,779
like it's just not in his life so

1481
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:45,000
he was very hesitant to talk to me so

1482
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,200
several years ago Emerald cup we had a

1483
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,579
booth next to each other I was working

1484
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:52,558
with NCGA and splitting a booth and I I

1485
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:54,839
noticed CSI was next to me

1486
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,180
at the booth so and he never really

1487
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,558
responded to my message and I knew he

1488
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:00,539
had seen it

1489
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,339
and through other people I had heard

1490
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:05,099
that he didn't like what I had to say

1491
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:06,779
about like males and Femme seeds and

1492
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:08,519
stuff like that which and in the end he

1493
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,700
was correct he was absolutely correct

1494
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:13,679
and I was a noob so

1495
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:15,539
he had all these other Notions about me

1496
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,299
so I went up and I shook his hand said

1497
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:19,980
hi I'm Matt all right seeds uh really

1498
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,240

1499
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,679

1500
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:24,479
that was it

1501
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:26,098
walked away sat down because I knew he

1502
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,599
was busy like I was busy people were

1503
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,800
coming up grabbing seeds you don't want

1504
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,240
to take too much of people's time from

1505
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,380
there this is where they make the most

1506
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,199
money in the year

1507
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,960
and so after that

1508
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:39,118
um he messaged me or he emailed me

1509
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,159
or no it was on Instagram

1510
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,960
he messaged me and he's like hey here's

1511
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:45,118
my number hit me up

1512
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,380
and so we talked and he explained you

1513
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,318
know some of the preconceived notions

1514
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:52,920
and he said he really respected that

1515
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:56,338
despite all of that that I still came up

1516
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,838
shook his hand like a man and and walked

1517
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:00,119
and didn't like say hey why didn't you

1518
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:02,039
do this why didn't you email me back you

1519
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,838
know like any petty [ __ ] it was just

1520
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:04,920
like man dude hey dude I respect you and

1521
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:06,358
that's that

1522
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,338
Annie appreciated that and then we

1523
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,338
started talking and and

1524
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:12,960
quickly became best of friends I mean

1525
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:14,639
you know we're very close friends our

1526
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,220
group's big we're all best friends in

1527
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:19,019
our group but yeah I mean like uh we're

1528
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:20,818
very close and he's one of the people I

1529
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:22,858
would do anything for and and it was

1530
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:25,800
weird because I went from going from

1531
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:29,578
someone who is an absolute fanboy

1532
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:31,740
Fanboy extreme like because there's no

1533
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:33,660
one bad in my mind still there's no one

1534
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:35,879
better in cannabis that's ever done it

1535
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:37,500
not Rob Clark not anyone no offense to

1536
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,740
Rob because I think he's a god of

1537
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:43,318
cannabis but as far as breeding work

1538
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:46,199
showing it having all of it

1539
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:48,420
and and the amount of reading work the

1540
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:51,419
real reading work that's gone in and the

1541
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,460
years of it no one's done it more no one

1542
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:57,000
does it better no one's done it more

1543
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:59,818
precise and to go from that to being

1544
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,280
someone's close friend and a man and men

1545
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:04,259
and he mentors me in ways like teaches

1546
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,660
me things and I get to learn from him

1547
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:08,099
that is a mind-blowing process that's

1548
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:11,940
happened to me a few times over the

1549
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:16,338
years and despite all of the

1550
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:19,440
opinions online about me and the the

1551
00:57:16,338 --> 00:57:21,179
magnitude of [ __ ] disgust that it

1552
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,818
seems like people have I've been

1553
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:25,919
fortunate to work with who I have

1554
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:29,579
yeah and we will come back to some of

1555
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,800
those events as well but yeah that your

1556
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:34,380
friendship with uh CSI sounds really

1557
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,599
special yeah and the same goes for Bodhi

1558
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,680
too because like I hold body in the same

1559
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:40,260
esteem

1560
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,899
and he was probably the main inspiration

1561
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,700
for what I made and what I worked with

1562
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,680
early on even before we were close

1563
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:48,659
friends I just saw what he was doing and

1564
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:50,098
I thought God that guy's so cool he's

1565
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:52,500
doing something no one else is doing

1566
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:54,300
what like purple kush double purple Doja

1567
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,400
this isn't what the Dutch people are

1568
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,680
working with this is freaking cool you

1569
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,480
know it's beautiful and so he was a

1570
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,818
major inspiration for my early work and

1571
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,480
it was the same kind of deal we became

1572
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:09,119
friends and slowly became very close and

1573
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,980
over the years definitely a mentor in my

1574
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,720
life a hundred thousand percent of

1575
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,780
Mentor in my life not just with breeding

1576
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:17,519
but in life how to deal with people how

1577
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:19,800
things how we should look at things his

1578
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,380
perspective is so unique he's a

1579
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:25,019
beautiful human so yeah

1580
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,480
no really cool and yeah those two

1581
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:30,599
figures especially definitely strike me

1582
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,760
even as someone who's this far away

1583
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:34,559
um as being really special spirits and

1584
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,180
you know in the community and it's crazy

1585
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,880
but also you know they they both

1586
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,558
recognize you and what you were doing so

1587
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,298
that's that's really that's a that's

1588
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,298
that's a trip and it's an honor and and

1589
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:47,818
to this day I still have trouble

1590
00:58:44,298 --> 00:58:50,280
wondering you better believe it dude

1591
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:52,558
yeah I just it's hard to understand why

1592
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,839
you know what I mean but it's I I

1593
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,880
nonetheless I respect them and I thank

1594
00:58:54,838 --> 00:59:00,199
them you know like it's not like uh

1595
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,200
something I've ever overlooked

1596
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:04,740
very sweet

1597
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:07,259
all right so we've got a big one coming

1598
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:09,959
up which is about all your blueberry

1599
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:11,760
work and and how you encountered it to

1600
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,199
begin with and why you decided to keep

1601
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,640
going with it

1602
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:16,439
um we did talk about the fact that you

1603
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,838
might still want to have a dedicated

1604
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,400
blueberry episode later on so maybe this

1605
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:21,719
can be like a miniaturized version oh

1606
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,858
yeah yeah

1607
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:25,858
so

1608
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:28,500
blueberry the first blueberry I ever

1609
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:30,179
smoked was from this I won't say his

1610
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,858
name because this is like we were doing

1611
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:34,798
a lot of other dirt

1612
00:59:31,858 --> 00:59:37,078
um this dude in town and it was after

1613
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:39,059
the medical clubs it all opened up so

1614
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:42,298
this is like 2000

1615
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:45,359
three or four and he was bringing in

1616
00:59:42,298 --> 00:59:48,358
kilos and kilos and kilos of [ __ ] um

1617
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:51,119
blueberry and it was phenomenal

1618
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:52,739
blueberry it wasn't

1619
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,180
it had a blueberry flavor that would

1620
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:56,279
Zing the tip of your tongue it's so hard

1621
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:58,500
to describe but it wasn't as blueberry

1622
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,700
smelling as what I love in blueberry but

1623
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,659
the fact that it was seeing the tip of

1624
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:03,118
your tongue and had a little bit of a

1625
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:05,159
blueberry taste was just phenomenal and

1626
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,440
it had a great high so it was one of the

1627
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:09,598
ones that I smoked very early on that I

1628
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,159
was chasing so when I started buying

1629
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:15,240
seeds and learning that you could import

1630
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:17,699
seeds from Amsterdam and and actually

1631
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:21,358
the beginning of that seed buying

1632
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:22,919
experience the UK became very big it was

1633
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:25,619
the end of importing seeds from

1634
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,298
Amsterdam direct and when the UKC Bank

1635
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:30,480
started popping up and one of those

1636
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:32,940
early ones was like seed Madness uh UK

1637
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,260
seed Madness dot Co dot UK not sure if

1638
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,240
they're still around and if they are I'm

1639
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,619
not sure that that's the same URL that

1640
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,199
that's what it was during those years

1641
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:42,420
they were great people nice people not

1642
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:44,219
scammers and maybe a few years after

1643
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,019
that like the attitude popped up but

1644
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:48,480
during the years these years a lot of

1645
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:51,358
the the seed banks were on forums and

1646
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,338
they were small British forums where

1647
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:54,659
people bought their seeds yeah and

1648
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:56,699
they're not around anymore to look at

1649
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:59,279
none of them hot pant

1650
01:00:56,699 --> 01:01:00,598
um canazon kinetics

1651
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,180
Cali

1652
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:07,200
something rather it was a bunch of

1653
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:09,058
little tiny seed banks like that

1654
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,759
and

1655
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:12,839
um that's where I I went to seed

1656
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,760
madness.co.uk and that's where I bought

1657
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:17,639
all of my DJ Short Stuff

1658
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,960
and I remember I had gotten a big bonus

1659
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:24,000
at Sony

1660
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,199
and I spent a large chunk all at once on

1661
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,920
blueberry

1662
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:27,919
flow

1663
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:34,980
very flow

1664
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:38,240
f13 Coco Kush

1665
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,240
Vanna Luna

1666
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,660
I think those are the main four there

1667
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:44,579
might be an oh great Crush

1668
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:47,519
those are the big five that I bought

1669
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:51,480
early on those five

1670
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:54,838
um and Dougie had a clone of blue velvet

1671
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:58,740
Blue Heaven and blue moonshine

1672
01:01:54,838 --> 01:02:02,058
so I got to run all this stuff and

1673
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:05,399
after spending a

1674
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:07,980
ridiculous amount of money so much money

1675
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:11,039
on blueberry

1676
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:13,380
I didn't find much that I liked I found

1677
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,659
one can I get you to pause there I just

1678
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:19,440
wanted to ask you like how why were you

1679
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:22,019
interested in those lines to begin with

1680
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,358
because of that that zing on my tongue

1681
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:26,099
that was like literally like it was

1682
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:28,318
unique I never had that and it was like

1683
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:29,400
wow that's what blueberry is I'd like to

1684
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:31,019
I'd like to

1685
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,720
check that out again

1686
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:34,920
and um that that was literally it it

1687
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:36,598
wasn't even the blueberry smelling

1688
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,818
cannabis that I had quite experienced

1689
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:41,460
yet that it like been like oh my God I'm

1690
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:43,739
obsessed but the other thing was DJ

1691
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:46,260
shorts books

1692
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:48,539
and pictures they were the most

1693
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:50,160
beautiful plants I had ever seen in my

1694
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:52,739
life they were

1695
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,980
beautiful purple the leaves were purple

1696
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:58,439
purple how they grew was real unique

1697
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:01,500
um they were just so unique looking that

1698
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,818
it was just it stood out in cannabis so

1699
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,199
much during this era there weren't

1700
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:07,019
really a lot of purples you received

1701
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:09,419
there was um not a lot of purple Urkel

1702
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:12,780
work online some

1703
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,980
you know but um there was a purples are

1704
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,200
kind of rare so things like double

1705
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:19,318
purple Doja popping up and sputting it

1706
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:22,739
one and two those kind of purples were

1707
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:25,318
and blackberry stuff or rare hard to get

1708
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:27,598
and people were chasing it and it was

1709
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:29,940
being kind of gate kept and DJ shorts

1710
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,338
work was another way to get into purples

1711
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:34,679
and breed with purples but we all knew

1712
01:03:32,338 --> 01:03:36,239
it would take selection because we had

1713
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:38,159
heard you know that maybe you won't find

1714
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:41,279
stuff you like in every pack of DJ

1715
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,739
shorts the the major problem I had was

1716
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,380
the seed germination rate was very very

1717
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:48,298
very low like we're talking

1718
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,500
four or five packs of one thing didn't

1719
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:52,858
pop at all

1720
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:54,000
and I germ rate by this time my germ my

1721
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:54,900
germ skills at this time were really

1722
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,139
good

1723
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:01,380
and hog was helping me pop these and his

1724
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:03,900
were excellent so it was like I can look

1725
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:07,200
back and say probably not my fault this

1726
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,280
time and later on normal to have that

1727
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:12,298
kind of

1728
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:15,119
germ rate even for that time barely yeah

1729
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:16,739
like the seeds that were the seeds you

1730
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,599
would get in packs dude during that time

1731
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:21,899
probably even now I don't know I don't

1732
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:23,940
buy other readers packs they were they

1733
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,099
were a lot of immature seeds in here

1734
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:28,619
like not just small because small seeds

1735
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:30,539
can be mature right small seeds come

1736
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:32,338
from all plants

1737
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:34,079
um some plants have only small seeds

1738
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:37,679
small black ones with no tiger stripes

1739
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,298
some are big fat gray and modeled with

1740
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,098
no tiger stripes

1741
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:44,460
tiger stripe for people that don't know

1742
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:46,140
are is a thin layer of sheath that can

1743
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,460
come off the skin like the husk if

1744
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:49,019
people don't if people don't know that

1745
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,838
so like it's not necessarily A

1746
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:53,699
descriptor of maturity but it's a great

1747
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:55,259
way to tell and look you know it looks

1748
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:56,759
better when they're all like that but

1749
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,460
the seeds you would get in these packs

1750
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,260
were just totally immature no wait or

1751
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,000
heft to them you could squish them pop

1752
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,099
them in your fingers with no problem you

1753
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,519
know things like that so that was common

1754
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:12,420
but five packs that was not common and

1755
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:14,818
what ended up happening later on was

1756
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,858
they had to replace every single DJ

1757
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:18,480
Short pack that they sold during this

1758
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:20,578
era

1759
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,858
for every customer because everyone was

1760
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:24,298
having these germ raids so yeah it

1761
01:05:22,858 --> 01:05:27,539
wasn't just me at this time it ended up

1762
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:28,500
being a big deal for the UK buyers

1763
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:30,420
um

1764
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:32,519
let's see what else was there

1765
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:36,720
so we went through those I found two

1766
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:38,460
flow clones that I kept and I had an f13

1767
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:41,639
that I really liked I thought was

1768
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,679
beautiful but no blueberries there was

1769
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:47,460
nothing that was that was Hardcore

1770
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,318
blueberry nothing that was berry berry

1771
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,940
berry smelling and that was

1772
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:52,440
disappointing to me because I thought

1773
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:54,240
like

1774
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,858
that if you go through enough of his

1775
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:57,838
stuff you're gonna find berry berry

1776
01:05:55,858 --> 01:06:00,298
berry right like

1777
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:02,159
I was excited I spent a lot of money and

1778
01:06:00,298 --> 01:06:04,199
what I got I got a few beautiful plants

1779
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,500
I got some that smelled like floral

1780
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:10,139
incense floral incense and slight Berry

1781
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,358
like the slightest

1782
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:14,400
you know but by this time I had already

1783
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:16,440
smelled the Dabney blue cut a little bit

1784
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,420
which was blueberry muffins a little bit

1785
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,579
and I thought this is phenomenal I know

1786
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,460
there's better I know there's better and

1787
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:27,480
shortly after this a guy named estartes

1788
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:31,019
from um a form called pop pimp gave me

1789
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:33,900
DJ's mom cut of blueberry

1790
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:35,818
and this one had more Berry to it and

1791
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,579
was purple and beautiful and it can

1792
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:40,139
breed Berry plants not often but it can

1793
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:40,980
right

1794
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:42,358
um

1795
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:44,639
so yeah that's when we started the berry

1796
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:47,940
Obsession in the berry work eventually I

1797
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:51,179
was working at a place called BCC

1798
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:53,700
as their Master grower that's what the

1799
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:54,960
title they gave me master grower at

1800
01:06:53,699 --> 01:06:56,338
their Collective

1801
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,798
um to grow and they were letting me

1802
01:06:56,338 --> 01:07:00,798
breed at the time and someone brought in

1803
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:05,219
a

1804
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:06,780
a jar of Bud and when I got this bud I

1805
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:09,899
smelled it and smelled like peanut

1806
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:12,420
butter it was amazing like like Jiffy

1807
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,980
sweet creamy peanut butter and I was

1808
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,720
like oh my God and it had seeds in it I

1809
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,039
was like dude uh to that I was like dude

1810
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:18,179
let me pick these seeds out and he's

1811
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,280
like yeah just be careful you pick them

1812
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:21,838
out and I was like okay cool so I

1813
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,619
uncarefully picked them out destroyed

1814
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,119
the bud

1815
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:25,440
because that's what you have to do to

1816
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:27,599
get all the good seats you know destroy

1817
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,760
the [ __ ] out of the bud and I asked I

1818
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,960
was like hey dude what is this he said

1819
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,220
um because it was being sold to

1820
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,539
Strawberry Cough and I knew that he

1821
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:35,098
changed that [ __ ] all the time like I'll

1822
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:36,720
collected I said so what is this he said

1823
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:37,920
we only had a strawberry cough but they

1824
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,179
brought it in his blueberry but it

1825
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,798
doesn't smell like blueberry I was like

1826
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:42,419
okay so I made a mental note you know

1827
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,699
they said it was blueberry whatever this

1828
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,960
is peanut butter this is great so I took

1829
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,338
those Seeds home

1830
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,519
popped them

1831
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:52,318
and out came the most purple

1832
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:56,699
blueberry

1833
01:07:52,318 --> 01:08:00,058
smelling tasting plants I have ever seen

1834
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:02,219
by this up to this point it was it

1835
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:04,859
looked like what What DJ Short had shown

1836
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:07,139
as Oregon purple tie back in the day

1837
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:08,578
and it was purple blueberry zero peanut

1838
01:08:07,139 --> 01:08:10,500
butter in it now some of the other

1839
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:13,200
parents were Frosty peanut butter

1840
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,940
Afghani type plants with this one

1841
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,039
had more what people would consider

1842
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:20,520
narrow Leaf traits

1843
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,500
and just purple blueberry and this is

1844
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,779
the cut that I originally named right

1845
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:27,140
Berry and that I used for all of my

1846
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:30,900
earliest blueberry work

1847
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:32,880
so this was like in in a way you the

1848
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:35,219
very first moment of actually having

1849
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,500
what you were looking for this is the

1850
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:39,659
moment where I was like this is the one

1851
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:42,600
with the taste and smell of blueberry in

1852
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:46,139
the looks but what it didn't have was

1853
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:50,640
any sort of potency but what it did have

1854
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:54,179
was medical relevance what I noticed so

1855
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,039
when I realized this I was out of all my

1856
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:57,779
weed and I had a tooth abscess at the

1857
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:00,479
time and I was like in tears and pain

1858
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:03,239
right I didn't have dental insurance

1859
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:05,039
nothing I was in pain it was my very

1860
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:06,899
first tooth abscess I didn't know what

1861
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:09,179
was going on but I felt like I was dying

1862
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:12,719
and I S and you know like ibuprofen

1863
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:14,460
wasn't helping nothing so I smoked some

1864
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,020
Riot bear because it was all I had and I

1865
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:17,159
expected nothing to happen it was just

1866
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,380
what I had

1867
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:21,119
and immediately the nerve pain went away

1868
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,119
from that tooth

1869
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:26,579
and I wasn't in pain and I was like holy

1870
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:28,198
[ __ ] this is magical you know amazing

1871
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:30,359
and then when other people I saw I

1872
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:32,818
started giving it to other people in the

1873
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:34,859
um in the crew that had like back pains

1874
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:36,420
nerve pains and they were experiencing

1875
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:39,539
the same thing they were getting

1876
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:41,819
anti-anxiety effects and complete relief

1877
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:44,100
from nerve pain but they didn't they

1878
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:46,798
didn't get high and at all so they could

1879
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,779
go to work do stuff

1880
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,880
my goal was to make some potency with

1881
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:53,219
this so I crossed it into an OG Kush

1882
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,380
Pakistani to trolley regular sea lion

1883
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:57,600
that I had for a male side and I made

1884
01:09:55,380 --> 01:10:00,000
what became called Riot Barry OG

1885
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,400
and from there I selected oh actually I

1886
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,880
didn't even select this one a dude named

1887
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:07,439
Jeremiah selected a clone from that and

1888
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:10,199
he gave it back to me and that's what I

1889
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:13,439
used in my lines is Riot Barry OG and

1890
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:14,599
almost every line from from

1891
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:18,678
um

1892
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:21,480
2008 on or no I'm sorry 2010 on would be

1893
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:24,420
with the riot Berry OG

1894
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:26,099
yeah strict yeah so would this be like

1895
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,739
your first generation I guess of

1896
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:30,480
blueberry work it would be because I did

1897
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:32,939
release the riot Berry seeds originally

1898
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:35,099
right yeah I guess separately true and I

1899
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:37,259
think I even gave out a bunch of the bad

1900
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:39,239
seeds that I had left is there a

1901
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:42,800
shitload of seeds in that jar so I even

1902
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:46,379
gave those seeds out but uh I I made

1903
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,840
f2s of original Riot Berry so what I

1904
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:51,119
thought would be a blueberry version of

1905
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,679
that clone in male form which I who

1906
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:54,899
knows to this day if it was correct but

1907
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:56,819
it made a nice Berry line so the right

1908
01:10:54,899 --> 01:10:58,679
Berry was the first one but Riot Barry

1909
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:00,779
OG was where I was like [ __ ] slam it

1910
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:03,060
out of the park this is potent enough to

1911
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:04,859
be relevant Frost it to everything see

1912
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:06,659
how it breeds and it was true breeding

1913
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:09,179
for the blueberry tree this is where I

1914
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:12,059
made things like blueberry cookies uh

1915
01:11:09,179 --> 01:11:14,399
which we call Cookie Berry and which is

1916
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:16,920
probably my most knocked off line today

1917
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:19,559
like renamed we made something called

1918
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,179
cookie Berry diesel which was during my

1919
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:25,199
uh when we were doing the day record

1920
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:27,779
these diesel bx1 for the male side when

1921
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:30,599
we're crossing that to everything that's

1922
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:32,399
when I made the cookie Berry Diesel and

1923
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,500
um that was crossing cookie barrier best

1924
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:37,559
selection of the cookie Berry which was

1925
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:39,840
the right Berry OG Berry dominant Fino

1926
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:43,080
cross to Girl Scout cookies form cut

1927
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,819
reversed in 2011 made those and then

1928
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:47,340
crossed that to the original diesel bx1

1929
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:49,259
which was the project following

1930
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:51,840
um

1931
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:54,659
um the the cookies reversal

1932
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:57,779
so am I right I'm thinking as well that

1933
01:11:54,658 --> 01:12:01,920
you one of the earlier people to

1934
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:05,399
work with cookies yeah um in 2010

1935
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:08,819
cookies kind of popped up and by 2011 it

1936
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:10,379
was almost a race to some people to get

1937
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:12,420
it put out

1938
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:15,300
um I it became a race when people found

1939
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:17,699
out that I got the cut from lumpy and

1940
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:19,199
was making s1s because like there

1941
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:21,299
weren't many people feminizing at that

1942
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:22,919
point and

1943
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,539
um

1944
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,239
and that they knew I was gonna put it

1945
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:29,460
out pure right so first person to put

1946
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:31,559
out anything cookies that I recall was a

1947
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:33,539
company called can adventure and they

1948
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:37,380
put out a cookies crossed to some sort

1949
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:38,880
of train wreck hybrid right so

1950
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,100
it was like I think they called it

1951
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,679
cookie wreck well

1952
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:45,840
not even two months later my reversal is

1953
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,158
done and we're testing it like we're

1954
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,000
already in the middle of testing by that

1955
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:54,658
point and I have train wreck cross to

1956
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,920
cookies I have cookies crossed to pretty

1957
01:12:54,658 --> 01:12:57,238
much everything in my room at that point

1958
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,039
because I want to see how this unique

1959
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:01,019
weird plant that people are obsessing

1960
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:03,899
over parades would be the first person

1961
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:06,360
to see how it raids reversed

1962
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:08,759
um so I put out the cookies pure and

1963
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:10,559
then not even a week later swerve from

1964
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,020
Cali Connection put out his version of

1965
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,360
cookies Femmes which when people

1966
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,760
actually and and people were buying his

1967
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:20,399
versus mine When people grew his out it

1968
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:24,000
was just OG Kush and we're super pissed

1969
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:26,698
and BC Bud Depot within a week like the

1970
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,500
same week as mine came out put out their

1971
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:30,899
version of cookies and animal cookies

1972
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,300
because I did cookies and I almost put

1973
01:13:30,899 --> 01:13:34,920
out the animal cookies s ones but I but

1974
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,900
at the last minute after I made them

1975
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,359
someone said that I'm not allowed to so

1976
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:41,698
I didn't uh NorCal I see mag thank you

1977
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:42,899
for that one because uh he said I wasn't

1978
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:45,719
allowed to

1979
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:46,379
so I didn't but

1980
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:48,779
um

1981
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,340
yeah uh BC Bud Depot released a fake

1982
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:52,738
version of animal cookies which ruined

1983
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:54,179
that line and name and then they also

1984
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:56,399
put out a fake version of cookies too

1985
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:58,679
but like I said when this happens

1986
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,960
people just jumped to the cheapest or

1987
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:02,699
who has the biggest name but that

1988
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,859
doesn't necessarily mean any of those

1989
01:14:02,698 --> 01:14:06,059
people have the Clone because they're

1990
01:14:04,859 --> 01:14:07,439
the ones who are advertising in High

1991
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:10,080
Times and get the first sales doesn't

1992
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:12,000
mean that they have the ability to get

1993
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:14,399
the Clone or the morals to do it

1994
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,319
correctly and that's what people saw but

1995
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,819
it took almost a year you know for

1996
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:20,698
people to grow these things out and see

1997
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:23,819
who actually had the legit [ __ ]

1998
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:25,319
and by that time in that year other

1999
01:14:23,819 --> 01:14:27,000
people had gotten it and were starting

2000
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:27,960
to make crosses and release them with a

2001
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,238
real cut

2002
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:33,000
and what I had done with it meant

2003
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:35,879
nothing you know and and by that time

2004
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,380
when I when everybody got the cut I

2005
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,140
didn't want my name to be associated

2006
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:41,760
with it anymore so it was like I'm gonna

2007
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:44,280
sink back into the Shadows that I even

2008
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,719
use this [ __ ] you know like instead of

2009
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:48,719
trying to be like nah man I was the

2010
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:50,939
first that I was just like like nah you

2011
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:54,239
all have it I'm good it was the same way

2012
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:55,678
with like working with gelato 33 you

2013
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:59,218
know I was the first one of the first

2014
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:01,440
with that cut and the first to make s1s

2015
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:03,420
the first to make gelato 33 with with

2016
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,658
Skittles and [ __ ] and

2017
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:08,158
which became runs and I'm like

2018
01:15:05,658 --> 01:15:09,839
you know I don't want anything to do

2019
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:12,779
with this stuff

2020
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,699
um but it was the reason I say that now

2021
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:16,979
is because in retrospect it just became

2022
01:15:14,698 --> 01:15:18,299
hype stuff when I was doing it I wanted

2023
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,519
to see what was in it because nobody

2024
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:23,100
else was working with it it was unique

2025
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,780
yeah of course yeah and so okay coming

2026
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,820
coming back then to you a blueberry

2027
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:29,519
Journey after cookie Berry

2028
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:32,519
what happens after that so after cookie

2029
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:35,760
Berry and the right Berry OG stuff I

2030
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:38,340
lost my my right very OG mom the the

2031
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,840
blueberry one in a um a plate I got I

2032
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,940
got this plague of

2033
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,460
something which probably was hplv

2034
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:46,079
looking back but a plague of something

2035
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:48,060
killed every mom in my room including

2036
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:50,880
that from taking clones in from outside

2037
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:53,460
clones and not being fastidious enough

2038
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,920
and using the same razor blade [ __ ] like

2039
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:57,840
that just being not being fastidious

2040
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,219
because most people weren't the time if

2041
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,319
you're if I'm being real like we didn't

2042
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:03,179
know about hplv and all that [ __ ] so

2043
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:05,399
that took out the mom and I was like

2044
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:07,739
okay I've made the best blueberry [ __ ] I

2045
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:09,839
could ever make I'm done I can move on

2046
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:11,099
and that's when I moved on to Strawberry

2047
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,900
work right

2048
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:18,420
but I sold out of all of these seeds

2049
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:20,339
people bought all of my seeds and during

2050
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:23,340
these years

2051
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:25,380
I wasn't making a lot of money so like I

2052
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:27,480
was literally selling every last pack of

2053
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:29,940
everything I had and because I'm not a

2054
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:30,899
[ __ ] bag like I like to think I'm not I

2055
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:33,779
didn't

2056
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:36,119
continue to pretend I had these Cuts or

2057
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:38,880
seed lines just to keep making sales

2058
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:41,039
yeah so the lines were discontinued I no

2059
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,600
longer had the cut and I was done but I

2060
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:45,060
felt like I had done everything I could

2061
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:48,060
with blueberry at that point

2062
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:51,060
but so we jump to what I told you about

2063
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:52,860
was when all of my clones got lost with

2064
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,880
the tissue culture person who will

2065
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:55,679
remain nameless because he doesn't

2066
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,640
deserve to be named

2067
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,699
um

2068
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,780
when that happened I lost every clone in

2069
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:04,079
my room

2070
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:05,819
and I was like oh my God I need to I

2071
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:07,859
need to do something new

2072
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:10,559
and I had always had this long affinity

2073
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:12,238
for blueberry and during those years I

2074
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,460
hadn't smoked any and because I sold

2075
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:17,399
every last seed of everything I had of

2076
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:19,560
of my right burial G stuff I was like

2077
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:22,198
hmm

2078
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,000
I wonder and I remember during my

2079
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:26,579
blueberry years on breed Bay there was

2080
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,738
this dude named Lone Star and people

2081
01:17:26,579 --> 01:17:30,840
would talk his blueberry up all the time

2082
01:17:28,738 --> 01:17:33,359
like this is the most blueberry thing

2083
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,819
I've ever had and of course my ego

2084
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:37,079
during those years didn't let me like oh

2085
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:38,519
really let me check out your blueberry

2086
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:40,500
mine was already like [ __ ] your

2087
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,940
blueberry I got the best one right like

2088
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,158
I don't need his [ __ ] you know I need

2089
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:46,079
his [ __ ] for I got the best one they

2090
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:50,158
just don't know right

2091
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:51,719
so when I lost everything I looked in my

2092
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:54,960
seed collection and realized that I had

2093
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:56,579
amassed a massive massive selection of

2094
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,500
all the blueberry lines that I could

2095
01:17:56,579 --> 01:18:00,658
find over the years like I just

2096
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,279
collected slowly and subconsciously was

2097
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:03,599
collecting all these things so I was

2098
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:05,819
looking at my seat stash what should I

2099
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,039
pop and I was like huh I really love

2100
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:10,920
blueberry and I'd like to jump back into

2101
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:12,899
that and um I popped everything that I

2102
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,359
had not every not every seat of

2103
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:17,698
everything but every line right seeds of

2104
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:19,559
every line and a good amount uh I could

2105
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:21,299
name it but it it's just pretty much

2106
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,800
think of every old DJ Short Line you

2107
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,199
could possibly think of in every hybrid

2108
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:29,039
that would like you know the BC hybrids

2109
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:31,859
and whatnot so I went through these and

2110
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,539
I really wasn't finding anything and one

2111
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:36,238
of the lines that I'd been given was

2112
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:38,640
lone Stars Blue Bonnet from Bodie had

2113
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:40,619
kept him over the years

2114
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,640
and in this line there was a female in

2115
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:46,559
it that was just phenomenally blueberry

2116
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,400
phenomenally blueberry and there's this

2117
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,280
male

2118
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:51,960
and I don't usually go by STEM rubs but

2119
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:53,880
he over the years of running blueberry

2120
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:56,819
even for my first experience I learned

2121
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:58,440
selecting with blueberry even in females

2122
01:18:56,819 --> 01:19:00,179
there's a purple stripe that runs down

2123
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:02,460
some of these stocks and there's certain

2124
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:04,219
traits you can look for that will show

2125
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:07,319
you some of the more blueberry terp

2126
01:19:04,219 --> 01:19:08,939
Expressions yeah if you're lucky if

2127
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:12,000
you're lucky it doesn't always denote it

2128
01:19:08,939 --> 01:19:14,039
but it denotes it enough to where it's a

2129
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,658
good place to start right and we all

2130
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:17,640
need a starting point and that was my in

2131
01:19:15,658 --> 01:19:20,099
my mind that was a starting point and

2132
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:22,980
there was this male in the room that

2133
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:26,820
would raise its families

2134
01:19:22,979 --> 01:19:28,559
not like 85 80 degrees from top to

2135
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:30,719
bottom and he was you know he grew

2136
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,760
pretty big he grew fast his family is

2137
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,079
instead when I say praying like some

2138
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,119
people think about the top leaves

2139
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:37,979
praying you know the top little sets

2140
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:41,099
praying when they're happy this was

2141
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:42,959
every family from the bottom angled like

2142
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,980
this like it's raising its [ __ ] hands

2143
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,899
straight up

2144
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:48,000
and I was like wow he has the purple

2145
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:49,920
stripe stalks his stem rub smells

2146
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,439
insanely like blueberry

2147
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,960
I'm gonna give this dude a shot

2148
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:57,059
you know I'm gonna try this and see what

2149
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,760
this male does and so I became more

2150
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:01,199
hyper focused on the the male with my

2151
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,539
females because at this time I had

2152
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:07,559
masked some of my favorite females in my

2153
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:10,679
collection ever right so because of all

2154
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,840
the all the Clones getting wiped out

2155
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:14,158
I had to go back and resource so during

2156
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,840
the time I'm popping all these seeds I'm

2157
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:17,879
also resourcing my whole library from

2158
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,440
people I got it back but there was a

2159
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,300
there's a dude that I haven't named yet

2160
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:23,279
that I absolutely love that I have to

2161
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:25,619
bring in at this point because he helped

2162
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:28,198
me amass my library back

2163
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:31,738
and this is Matt Elite from Elite

2164
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:33,719
cannabis one of my best friends on Earth

2165
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:35,759
um he's one of those dudes that like

2166
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:36,960
really wants to remain nameless in

2167
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,760
cannabis so he's probably gonna be

2168
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,679
annoyed that I even mentioned him you

2169
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,260
know but um

2170
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:47,039
he's a beautiful human being and his

2171
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:49,140
sourcing on cuts and him and um Dave

2172
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:51,899
from Elite cannabis they're sourcing on

2173
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:55,679
Cuts was phenomenal as good as me or CSI

2174
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:58,500
or anyone and he held a lot of the rare

2175
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,760
chems and day Wreckers and stuff and so

2176
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,380
I was able to get day wrecker back

2177
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,239
things that I worked with earlier all

2178
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:04,739
the OG Cuts trying all that [ __ ] I got

2179
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:06,899
back

2180
01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:09,000
um and the cams

2181
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:12,238
and

2182
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,560
um Bodhi Dro came he's like he wrote me

2183
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:14,759
a message and he's like I heard you lost

2184
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,039
your whole Library

2185
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,440
I'll be up in a week that's literally

2186
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:21,300
all he said I'll be up in a week and he

2187
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,339
came up and he dropped off all these

2188
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,380
plants he drove them up to me or drove

2189
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:28,199
them down I should say to me what a

2190
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:31,679
[ __ ] angel I mean like this dude is a

2191
01:21:28,198 --> 01:21:35,219
rock star in our community and

2192
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:39,000
uh just like he is so busy and

2193
01:21:35,219 --> 01:21:40,198
he drove me down clones bro and CSI we

2194
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,698
had one of our meetups for the can

2195
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:43,500
Illuminati which we'll talk about later

2196
01:21:41,698 --> 01:21:46,619
little maybe

2197
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:50,520
um and we we met up and he brought me

2198
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:52,380
clones too like really rare clones so

2199
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,199
during this blueberry work I have a mass

2200
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:56,819
one of my best collections ever just be

2201
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,678
I mean and it was only because the

2202
01:21:56,819 --> 01:22:00,479
community and my friends stepped up and

2203
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:02,760
saw what I'd lost and knew how tragic

2204
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:04,919
that would be for them and gave me those

2205
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,780
so I was like I got a mail

2206
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,420
let's see what he does you know with

2207
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:11,460
this F with this female some of the

2208
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:13,319
other selections from DJ stuff were real

2209
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:15,300
interesting this round including one

2210
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:17,460
from his blueberry line that came from

2211
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:20,100
seeds resin lung had

2212
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:21,658
um from one of the lectures DJ gave in

2213
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,460
California at a collective so he had

2214
01:22:21,658 --> 01:22:25,379
kept these old seeds of flow and this

2215
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:28,140
and I popped those the flow really

2216
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:29,819
didn't do much the um

2217
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:31,440
there was one blueberry that was

2218
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:33,599
semi-blueberry smelling with a little

2219
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:35,639
bit of shitty Backwater but it was blue

2220
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,079
and it looked like every single cut from

2221
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,820
his book that I would have ever wanted

2222
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:40,559
so I had the looks

2223
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:42,960
and I was wondering if this male

2224
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,880
injecting this male into that line would

2225
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,158
pull those blueberry dominant genes out

2226
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,619
further that blueberry scent and we

2227
01:22:47,158 --> 01:22:51,839
would have a line that looked like DJs

2228
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:55,939
but smelled like possibly like the blue

2229
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:59,340
bonnet right so all this was done on

2230
01:22:55,939 --> 01:23:01,979
remembering the stories about lone Stars

2231
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:05,100
the trait of the purple stalks the stem

2232
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:07,500
rub and a wing and a prayer

2233
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,000
so I went into this with that

2234
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,698
had all the clones from my buddies

2235
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,800
reamasked I had the selections from all

2236
01:23:11,698 --> 01:23:15,599
the different blueberries and we did our

2237
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,039
first Bonnet run

2238
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:20,460
and

2239
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:22,619
that mail ended up being so good

2240
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:24,420
it by my perspective

2241
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:27,238
and by a lot of other people to be

2242
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:29,158
honest like and and saying that I I had

2243
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:31,259
very little to do with it like the

2244
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:33,960
selection was pure luck and a little bit

2245
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:36,360
of experience but the work was done by

2246
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,219
Lone Star and Vic High who he got it

2247
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:41,399
from and the blueberries he got from him

2248
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:43,859
and people before him DJ Short even so

2249
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:46,379
when I inherited this line

2250
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:48,000
it did the work and I was just lucky

2251
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:49,920
enough that I paid attention to the

2252
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
traits of him raising his hand even you

2253
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,859
know like it was kind of like I felt

2254
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,439
like the dude spoke to me in a weird

2255
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:56,880
[ __ ] up way yeah

2256
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:58,799
that's how I felt from the jump I

2257
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,900
genuinely felt that pick me was what I

2258
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,380
word for word that's what I thought he

2259
01:24:00,899 --> 01:24:05,219
was saying take me and um it ended up

2260
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:09,239
being

2261
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:11,539
producing the best lines expressions of

2262
01:24:09,238 --> 01:24:14,519
lines that I have ever seen to date

2263
01:24:11,539 --> 01:24:15,539
consistently it consistently puts these

2264
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,940
up

2265
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:20,399
so it became the community is just

2266
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:23,698
reinforcing that yeah yeah right like

2267
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:27,000
and it became this thing where like

2268
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:31,198
I don't know that I ever want to move on

2269
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,840
from it and it it's it's hard because

2270
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:35,759
when you find a male that is true

2271
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,340
breeding cannabis like this and can

2272
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,140
makes consistent stuff that is so rare

2273
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:41,760
because it's so hard to select male

2274
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,560
traits in cannabis because they look

2275
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,940
different from females and their

2276
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:46,560
expressions look different from the same

2277
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:47,879
expression in a female

2278
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,960
that

2279
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:53,579
picking is such a shotgun method

2280
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:55,439
that when you fight it's like you won

2281
01:24:53,579 --> 01:24:57,119
the lottery right it is it is a lottery

2282
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,500
ticket it really is and it doesn't it's

2283
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:00,658
not a lottery ticket in the sense of

2284
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:02,399
this is going to make me money it's a

2285
01:25:00,658 --> 01:25:03,899
genetic lottery ticket in the sense of

2286
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,479
how it breeds

2287
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:09,238
yeah and that to me statistically the

2288
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:11,459
most valuable tool right so I tried to

2289
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:14,879
back him up and not only that the place

2290
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:17,760
that I gave him too I said you can share

2291
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,819
this mail with anyone

2292
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,320
anyone who wants it can use it because I

2293
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:24,238
feel like it's a valuable breeding tool

2294
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:27,359
not just for injecting blueberry into

2295
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:30,059
lines but it has a similar like anxiety

2296
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:32,519
anti-anxiety effect and a similar pain

2297
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:34,620
effect so the original Riot Berry that I

2298
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,840
had found so this this is not just a

2299
01:25:34,619 --> 01:25:39,539
breeding tool it's a medical tool so I

2300
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:42,600
felt like it would be very selfish of me

2301
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:45,600
to sit on this and to not share it so I

2302
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:48,840
gave it to a major Nursery but there it

2303
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,760
contracted hplv and was put to sleep

2304
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:53,159
so the work that exists with that male

2305
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:56,460
exists

2306
01:25:53,158 --> 01:25:57,979
and the mail is gone the mail is gone

2307
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:01,619
unfortunately

2308
01:25:57,979 --> 01:26:05,158
but I do have more seeds of the F1 the

2309
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:07,979
original seeds and I think that

2310
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:09,719
I'm hoping that he pops up enough

2311
01:26:07,979 --> 01:26:12,899
that he will show up again in the amount

2312
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:15,840
of seeds I have the f2s I have the BX

2313
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:17,638
ones and what I've noticed is in these

2314
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,520
lines even in the hybrids whether it's

2315
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:22,859
blooper skunk blue resin Kush any of

2316
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,300
them there is a male and in The Punchy

2317
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:25,799
booster as well which is how we selected

2318
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:29,100
The Punchy blue stir stuff for our

2319
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:31,079
newest work the all the males do this

2320
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:33,659
and every single one of those males

2321
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:36,238
breeds blue traits and blue turps so it

2322
01:26:33,658 --> 01:26:37,259
is looking like it's a link trait to at

2323
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:39,959
least

2324
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:42,600
it may the blueberry chirps come through

2325
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,819
even when that trait doesn't show up but

2326
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,900
it for sure shows up when I see that

2327
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:48,059
trait

2328
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:49,819
and it reads true when I see that trait

2329
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:52,620
so you've got like a strong

2330
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:54,779
correspondence yeah yeah correlation and

2331
01:26:52,619 --> 01:26:58,219
yeah causation and correlation type

2332
01:26:54,779 --> 01:27:01,019
thing yeah and it seems to be true

2333
01:26:58,219 --> 01:27:03,000
across all lines which means it's true

2334
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:06,360
breeding across all lines and that's

2335
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,100
special so I'm not as upset as I was

2336
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:09,299
about losing the mail because I really

2337
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:11,820
think you can go through any of these

2338
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,619
hybrids and select that trait and find

2339
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:16,198
something that will breed just as

2340
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:17,698
similar as the male did for those Terps

2341
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:20,460
maybe not look

2342
01:27:17,698 --> 01:27:22,259
but Terps effect and potency and all

2343
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:24,060
that and that's the other thing that the

2344
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:27,480
blue bonnet line had that mine never did

2345
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:31,320
was it extreme recreational potency

2346
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:33,299
um one of the cuts yesterday or yeah

2347
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:35,579
someone had the blooper skunk tested

2348
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:39,079
yesterday now diesel does not test hide

2349
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:42,658
ever it's like 15 16

2350
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:44,460
consistently in from places that are

2351
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:47,039
more reliable for testing and consistent

2352
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,960
with their testing so he hit me back and

2353
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:52,738
he's like this Line's testing at 27. so

2354
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,300
thank you whoa and I'm like wow a

2355
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:56,759
blueberry that injects that kind of

2356
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:58,199
potency and everything is so phenomenal

2357
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:00,420
I mean we're getting results back on the

2358
01:27:58,198 --> 01:28:03,238
blue resin Kush that it has you know 7.5

2359
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:06,420
percent total Terps five percent mercine

2360
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:09,479
5.5 percent mercine in the in that one

2361
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:12,899
and uh summer 3.5 Mercedes number five

2362
01:28:09,479 --> 01:28:14,819
percent mercine in small pops like six

2363
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:18,119
seed pops

2364
01:28:14,819 --> 01:28:21,539
so yeah it's breathing true for a lot of

2365
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:24,719
wild extreme traits so it's all it's

2366
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:27,119
almost like even if I wanted to move on

2367
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:30,719
because I feel so strong about its

2368
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:34,380
potency it's medical relevance

2369
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:36,179
I find it very hard to move on I feel a

2370
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:37,319
responsibility with it even if people

2371
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:40,500
don't care

2372
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:42,179
even if it never makes me any money

2373
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,920
you know because trying to resell

2374
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:45,600
blueberry like I've talked about is hard

2375
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,000
people have had experiences with DJ

2376
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,139
shorts positive or negative so if it's

2377
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
positive they're like I've already found

2378
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:52,440
a good one if it's negative I've already

2379
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,479
run blueberry why would I want to run

2380
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:57,238
one that shit's boof you know that's a

2381
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:58,979
lot of the attitude I get so it and it's

2382
01:28:57,238 --> 01:29:01,678
it's I respect it because I had that

2383
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:04,799
same attitude for a long time

2384
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:07,380
I think I do want to ask you about you

2385
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,880
know what the future holds but this is

2386
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:11,400
also a good time for me to ask one of

2387
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,920
the questions I got from one of our uh

2388
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:17,039
Syndicate members absolutely and it's a

2389
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,179
hard question go ahead it's from J I

2390
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:22,738
don't I've never known how to say this

2391
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:26,460
guy's name jebs ziggs yeah yeah

2392
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:28,500
okay Jabs exhausts if you have one

2393
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:32,279
what's your favorite expression or plant

2394
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:35,158
tip ever popped out of the bar Network

2395
01:29:32,279 --> 01:29:36,960
um so I have to say my maybe it's part

2396
01:29:35,158 --> 01:29:40,198
two or top three I'll give you a topic

2397
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,420
I'll give you a top three

2398
01:29:40,198 --> 01:29:43,138
all for different reasons

2399
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,179
um

2400
01:29:43,139 --> 01:29:46,619
the silver Pearl Blue Bonnet which we

2401
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:48,719
called the cream

2402
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:50,880
one because it lets the silver Pearl

2403
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:54,480
come through so well with all of the

2404
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:56,279
other Bonnet traits except for the berry

2405
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:58,500
um my favorite expressions in that line

2406
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:01,738
are the strictly silver Pearl traits

2407
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:04,439
with Bonnet potency and Bonnet type High

2408
01:30:01,738 --> 01:30:06,319
which is pretty close to the the silver

2409
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:10,259
Pearl type height real quality

2410
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:11,939
anti-anxiety not a ton of um cerebral

2411
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:15,000
like the dumb mouth stuff that I talk

2412
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:16,559
about but um everything else so that's

2413
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,020
one of them because I love the smell of

2414
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,480
silver Pearl it's one of my favorites

2415
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:23,520
um a second one would be Punchy blister

2416
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:26,099
and that's because I've always really

2417
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:29,040
enjoyed the great combination with

2418
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:32,159
blueberry uh like the blueberry jam when

2419
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:34,260
you tape like a picture taking grape

2420
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:37,799
um jam and combining it with blueberry

2421
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:40,639
jam and smelling it like Smuckers like

2422
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:44,400
insane insane

2423
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:46,020
mouth-watering delicious smell and grape

2424
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:47,579
amplifies the blueberry and blueberry

2425
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:49,860
amplifies the grape

2426
01:30:47,579 --> 01:30:53,100
so that's one of those ones that is just

2427
01:30:49,859 --> 01:30:55,259
so extreme and it's so loud

2428
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:57,960
um across the board when you have a room

2429
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:59,699
full of popped Punchy booster seeds it's

2430
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,219
mostly all you're smelling in a room

2431
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:03,899
even if you have like other strong cams

2432
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:06,060
rog's in there that are putting off dank

2433
01:31:03,899 --> 01:31:09,359
smells this stuff's so loud great

2434
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:12,300
blueberry with no skunky smells that is

2435
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:14,399
just wild wild wow yeah it would cut

2436
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:17,100
through it cuts through yeah it's crazy

2437
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:19,920
so that's one for that reason and I love

2438
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:22,079
the smell and taste and the potency is

2439
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,779
screaming you know it's way up there it

2440
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:27,300
has THC percents that everybody loves

2441
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:29,460
and the third

2442
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:32,639
out of the hybrids would be the blue

2443
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:34,800
resin Kush because after seeing the test

2444
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:37,380
results of the amount of nursing which

2445
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:41,960
is a is something we know has as major

2446
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:44,819
medical effects and the THC percentage

2447
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:46,380
uh with the extracts I know it's going

2448
01:31:44,819 --> 01:31:49,019
to be probably one of the most medically

2449
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:51,659
relevant plants that I've ever ever had

2450
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:53,699
the pleasure of releasing

2451
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:55,500
and because it was a project between me

2452
01:31:53,698 --> 01:31:58,979
and my boy resin long who I love a lot

2453
01:31:55,500 --> 01:32:01,800
that's my boy so yeah it's a few few

2454
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:03,599
levels of of love for that and the

2455
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,960
medical part I really do think it's

2456
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,880
going to be the most medically

2457
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:10,679
important plant that I've ever touched

2458
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,940
and I don't know if that means that it

2459
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:14,100
will be in the future and like people

2460
01:32:11,939 --> 01:32:17,698
will take hold of it I just know that

2461
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:19,940
the potential is there for it to be that

2462
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,939
foreign

2463
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:25,319
well I had a few questions to kind of

2464
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,360
round out this uh section on your

2465
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:30,119
breeding work okay

2466
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:32,039
um and I guess these are these are more

2467
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:33,238
like narrow questions or more focused

2468
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:35,880
questions okay

2469
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:37,799
uh first one I have is what were some

2470
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:40,319
notable you know quote unquote failures

2471
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,960
or quote unquote dead ends

2472
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:45,599
um in in some of your work

2473
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,698
so um the first one was a lot of people

2474
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,739
don't know this but like I did Auto

2475
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:52,379
flower breeding feminized Auto flower

2476
01:32:49,738 --> 01:32:54,359
breeding really early I had no idea yeah

2477
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:57,659
one of my main

2478
01:32:54,359 --> 01:33:00,539
um mentors in feminized seeds who taught

2479
01:32:57,658 --> 01:33:02,158
me well there's a few Shanti Baba was

2480
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:04,738
one you taught me how to make Femme

2481
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:06,539
seeds and he was resistant to it he did

2482
01:33:04,738 --> 01:33:08,039
not like them at the time and he let me

2483
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:11,639
know that but he was also willing to

2484
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:13,319
teach me which was Unreal like do you

2485
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:16,020
have one of the best breeders on Earth

2486
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:18,840
teaching you that was phenomenal

2487
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:21,239
um also Ernesto from Buddha seed Spain

2488
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:22,739
who most people don't know his name or

2489
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:25,500
his company they think of big Buddha

2490
01:33:22,738 --> 01:33:27,658
seeds Milo but Buddha seeds it was from

2491
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,800
Spain and a lot of people don't know

2492
01:33:27,658 --> 01:33:30,000
they are one of the biggest sea

2493
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,619
companies on Earth

2494
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,139
um but it's not because their Autoflower

2495
01:33:31,619 --> 01:33:35,340
work they are one of the resellers of

2496
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:36,719
seeds meaning they're not resellers

2497
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:40,260
they're one of the major retailers of

2498
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:41,340
seeds in Spain bulk retailers

2499
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:43,320
um

2500
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:46,500
the only competition they had for a long

2501
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:48,059
time was like a dynafim

2502
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:50,399
um mimota but they were one of the first

2503
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:52,139
doing it before that and they were

2504
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:53,279
retelling like Greenhouse or vonas

2505
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:54,300
anytime you're buying greenhouse seeds

2506
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:56,399
you're actually buying seeds from

2507
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:58,199
Ernesto during those eras or Nirvana or

2508
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:59,579
any of those places

2509
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:01,319
um and he taught me how to make femini

2510
01:33:59,579 --> 01:34:02,760
seeds and he taught me how he was doing

2511
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:05,939
it and how he was breeding for auto

2512
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,619
trades so I started with his work called

2513
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:11,579
white dwarf

2514
01:34:07,619 --> 01:34:13,260
and it was a white widow crossed to I

2515
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:15,420
believe a low rider number two is what

2516
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:18,239
he chose or maybe is low rider number

2517
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:21,719
one and he bred that in and made a very

2518
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:24,959
what we considered potent Autoflower and

2519
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:27,779
so I brought this to America I feminized

2520
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:32,939
I reversed some of his Autoflower

2521
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:35,880
uh females and we made uh

2522
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:37,379
um what do we buy it with

2523
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,179
there I think we combined it with low

2524
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,619
rider one ourselves if I remember

2525
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:42,899
correctly that was what we popped it was

2526
01:34:40,619 --> 01:34:44,939
low rider one or two ourselves to make

2527
01:34:42,899 --> 01:34:47,759
our line

2528
01:34:44,939 --> 01:34:50,219
uh White writer I believe we called it

2529
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,500
which I hate the name now

2530
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:54,179
it's a name it's like sounds nazi-ish or

2531
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,520
something like white rice it really does

2532
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:57,899
and that's the name of a Nazi album like

2533
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,460
punk rock album that I didn't even know

2534
01:34:57,899 --> 01:35:03,238
about so like

2535
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:05,460
yeah it's not my favorite anyways so it

2536
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:07,439
was a great line for an auto line but

2537
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:09,779
with this at the same time I was also

2538
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:12,658
popping white or purple Widow from Des

2539
01:35:09,779 --> 01:35:14,579
Shaman seeds this is ingamar De Shaman's

2540
01:35:12,658 --> 01:35:17,579
company who made white widow so I

2541
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:19,619
thought like for sure I was gonna get

2542
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:24,840
the best purple Widow ever

2543
01:35:19,619 --> 01:35:29,099
what I got was an auto flowering perm

2544
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:31,139
that was totally purple from birth

2545
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:32,579
but because it was totally purple like

2546
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:34,079
from the jump and it wasn't like

2547
01:35:32,579 --> 01:35:36,238
environmentally purple and it didn't

2548
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:38,579
turn purple later on which is what most

2549
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,919
purples were would turn purple later on

2550
01:35:38,579 --> 01:35:43,139
it was a true breeding purple I tried

2551
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:45,420
breeding it into the

2552
01:35:43,139 --> 01:35:47,340
white Rider because it already had the

2553
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:49,920
Autoflower trait which wasn't advertised

2554
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:50,940
on the package ever

2555
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,980
um

2556
01:35:50,939 --> 01:35:55,500
because it had that I wanted to see if I

2557
01:35:52,979 --> 01:35:57,178
could outcross the or like

2558
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,619
in Cross that without bringing in the

2559
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:02,760
hermit trait

2560
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:05,519
and I had the line purple writer

2561
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:07,980
and it was all her rooms

2562
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,659
it was all herbs it's [ __ ] all

2563
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:11,218
autoflowering but it's all Herms and I

2564
01:36:09,658 --> 01:36:15,059
took it to F3 and released it like

2565
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:18,600
wasted time on this [ __ ] and um yeah so

2566
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:22,679
that was that was my worst line without

2567
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:25,260
any doubts I made an auto flowering

2568
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:27,060
true reading harm without any doubts

2569
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,920
that was the worst line but there's

2570
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:30,900
other lines like I have a green crack

2571
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:35,279
bx1 that I made using the Platinum

2572
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:38,399
banana OG the X1 is the outcross and

2573
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:40,559
um with green crack crossed in twice and

2574
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:44,819
it was so far away from Green Crack by

2575
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:47,100
the bx1 that I just stopped

2576
01:36:44,819 --> 01:36:49,859
and just cut the line killed it

2577
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:52,020
I gave it out to friends

2578
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:53,759
um but yeah it just didn't release it

2579
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:58,139
because it was so bad

2580
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,579
it wasn't bad it was a great line but

2581
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:01,560
like people would have liked it it was

2582
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:03,300
Platinum banana OG though like it was

2583
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,440
not green crack so the name was a total

2584
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,300
misnomer I probably could have changed

2585
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:08,879
the name and sold it

2586
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:10,739
but I was so mad that it was so far away

2587
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,779
from where I wanted it to be that I was

2588
01:37:10,738 --> 01:37:15,718
just like screw it

2589
01:37:12,779 --> 01:37:17,399
bird seed gave it to the bird you know

2590
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:19,380
I've realistically like I found some of

2591
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:20,460
the packs left but Chacha got a lot of

2592
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:21,960
them

2593
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:24,060
um

2594
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:26,279
there are so many times like that though

2595
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:28,500
a lot of times it was the BX ones

2596
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:30,300
because interesting I would try to make

2597
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:32,579
a bx1 line

2598
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:33,840
and not go bx2 or bx3 because to me

2599
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:34,920
there's no point in taking stuff that

2600
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,539
far you should be able to take it to be

2601
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:38,699
X1 lock in a single trait and that said

2602
01:37:36,539 --> 01:37:40,920
if you do it correctly and have a male

2603
01:37:38,698 --> 01:37:42,479
breeding line and I always wanted to

2604
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:45,060
make a male breeding line

2605
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:46,919
as opposed to the s1s during a long

2606
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,539
period because it just got so much [ __ ]

2607
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,859
for feminine seeds and everybody [ __ ]

2608
01:37:48,539 --> 01:37:51,539
hated me it was locking me out of cuts

2609
01:37:49,859 --> 01:37:54,539
because I was making Femme seeds so I

2610
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:57,060
started doing the bx1 thing you know

2611
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:58,800
well that's a good segue because

2612
01:37:57,060 --> 01:38:01,920
the next question is actually from

2613
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:04,079
Shawnee yeah and it is on it is about

2614
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:06,239
Femmes it is about reversals because as

2615
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:07,859
you've alluded to you know that it was

2616
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:10,019
quite a controversial thing for you to

2617
01:38:07,859 --> 01:38:11,399
be doing at the time yeah so the

2618
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:13,500
question I guess from Shawnee is kind of

2619
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:16,439
like taking a slightly different stance

2620
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:17,639
and it's like looking back from where we

2621
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:20,399
are now

2622
01:38:17,639 --> 01:38:22,859
how did reversals eventually become the

2623
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:24,658
norm and if you could go back you know

2624
01:38:22,859 --> 01:38:26,759
how would you explain to someone that

2625
01:38:24,658 --> 01:38:30,179
had that you know more conservative

2626
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:34,579
mentality of why reversals are useful

2627
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:34,579
wow okay so how did it become the norm

2628
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:39,000
you know I think because I know one

2629
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,560
thing about this is that I know that

2630
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,179
there are a couple of myths that float

2631
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,840
around that kind of like trigger slash

2632
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:47,340
signal you right yeah so at the

2633
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,400
beginning I I guess I got to talk about

2634
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:52,679
the beginning and the myths to start

2635
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:54,779
this so at the beginning there was a

2636
01:38:52,679 --> 01:38:57,359
myth that femini seeds because it's

2637
01:38:54,779 --> 01:39:00,960
missing a male chromosome would ruin

2638
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:01,679
cannabis The genome the genetics as a

2639
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,560
whole

2640
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:07,079
like that was a real concern like that I

2641
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:09,300
was doing GMO work

2642
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:12,300
and that I was going to ruin cannabis

2643
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,920
because of feminized seeds

2644
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:16,440
um Americans tended to have this

2645
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:19,079
attitude the Dutch had I didn't notice

2646
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:21,299
this attitude over there except with a

2647
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:22,500
few companies like Mr Nice and stuff and

2648
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,820
he wouldn't be considered Dutch because

2649
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,560
by this time he'd moved to Switzerland

2650
01:39:23,819 --> 01:39:27,479
but he wasn't you know Amsterdam for a

2651
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,340
long time he carried the attitude of

2652
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:31,439
that

2653
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:32,639
um a lot of people also carry this weird

2654
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:35,339
I don't want to say I shouldn't say

2655
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:39,900
weird this very religious Christian

2656
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:43,380
mindset that if God God didn't feminize

2657
01:39:39,899 --> 01:39:46,138
seeds therefore it's unnatural breeding

2658
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:47,760
and I want nothing to do with it

2659
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:50,100
God doesn't come into play when they say

2660
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,260
that they just say this is unnatural and

2661
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:54,120
I want nothing to do with it this is not

2662
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:57,060
organic

2663
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:59,340
and I don't want anything to do with it

2664
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:01,320
um so those were the two main mindsets

2665
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:02,940
that were going around I can't think of

2666
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:05,939
many others

2667
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:07,259
um fans oh all fans Herm that was the

2668
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:09,539
other one right like because of my

2669
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:11,880
experience with shamans

2670
01:40:09,539 --> 01:40:13,079
yeah which a lot of people had that

2671
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,699
experience they were buying from

2672
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:16,139
Amsterdam and they were popping

2673
01:40:14,698 --> 01:40:18,658
feminized seeds and they were getting

2674
01:40:16,139 --> 01:40:19,980
Herms but the what they didn't really

2675
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:21,539
take into account was that they were

2676
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:23,279
popping regular seats and getting Herms

2677
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:26,039
too at the same rate

2678
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:28,920
from Amsterdam and it was just wasn't

2679
01:40:26,039 --> 01:40:30,960
specific to films yeah but the myth was

2680
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,219
set anyways because it was like oh fems

2681
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,859
are new

2682
01:40:32,219 --> 01:40:36,840
I'm getting Herms

2683
01:40:34,859 --> 01:40:40,920
Benz cost more so I bought Femmes

2684
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:42,239
expecting better this sucks right [ __ ]

2685
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,920
these things

2686
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:45,539
and

2687
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:48,119
it was a lot of that

2688
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:50,340
basically

2689
01:40:48,119 --> 01:40:52,260
my main argument to like the god

2690
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:55,039
Community or the organic Community was

2691
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:58,860
that in nature

2692
01:40:55,039 --> 01:41:00,119
cannabis is an intersex plant that's

2693
01:40:58,859 --> 01:41:02,759
right

2694
01:41:00,119 --> 01:41:05,460
and it wants to be intersex and only

2695
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:08,039
because of humans human intervention and

2696
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:11,158
breeding we have pushed this plant to

2697
01:41:08,039 --> 01:41:13,260
try to choose between male or female

2698
01:41:11,158 --> 01:41:15,839
that's not natural

2699
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:16,860
to push it and to make it and to breed

2700
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,619
it towards that direction that was only

2701
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:23,238
done by man in man's intervention so

2702
01:41:19,619 --> 01:41:26,460
using their mindset technically we are

2703
01:41:23,238 --> 01:41:30,379
restoring cannabis back to where it was

2704
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:30,380
as an intersex plant

2705
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:37,379
onto the missing chromosomes destroying

2706
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,340
cannabis

2707
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,279
foreign

2708
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:44,219
all it takes is Crossing in a male to a

2709
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:47,460
feminized plant

2710
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:49,319
you're back to regular

2711
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:51,359
yeah

2712
01:41:49,319 --> 01:41:53,759
um there are and also like there are

2713
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:55,380
things called autosomes that control uh

2714
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,320
that are not that are not the sexual

2715
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:00,000
chromosomes of the x's and y's that also

2716
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:02,340
control sexual expression in cannabis

2717
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,420
and trying to explain that to people is

2718
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:05,159
really hard because they don't even

2719
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:07,500
understand chromosomes and autosomes in

2720
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:09,839
the first place but it contr it just

2721
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:11,158
shits all over that argument because

2722
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,739
there's already autosomes controlling

2723
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:15,719
this which is why in feminine seeds you

2724
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:18,899
can have a pran a plant that expresses

2725
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:21,600
fully male with no female traits or I'm

2726
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:23,399
sorry yeah fully male no female traits

2727
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,980
send it in to be tested and it'll test

2728
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:28,379
all female because that's how cannabis

2729
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:30,000
is it can express amazing yeah it can

2730
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:31,560
express all female without any female

2731
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,840
corrosis chromosomes because the

2732
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:35,520
autosomes are telling hey we need we

2733
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,159
need uh balls here

2734
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,179
so that's an issue that people don't

2735
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:40,859
take into account because they don't

2736
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:43,739
it's it's way beyond their

2737
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:45,359
comprehensions level of cannabis right

2738
01:42:43,738 --> 01:42:48,000
yeah um

2739
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:50,158
all fems harm we kind of this it's

2740
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,719
really [ __ ] in [ __ ] out which a lot of

2741
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:53,759
people do understand you put in [ __ ]

2742
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:56,698
you're gonna get out [ __ ] so if you have

2743
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:59,760
two plants that are uh naturally

2744
01:42:56,698 --> 01:43:02,219
intersex and want to remain intersex and

2745
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:05,340
you feminize one or you feminize that

2746
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:07,800
plant and pollinate itself like the

2747
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:09,239
likelihood is that its progeny will have

2748
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:12,920
those same traits

2749
01:43:09,238 --> 01:43:15,539
yeah and it's not because it's feminized

2750
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:18,239
meanings yeah yeah and and actually

2751
01:43:15,539 --> 01:43:21,600
because it's feminized it actually takes

2752
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:23,519
it two generations or like it not to

2753
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,260
generate it takes it what would be

2754
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,699
several generations of regular

2755
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:29,159
inbreeding

2756
01:43:26,698 --> 01:43:30,599
further in and so you're getting more of

2757
01:43:29,158 --> 01:43:33,238
the recessive traits including the

2758
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:37,440
intersex traits so technically because

2759
01:43:33,238 --> 01:43:39,479
it was [ __ ] it amplifies the [ __ ]

2760
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:41,099
but if it wasn't [ __ ] it wouldn't be

2761
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:43,079
Amplified if that makes sense so fem

2762
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:46,139
seeds no it doesn't contribute to more

2763
01:43:43,079 --> 01:43:48,779
of the Herms but because it was [ __ ] you

2764
01:43:46,139 --> 01:43:50,699
were always going to get the herbs

2765
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:55,500
totally so yeah so it's it's a weird

2766
01:43:50,698 --> 01:43:57,539
kind of like self-defeetist type model

2767
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:59,279
yeah like it's it's you're set up to

2768
01:43:57,539 --> 01:44:00,899
fail in the first place by what they

2769
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:02,399
chose and the BR and the genetics you

2770
01:44:00,899 --> 01:44:05,279
wanted anyways

2771
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:07,559
um how it became popular I really just

2772
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:10,019
think that it was over the years of me

2773
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:12,659
selling Femme spray

2774
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:14,880
um people started their attitudes

2775
01:44:12,658 --> 01:44:17,579
changed it was funny I noticed the big

2776
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:21,118
change was when breeders that were [ __ ]

2777
01:44:17,579 --> 01:44:22,920
talking feminized seeds majorly started

2778
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:25,559
buying the Femme spray off me behind the

2779
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,779
scenes and started doing it and started

2780
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:29,039
playing with it and realized oh it

2781
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:30,658
wasn't that hard

2782
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:32,399
I can make Femme seeds and I could

2783
01:44:30,658 --> 01:44:35,158
charge more for this these things are

2784
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:37,099
these things are fire you know and then

2785
01:44:35,158 --> 01:44:40,138
there were breeders like Canada

2786
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:42,000
who didn't buy my spray but saw the

2787
01:44:40,139 --> 01:44:44,699
advantages of it and he was a well-known

2788
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:48,359
figure who was really well liked and in

2789
01:44:44,698 --> 01:44:50,039
in the community already and so by him

2790
01:44:48,359 --> 01:44:52,380
doing feminized seeds

2791
01:44:50,039 --> 01:44:54,238
it's kind of okay CSI popped up he's

2792
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:56,579
super respective he popped back up I

2793
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:59,039
should say and he was releasing femini

2794
01:44:56,579 --> 01:45:00,118
seeds now too he's respected so that's

2795
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:02,039
okay

2796
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:03,359
you know OG Rascal never caught any

2797
01:45:02,039 --> 01:45:05,100
Flack really for it that I remember

2798
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:08,279
because he was scary

2799
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:10,260
and intimidating so you know it just

2800
01:45:08,279 --> 01:45:12,300
slowly the attitude changed to where

2801
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:14,639
they weren't people that you could [ __ ]

2802
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:16,739
talk they can Femme seeds

2803
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,239
and more people were buying the spray

2804
01:45:16,738 --> 01:45:20,339
and doing it behind the scenes and

2805
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:22,559
realizing I can do this

2806
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:24,840
you know if I don't have to mix these

2807
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:27,420
chemicals and do all this hard [ __ ] I

2808
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:29,639
can do this you know yeah I mean you you

2809
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:31,980
basically provided a platform yeah

2810
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:34,199
people to actually start doing it

2811
01:45:31,979 --> 01:45:35,638
um and it's a funny thing you know I

2812
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:37,738
think about that product of yours and

2813
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:39,719
the the thing about it is that it's

2814
01:45:37,738 --> 01:45:41,039
almost too good like once someone has a

2815
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:42,179
bottle of that stuff I bet you they

2816
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:45,238
don't really have to come back to you

2817
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:47,100
for years yeah that's that that became

2818
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:48,539
an issue like I'm creating competitors

2819
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:51,719
too in the market

2820
01:45:48,539 --> 01:45:54,539
but yeah yeah I think and that also

2821
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:57,300
became an issue of contention for a lot

2822
01:45:54,539 --> 01:46:00,719
of the [ __ ] [ __ ] talk after the fact

2823
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:03,600
right one of my main people that hates

2824
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:06,480
my guts and [ __ ] talks me everywhere

2825
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:09,659
hates me on the premise that I created

2826
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:11,879
competitors for him I he said you are

2827
01:46:09,658 --> 01:46:14,879
arming the enemy

2828
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:18,840
literally word for word

2829
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:20,159
so yeah um it's yeah it's I didn't look

2830
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,779
at it that way

2831
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:23,158
no and I mean that's the thing right

2832
01:46:21,779 --> 01:46:25,679
like you're playing a different game

2833
01:46:23,158 --> 01:46:28,079
like for a lot for these people it's

2834
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:30,359
like a zero-sum game right whereas for

2835
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:32,819
you you you're just thinking about how

2836
01:46:30,359 --> 01:46:34,139
to better equip the community yes I'm

2837
01:46:32,819 --> 01:46:36,420
thinking we're on a Level Playing Field

2838
01:46:34,139 --> 01:46:38,760
and if they do this for these clones

2839
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:41,100
that they have maybe they're clones that

2840
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:42,780
I don't have and I can get those s1s and

2841
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:44,100
I can look to that line finally because

2842
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:47,399
they use my spray and they did it right

2843
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:49,739
like that's my mindset it's gonna be

2844
01:46:47,399 --> 01:46:51,719
more dank out there for all of us

2845
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:53,759
yeah and and another charitable

2846
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:55,139
paraphrase of that is that like you

2847
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:57,239
thought it would be mutually beneficial

2848
01:46:55,139 --> 01:47:00,179
it is me yeah for sure it's mutually

2849
01:46:57,238 --> 01:47:02,698
beneficial absolutely and like groups

2850
01:47:00,179 --> 01:47:04,319
The Way Way groups work and the way they

2851
01:47:02,698 --> 01:47:05,879
Thrive best is when everything's

2852
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:07,259
mutually beneficial because everybody's

2853
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:09,118
working for each other and it doesn't

2854
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:11,039
have to be a one-to-one type thing like

2855
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:13,319
people think all the time sometimes

2856
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:15,779
mutually beneficial means

2857
01:47:13,319 --> 01:47:18,118
100 people buy that sprayer I give away

2858
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:20,939
100 bottles of that spray which is also

2859
01:47:18,118 --> 01:47:22,979
the case to other breeders and I say

2860
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:24,479
you know like you know if you like it if

2861
01:47:22,979 --> 01:47:26,399
it works for you just drop me a little

2862
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:28,979
ad or like say you liked it make a post

2863
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:31,679
with it so you loved it and you get to

2864
01:47:28,979 --> 01:47:32,579
see very quickly how many people respect

2865
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:35,219
that

2866
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:36,840
or don't so you it's there's all kinds

2867
01:47:35,219 --> 01:47:38,219
of things that are usually been like it

2868
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:40,260
was mutually beneficial for me to see

2869
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:41,819
that they weren't good people or that

2870
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:43,020
they didn't respect me like I'd hoped so

2871
01:47:41,819 --> 01:47:44,698
that's mutually beneficial for even

2872
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:49,260
though it cost me money

2873
01:47:44,698 --> 01:47:51,719
it wasn't so much that I lost

2874
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,400
the the outwing of losing that money for

2875
01:47:51,719 --> 01:47:55,319
shipping and stuff

2876
01:47:53,399 --> 01:47:56,638
it was worth it to see that this

2877
01:47:55,319 --> 01:47:59,158
particular person isn't worth doing

2878
01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:01,199
business with in the future right yeah

2879
01:47:59,158 --> 01:48:03,719
so there's that Mutual beneficial too

2880
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:04,618
like benefits come in losses oddly

2881
01:48:03,719 --> 01:48:07,500
enough

2882
01:48:04,618 --> 01:48:09,779
yeah for sure even because

2883
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:11,819
information is still a benefit right

2884
01:48:09,779 --> 01:48:13,439
data all data is a benefit to me if

2885
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:15,238
you're a nerd if you're a nerd and you

2886
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:17,819
pay attention to [ __ ] all data is a

2887
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:21,079
benefit even bad data even erroneous

2888
01:48:17,819 --> 01:48:21,079
data it's still data

2889
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,679
no very cool no that that was a great

2890
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,659
great response and a great question from

2891
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:30,060
Shawnee as well yeah I'm glad that he uh

2892
01:48:27,658 --> 01:48:32,638
he got that in there

2893
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:35,400
um so okay zooming out uh a little bit

2894
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:36,840
more and just thinking now about this is

2895
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:38,279
the last question for the breeding work

2896
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:40,380
section sure

2897
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:42,238
the future and I know probably again

2898
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:44,159
quite a hard and like very open question

2899
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:46,919
but you know what what do you think the

2900
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:49,500
future holds for your breeding work

2901
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:53,158
right now because I'm so focused on The

2902
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:57,179
Syndicate uh be it this podcast be it

2903
01:48:53,158 --> 01:49:01,500
the Discord the patreon Discord or

2904
01:48:57,179 --> 01:49:03,539
or a close friend group

2905
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:07,319
I've been focusing more on that in

2906
01:49:03,539 --> 01:49:08,579
community building than I have on plans

2907
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:09,840
because it takes a lot I mean

2908
01:49:08,579 --> 01:49:12,179
realistically it takes a lot of time

2909
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:14,340
like people don't know how much is

2910
01:49:12,179 --> 01:49:16,920
behind the scenes stuff goes on but like

2911
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:20,880
it isn't even just me like guys like

2912
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:23,639
thousand Shawnee cry baby not so we are

2913
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,440
working on this [ __ ] all way more than

2914
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:29,760
we probably should that's healthy right

2915
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:32,460
so so like breeding for the future a lot

2916
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:35,039
of it is going to be collaborative stuff

2917
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:38,399
because I feel like

2918
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:40,198
this was built to not only just

2919
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:41,819
I didn't want to ever prop myself up

2920
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:43,379
with this [ __ ] because that just looks

2921
01:49:41,819 --> 01:49:44,939
like a used car salesman that's why like

2922
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:47,719
I was so hesitant to do the episode in

2923
01:49:44,939 --> 01:49:51,359
the first place but to prop up friends

2924
01:49:47,719 --> 01:49:54,060
who maybe are way better than me what

2925
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:56,158
they do or at least I feel that way and

2926
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:57,300
haven't gotten the shine because they're

2927
01:49:56,158 --> 01:49:59,099
quiet

2928
01:49:57,300 --> 01:50:00,300
or because they don't want to deal with

2929
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:02,219
sales they don't want to deal with the

2930
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:04,320
drama of sales because drama comes with

2931
01:50:02,219 --> 01:50:06,840
sales and having a seed company every

2932
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:09,118
time people start hating you

2933
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:10,980
um they don't want to deal with that so

2934
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:13,618
in doing this I spent a lot of time on

2935
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:15,599
that and my future like I have the

2936
01:50:13,618 --> 01:50:17,460
projects collaborations with CSI there

2937
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:19,260
can be a lot of those

2938
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:21,359
um there's going to be a big one coming

2939
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:23,820
with knots of dogs CSI and The Syndicate

2940
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:25,559
that I'm going to help with

2941
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:26,880
um that one's gonna be big like people

2942
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,380
have been waiting for not so release

2943
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:31,500
this is the feminized not so release

2944
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:33,900
coming and it's coming soon very soon so

2945
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,738
you know I'm stoked on that one

2946
01:50:33,899 --> 01:50:37,799
um

2947
01:50:34,738 --> 01:50:40,079
we have I mean The Punchy project I just

2948
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:42,420
did here locally I'm getting to teach

2949
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:43,920
someone as I you know teach someone the

2950
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,600
the blue bonnet traits that come through

2951
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,460
in The Punchy stuff and like getting to

2952
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:50,880
teach on hand which I I've always been

2953
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:52,980
the student like it's fun you know

2954
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:55,139
um I think that that does sum up in a

2955
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:56,939
way like uh what you're just saying

2956
01:50:55,139 --> 01:50:59,880
right like you were kind of leaning now

2957
01:50:56,939 --> 01:51:02,339
towards other people and kind of like

2958
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:04,859
um equipping other people yeah and I

2959
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:07,319
mean like I realized like

2960
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:09,359
this is my livelihood too

2961
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:11,519
as a seed company it's always it's it's

2962
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:12,899
been my livelihood and I'm pretty open

2963
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:15,900
about that like making money off

2964
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:17,698
cannabis some people denounce and decry

2965
01:51:15,899 --> 01:51:20,698
it but like I really feel like if you're

2966
01:51:17,698 --> 01:51:23,158
good to it in the plant and advancing it

2967
01:51:20,698 --> 01:51:26,219
like there's not there's not a lot of

2968
01:51:23,158 --> 01:51:26,879
disrespect going on there you know

2969
01:51:26,219 --> 01:51:30,840
um

2970
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:33,239
but I also feel like in doing so we owe

2971
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:36,000
it to build the community forward and

2972
01:51:33,238 --> 01:51:39,178
saying that is one thing the actions are

2973
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,039
way [ __ ] bigger and I watched and

2974
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:42,480
waited and waited and I've never felt

2975
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:44,100
like I'm the right person to do this for

2976
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:46,019
many reasons and we haven't gotten to it

2977
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:47,940
it's already like far in on the

2978
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:51,239
controversies but like

2979
01:51:47,939 --> 01:51:52,500
we're gonna head there next so okay I

2980
01:51:51,238 --> 01:51:53,879
mean this is a good way to segue then

2981
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:55,500
like

2982
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:58,139
I don't I didn't even know if I was the

2983
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:59,340
right person to do this but no one was

2984
01:51:58,139 --> 01:52:01,800
doing it

2985
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:05,279
and if they were they were doing it

2986
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:08,880
I feel were selfish agendas

2987
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:10,679
yeah and even though I may I'm not even

2988
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,760
the right person to do this because of

2989
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:14,960
my rep

2990
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,960
whether deserved or not

2991
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:21,060
I did it and I hope someone does it

2992
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:22,800
better even like I'm it's not even like

2993
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:24,539
it's not like this is the only one that

2994
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,860
can happen I want everyone to do this it

2995
01:52:24,539 --> 01:52:28,439
would be so much better if everybody had

2996
01:52:25,859 --> 01:52:31,439
syndicates out there I will say this as

2997
01:52:28,439 --> 01:52:34,079
like again a relative Outsider you know

2998
01:52:31,439 --> 01:52:36,118
just home growing hobbyist sure as

2999
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:38,158
someone who's kind of explored quite a

3000
01:52:36,118 --> 01:52:40,319
few of these different communities

3001
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:41,879
I and of course I'm biased now you know

3002
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:45,899
I'm kind of entrenched in The Syndicate

3003
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:48,118
but it is by far the most genuine

3004
01:52:45,899 --> 01:52:50,819
Community like canvas community that

3005
01:52:48,118 --> 01:52:52,319
I've found where you can have actual

3006
01:52:50,819 --> 01:52:55,019
genuine interactions with other people

3007
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:57,539
that are meaningful and that don't have

3008
01:52:55,020 --> 01:53:00,060
just this like constant backdrop of

3009
01:52:57,539 --> 01:53:02,158
marketing and sales which is what you do

3010
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:05,000
find at many of the other discords and

3011
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:07,138
communities sales pumping hard hard hard

3012
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,698
yeah like all the discords are

3013
01:53:07,139 --> 01:53:10,260
structured like shops basically yeah

3014
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:12,178
yeah that's what they are they're

3015
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:13,980
structured to be little cult shops

3016
01:53:12,179 --> 01:53:16,859
if we're being real like little mini

3017
01:53:13,979 --> 01:53:18,359
cult shops like here's me on a pedestal

3018
01:53:16,859 --> 01:53:21,479
on the man let me tell you what to buy

3019
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:24,000
and that's something that not only me

3020
01:53:21,479 --> 01:53:26,218
but Shawnee and other moderators like

3021
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,819
people that aren't breeders remind

3022
01:53:26,219 --> 01:53:33,000
people daily in our in ours because yeah

3023
01:53:29,819 --> 01:53:36,420
we want to kick over every statue in

3024
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,939
cannabis like not to disrespect but to

3025
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:40,920
for people to realize anyone can pop a

3026
01:53:38,939 --> 01:53:43,618
pack of seeds from anyone not from me

3027
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:45,118
from anyone even idiots you know like

3028
01:53:43,618 --> 01:53:46,799
you could buy seats from idiots and pop

3029
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:49,859
a pack of seats and find something that

3030
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:53,880
is as good as any Elite cut out there

3031
01:53:49,859 --> 01:53:55,859
it's anybody can do that you can educate

3032
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:57,900
yourself better to have better chances

3033
01:53:55,859 --> 01:53:59,698
at finding a good breeder who does

3034
01:53:57,899 --> 01:54:01,679
actual work that has the real clone that

3035
01:53:59,698 --> 01:54:04,198
you want with the traits you want that

3036
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:06,239
increases your odds and probably a

3037
01:54:04,198 --> 01:54:08,698
better way of spending money and your

3038
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:10,799
your Investments but anybody can pop

3039
01:54:08,698 --> 01:54:11,939
anything anytime that's equally as good

3040
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,980
as anything

3041
01:54:11,939 --> 01:54:15,479
that I've found and that's what we want

3042
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:18,299
to reinforce

3043
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:20,759
um pedestals

3044
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:23,400
they lead to nothing but disappointed

3045
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:24,239
you know because no one's perfect

3046
01:54:23,399 --> 01:54:26,939
um

3047
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:28,379
most people are [ __ ] most breeders

3048
01:54:26,939 --> 01:54:29,638
that like Flex like they're rich and

3049
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:31,739
like you want to be like them they're

3050
01:54:29,639 --> 01:54:33,840
not you know like that's a that's a

3051
01:54:31,738 --> 01:54:36,959
smoke of mirrors

3052
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:39,300
these aren't those days of Rich breeders

3053
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:41,579
um no yeah

3054
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:43,500
okay cool well that no that that's a

3055
01:54:41,579 --> 01:54:45,960
really nice kind of statement about you

3056
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:47,698
know at least part of your mission with

3057
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:49,020
The Syndicate and we'll come back to it

3058
01:54:47,698 --> 01:54:49,638
again

3059
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:53,280
um

3060
01:54:49,639 --> 01:54:55,460
for right now you know I didn't want to

3061
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:58,079
ask you you did mention it already sure

3062
01:54:55,460 --> 01:55:00,179
why do you think you know you are such a

3063
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:02,760
divisive figure you know what's happened

3064
01:55:00,179 --> 01:55:04,440
you know I'm not I I don't know any of

3065
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:06,199
these specific events but do you want to

3066
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:10,259
speak to any of the controversies

3067
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:12,059
straight for people yeah so

3068
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:13,619
all my life

3069
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:17,340
I can't she didn't say it all my life

3070
01:55:13,618 --> 01:55:19,738
too after second grade probably is when

3071
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:22,560
I became a little bit of a um I don't

3072
01:55:19,738 --> 01:55:24,178
say a monster right but maybe maybe some

3073
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,860
people might apply that

3074
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:27,079
um

3075
01:55:25,859 --> 01:55:30,719
I

3076
01:55:27,079 --> 01:55:32,460
the word polarizing has been used to

3077
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:34,920
describe me my whole life especially

3078
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:35,819
through High School

3079
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:38,399
um

3080
01:55:35,819 --> 01:55:41,219
adults used it a lot in high school in

3081
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:44,219
regards to me because I would push every

3082
01:55:41,219 --> 01:55:45,539
button and push every boundary

3083
01:55:44,219 --> 01:55:48,179
um

3084
01:55:45,539 --> 01:55:51,179
I would fight a lot you know I was a

3085
01:55:48,179 --> 01:55:53,100
short kid so I like had a big mouth and

3086
01:55:51,179 --> 01:55:54,658
that big mouth would make me fight a lot

3087
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:56,340
like I didn't really like fighting I

3088
01:55:54,658 --> 01:55:58,679
didn't want to get in the fights but

3089
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:00,480
because of my mouth I had to

3090
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:02,100
and

3091
01:56:00,479 --> 01:56:03,419
it's just it's one of those things like

3092
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:06,300
some people are on different spectrums

3093
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:10,158
and my spectrum is very little filter

3094
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:12,079
and I blame it on a head injury

3095
01:56:10,158 --> 01:56:14,638
but but

3096
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:16,800
yeah I know like I've always had that

3097
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:18,539
title of being a polarizing figure and

3098
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:22,020
when I came into cannabis it was no

3099
01:56:18,539 --> 01:56:23,579
different I mean I was a basically a

3100
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:25,860
punk rock guy

3101
01:56:23,579 --> 01:56:29,279
trying to bring those ideals

3102
01:56:25,859 --> 01:56:31,859
into the Grateful Dead type Community or

3103
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:34,679
in some cases the hip-hop rap

3104
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:35,279
dab type community

3105
01:56:34,679 --> 01:56:38,279
um

3106
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:39,719
and I was seeing a lot wrong on forums I

3107
01:56:38,279 --> 01:56:40,979
was seeing people say things that

3108
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:43,618
weren't true

3109
01:56:40,979 --> 01:56:45,118
I was seeing people openly lie to each

3110
01:56:43,618 --> 01:56:47,339
other and stab each other in the back

3111
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:48,779
just do nasty [ __ ] and so I'd say

3112
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:51,600
something

3113
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:55,139
and early on I realized the most common

3114
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:57,300
response is oh man bad vibes bro

3115
01:56:55,139 --> 01:57:01,859
why are you bringing bad vibes here

3116
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:04,500
we're good you know like hey man we know

3117
01:57:01,859 --> 01:57:08,219
all that bad vibes you know that was

3118
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:11,219
that was really what I got and just and

3119
01:57:08,219 --> 01:57:12,719
these forums I mean people again I talk

3120
01:57:11,219 --> 01:57:14,579
about this all the time but people

3121
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:16,380
nowadays trying to back read the forums

3122
01:57:14,579 --> 01:57:18,179
can't unless you're really good at using

3123
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:20,639
the Wayback machine and some of these

3124
01:57:18,179 --> 01:57:23,099
like clandestine forums are gone like

3125
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:24,300
not even on that site they weren't big

3126
01:57:23,099 --> 01:57:25,980
enough for that you know they weren't

3127
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:28,099
being indexed

3128
01:57:25,979 --> 01:57:28,098
um

3129
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:32,340
on these sites they were mostly seed

3130
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:34,020
banks and seed bank owners as we were

3131
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:35,880
talking about had agenda so like like on

3132
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:38,940
the discords

3133
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:41,460
if you spoke out against anyone or said

3134
01:57:38,939 --> 01:57:42,658
anything about anyone including them on

3135
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,319
their forum

3136
01:57:42,658 --> 01:57:45,319
you're gone

3137
01:57:45,479 --> 01:57:50,459
well

3138
01:57:47,579 --> 01:57:52,079
I seem to think that I was going to be

3139
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:53,460
immune to this or something or maybe I

3140
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:54,719
didn't care I really genuinely don't

3141
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:57,300
remember what I was thinking at the time

3142
01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:00,840
or why I think it was just emotional

3143
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:02,340
reactions to like this isn't fair why is

3144
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,840
this person getting [ __ ] over or why'd

3145
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:05,699
you keep my money when I sent it to you

3146
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,900
ever I'm going to tell people this so

3147
01:58:05,698 --> 01:58:09,479
that they don't have the same thing

3148
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:10,920
happen to them you kept my money where

3149
01:58:09,479 --> 01:58:13,559
is it

3150
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:15,840
um or any number of things you know like

3151
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,119
this breeder [ __ ] over my friend I

3152
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:20,219
have proof like why are you selling

3153
01:58:18,118 --> 01:58:21,960
their seeds are you a scumbag too

3154
01:58:20,219 --> 01:58:23,219
so I just pretty much removed from every

3155
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:25,679
forum

3156
01:58:23,219 --> 01:58:28,920
uh one of the biggest I think things

3157
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:32,460
that is stuck that dry that drives me

3158
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:35,699
the nuttiest is a story about the the

3159
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:37,920

3166
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:55,198
early on and it helped her

3167
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:56,760
a lot tremendously he said and I didn't

3168

01:59:30,779 --> 01:59:33,960
because that's how it works like half is

3185
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:36,300
what's

3186
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:37,920
I don't work any other way and not not

3187
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:40,679
only because I feel like I'm a generous

3188
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:43,319
dude I feel like

3189
01:59:40,679 --> 01:59:46,618
I feel like that leads to resentment if

3190
01:59:43,319 --> 01:59:48,539
people aren't if everything's not 100 or

3191
01:59:46,618 --> 01:59:50,098
like even it will always lead to

3192
01:59:48,539 --> 01:59:52,679
resentment or could potentially and I

3193
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:54,420
don't like losing friends like I want

3194
01:59:52,679 --> 01:59:55,800
everybody to feel like we're all on the

3195
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:57,480
same page if I'm making money you're

3196
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:59,880
making as much as me right

3197
01:59:57,479 --> 02:00:01,738
yeah so he sent me the pictures for it I

3198
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:03,779
put them up and this is when I just

3199
02:00:01,738 --> 02:00:06,000
started working with the attitude

3200
02:00:03,779 --> 02:00:08,819
just started working with the attitude

3201
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,560
they got the seeds put up the pictures

3202
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:12,658
which I should say that was a big deal

3203
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:14,460
at the time oh yeah I was I was the

3204
02:00:12,658 --> 02:00:15,839
second American ever on the attitude

3205
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:18,000
when you're on the attitude it was like

3206
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:20,279
making it in High Times it was me and

3207
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,899
sub cool

3208
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:25,079
so

3209
02:00:21,899 --> 02:00:28,198
I had to hit up the attitude when so so

3210
02:00:25,079 --> 02:00:29,519
I'm sorry Heath Robinson went on the

3211
02:00:28,198 --> 02:00:31,019
attitude saw those pictures like there's

3212
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:32,239

3213
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:34,500
I was like oh

3214
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:37,079
he's like well it looked like the mom

3215
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:40,340
the best and I'm like oh brother because

3216
02:00:37,079 --> 02:00:42,960
he didn't know like he's not right

3217
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:44,279
and I wasn't looking all over Heath

3218
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,198

3236
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:30,899
thief and clone Thief

3237
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:33,480
and like I'm not gonna blame it on

3238
02:01:30,899 --> 02:01:35,460
skunko I should have done the the the

3239
02:01:33,479 --> 02:01:37,138
work because I knew Heath I should have

3240
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:38,460
I guess I should have asked him are

3241
02:01:37,139 --> 02:01:40,380
these pictures yours but I never would

3242
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:42,359
have assumed that like no but that's

3243
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:44,159
like an unknown like you didn't know you

3244
02:01:42,359 --> 02:01:45,960
didn't know that like I didn't know that

3245
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:48,238
skoko didn't even know that wasn't what

3246
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:50,399
you do because and the thing is in In

3247
02:01:48,238 --> 02:01:51,899
fairness to skunko that's what people

3248
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:53,819
[ __ ] did

3249
02:01:51,899 --> 02:01:54,960
right they put up pictures of their mom

3250
02:01:53,819 --> 02:01:57,779
plants

3251
02:01:54,960 --> 02:02:00,000
as the seed plant saying this is a mom

3252
02:01:57,779 --> 02:02:02,939
expect to get something like this that's

3253
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:05,300
what people did so I figured that's what

3254
02:02:02,939 --> 02:02:05,299
he was doing

3255
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:10,560
but yeah anyways yeah that's the heath

3256
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:12,118
Robinson controversy um early on when I

3257
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:14,820
got the seeds

3258
02:02:12,118 --> 02:02:18,000
um I gave him I'm sorry I gave his buddy

3259
02:02:14,819 --> 02:02:20,639
this is where it gets kooky real kooky I

3260
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:24,560
gave his buddy this guy Nutella on the

3261
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:27,000
Canon Cabana I gave his buddy a bunch of

3262
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:30,539
it was the very last

3263
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:33,238
of my Apollo 13 seeds I think he got is

3264
02:02:30,539 --> 02:02:34,679
something like that and he want it was

3265
02:02:33,238 --> 02:02:36,118
something very rare that he wanted

3266
02:02:34,679 --> 02:02:38,158
Brothers Grim was gone there was no

3267
02:02:36,118 --> 02:02:41,098
Apollo 13 sub cool hadn't made Apollo 13

3268
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:42,899
px1 it was all there was and he wanted

3269
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:43,980
him so bad and I was like oh bro I don't

3270
02:02:42,899 --> 02:02:46,500
know and he's like hey I'm friends with

3271
02:02:43,979 --> 02:02:48,178
Heath Robinson I know you like purples I

3272
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:50,039
can get you a bunch of those seeds dude

3273
02:02:48,179 --> 02:02:52,500
I was like all right well fine here take

3274
02:02:50,039 --> 02:02:54,840
him and he sent me the seeds

3275
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:56,460
but he's had the idea that he had gifted

3276
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:57,779
me these and I had done nothing with

3277
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:59,520
them like I had not sent him anything

3278
02:02:57,779 --> 02:03:02,519
back

3279
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:05,119
in my mind I had traded his friend for

3280
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:05,119
those seeds

3281
02:03:05,179 --> 02:03:12,179
right so he's mine I'm a [ __ ] thief

3282
02:03:09,359 --> 02:03:14,279
who did all this

3283
02:03:12,179 --> 02:03:16,920
so it didn't reciprocate yeah it didn't

3284
02:03:14,279 --> 02:03:19,340
reciprocate and then used his picture

3285
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:22,260
so when I say perspective is everything

3286
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:23,699
I get his perspective it's because he

3287
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:27,179
wasn't informed and we never spoke after

3288
02:03:23,698 --> 02:03:29,098
because he lost his [ __ ] and because I'm

3289
02:03:27,179 --> 02:03:32,579
the person I am I was like you you don't

3290
02:03:29,099 --> 02:03:34,500
know the story [ __ ] you right

3291
02:03:32,579 --> 02:03:36,238
so that's how that goes

3292
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:40,139
it was bad on my part because I didn't

3293
02:03:36,238 --> 02:03:41,638
do my due diligence which I mean it was

3294
02:03:40,139 --> 02:03:44,460
a granted it was it would have been a

3295
02:03:41,639 --> 02:03:47,099
lot of due diligence secondly I didn't

3296
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:48,658
react the way I should have

3297
02:03:47,099 --> 02:03:51,360
because I mean it was a very easy

3298
02:03:48,658 --> 02:03:52,439
explanation but I felt at the time if I

3299
02:03:51,359 --> 02:03:54,059
explained that I'm going to be throwing

3300
02:03:52,439 --> 02:03:56,460
skunko under the bus

3301
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:58,560
who's a very sweet heart person not a

3302
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:00,300
breeder has no drama in his life and

3303
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:02,340
doesn't deserve that

3304
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:04,260
yeah or

3305
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:07,980
and all to placate someone who's being

3306
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:10,320
an [ __ ] to me and actually his crew

3307
02:04:07,979 --> 02:04:11,939
got something and maybe his best

3308
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:13,139
friend's lying to him and telling him I

3309
02:04:11,939 --> 02:04:15,359
didn't get anything but that's not the

3310
02:04:13,139 --> 02:04:17,880
case so I'm thinking you're a [ __ ]

3311
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:21,719
and you roll with [ __ ]

3312
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:24,719
yeah so that's that's literally the

3313
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:27,840
whole basis for every clone Thief clone

3314
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:29,340
this clone that he stole this from me

3315
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:31,139
he's not

3316
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:33,300
is it

3317
02:04:31,139 --> 02:04:36,118
in a nutshell

3318
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:38,820
um and and when I talk about me and res

3319
02:04:36,118 --> 02:04:41,098
dog having the dark mark

3320
02:04:38,819 --> 02:04:42,238
it's true like I really really truly

3321
02:04:41,099 --> 02:04:44,039
believe that

3322
02:04:42,238 --> 02:04:45,658
um there's no one else who has the [ __ ]

3323
02:04:44,039 --> 02:04:47,158
stain on cannabis like when you mention

3324
02:04:45,658 --> 02:04:50,579
their name except for me and resd dog

3325
02:04:47,158 --> 02:04:52,738
and resdog actually snitched on people

3326
02:04:50,579 --> 02:04:56,039
and this is my dark mark is the heath

3327
02:04:52,738 --> 02:04:58,559
Robinson Black Rose Fiasco and you know

3328
02:04:56,039 --> 02:05:00,420
it's bizarre to me because you know I've

3329
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:02,760
never heard that story before but it

3330
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:04,739
just seemed like these really in the end

3331
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:06,719
quite I know they're not small but you

3332
02:05:04,738 --> 02:05:09,359
know kind of small things that just

3333
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:11,698
added up in quite a step way

3334
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:13,679
yep yeah things that last you like three

3335
02:05:11,698 --> 02:05:15,539
hours like and I didn't even know the

3336
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:16,859
attitude and me so that was the first

3337
02:05:15,539 --> 02:05:18,479
step with the attitude where I was like

3338
02:05:16,859 --> 02:05:19,920
oh I gotta tell them take these pictures

3339
02:05:18,479 --> 02:05:21,658
down

3340
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,880
second thing that happened

3341
02:05:21,658 --> 02:05:25,859
was sub cool

3342
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:27,719
went to them because me and sub cool

3343
02:05:25,859 --> 02:05:29,639
were not super friendly but we didn't

3344
02:05:27,719 --> 02:05:31,198
like fight yet like we weren't friendly

3345
02:05:29,639 --> 02:05:33,239
but he did not like that another

3346
02:05:31,198 --> 02:05:35,279
American was on the attitude with him at

3347
02:05:33,238 --> 02:05:37,198
odd if anybody knows Monty yeah or new

3348
02:05:35,279 --> 02:05:39,539
Monty this was Monty

3349
02:05:37,198 --> 02:05:42,178
so he went to I would say her name was

3350
02:05:39,539 --> 02:05:44,219
Natalia that owned the attitude I think

3351
02:05:42,179 --> 02:05:46,679
she still owns it at the time and said

3352
02:05:44,219 --> 02:05:48,118
Matthew Riot is a bad [ __ ] person and

3353
02:05:46,679 --> 02:05:49,800
you shouldn't do business with him and

3354
02:05:48,118 --> 02:05:51,420
she actually showed me the screenshot of

3355
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:53,340
the email

3356
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:55,560
and she said you know if we go to

3357
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:57,300
parties with sub cool he's our biggest

3358
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:59,760
money maker

3359
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:02,279
and I believe him if he says you're a

3360
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,239
piece of [ __ ] then I trust this man and

3361
02:06:02,279 --> 02:06:04,800
we're not gonna do any more business

3362
02:06:03,238 --> 02:06:07,379
with you thank you

3363
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:09,360
wow at this time

3364
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:11,460
I was making this is when I was making

3365
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:12,658
serious money once he's like that was

3366
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:13,980
the first time I'd made serious money

3367
02:06:12,658 --> 02:06:15,899
when you make it to the attitude you can

3368
02:06:13,979 --> 02:06:19,279
make serious money

3369
02:06:15,899 --> 02:06:22,319
and yeah and I thought that was awesome

3370
02:06:19,279 --> 02:06:24,300
you know that I was doing that and I

3371
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:25,859
felt like I had finally made it you know

3372
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:28,440
and

3373
02:06:25,859 --> 02:06:29,158
we are helping my grandma with her her

3374
02:06:28,439 --> 02:06:30,899
um

3375
02:06:29,158 --> 02:06:33,179
her her nursing home bills at the time

3376
02:06:30,899 --> 02:06:35,219
because she had been in a in a meadow

3377
02:06:33,179 --> 02:06:37,199
like a really nice one she didn't want

3378
02:06:35,219 --> 02:06:38,579
me taking care of her growing weed you

3379
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:40,698
know so she wanted to be a house where

3380
02:06:38,579 --> 02:06:44,460
we just drunk she's an old Mexican lady

3381
02:06:40,698 --> 02:06:46,198
so yeah so

3382
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:50,698
um or was I sorry

3383
02:06:46,198 --> 02:06:52,618
we were talking about the controversies

3384
02:06:50,698 --> 02:06:54,419
um that was yeah my brain brought me in

3385
02:06:52,618 --> 02:06:57,000
some and I was like what is this and

3386
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:59,399
then I got all distracted with my ADHD

3387
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,560
no that's okay you're essentially

3388
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:03,118
telling us about the attitude oh the

3389
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:06,360
attitude okay

3390
02:07:03,118 --> 02:07:07,859
yeah um so he said you know oh so I was

3391
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:09,118
helping take care of my grandma at her

3392
02:07:07,859 --> 02:07:10,799
nursing home with money at that time and

3393
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:12,299
it was really secure I thought because

3394
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,639
like I had this great relationship they

3395
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:17,159
were buying seeds and that came to a

3396
02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:20,099
[ __ ] sudden halt

3397
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:22,979
so it caused a lot like livelihood wise

3398
02:07:20,099 --> 02:07:25,260
like I had to sell her house

3399
02:07:22,979 --> 02:07:26,759
to pay for her medical bills like

3400
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:28,800
granted she wasn't living there but this

3401
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:30,239
is the family's house now that had to

3402
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:33,360
get sold

3403
02:07:30,238 --> 02:07:36,000
and the whole time I had to hear her cry

3404
02:07:33,359 --> 02:07:37,380
about wanting to go home and there was

3405
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,979
no home to go to

3406
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:43,679
oh my God so that which for me like that

3407
02:07:40,979 --> 02:07:45,658
rage that I had for sub cool and it was

3408
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,118
just like compounding [ __ ] like that

3409
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:51,238
like there must have been traumatic it

3410
02:07:48,118 --> 02:07:53,039
was hard it's hard but and I [ __ ] you

3411
02:07:51,238 --> 02:07:54,419
not after I got released from the

3412
02:07:53,039 --> 02:07:56,460
attitude it was going from making like

3413
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:57,899
10 000 a week

3414
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:01,920
to

3415
02:07:57,899 --> 02:08:04,920
holy [ __ ] I made 75 over the period of

3416
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:06,719
the next four months because me getting

3417
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:08,099
removed from the attitude meant

3418
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:10,020
everybody saw it

3419
02:08:08,099 --> 02:08:12,420
and it confirmed that everyone thought

3420
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:14,219
that I was a [ __ ] bag

3421
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:16,260
because it was public you know like them

3422
02:08:14,219 --> 02:08:19,980
seeing that happen

3423
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:21,539
my God and yeah and I was like it was it

3424
02:08:19,979 --> 02:08:22,979
was devastating because this is not even

3425
02:08:21,539 --> 02:08:25,139
this is during the heath Robinson thing

3426
02:08:22,979 --> 02:08:27,718
too so it was like just

3427
02:08:25,139 --> 02:08:29,460
compounded compounded and that's

3428
02:08:27,719 --> 02:08:31,618
probably when I became the most hateful

3429
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:34,139
and the most mean

3430
02:08:31,618 --> 02:08:36,598
possible yeah and I was like dude all

3431
02:08:34,139 --> 02:08:38,340
these people think I'm an [ __ ] all of

3432
02:08:36,599 --> 02:08:39,900
them think I'm a [ __ ] bag heel they all

3433
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:42,420
think I'm a bad person

3434
02:08:39,899 --> 02:08:43,859
[ __ ] them I'll be the worst heal they

3435
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:45,719
can [ __ ] imagine

3436
02:08:43,859 --> 02:08:48,000
you know like and I'm gonna make the

3437
02:08:45,719 --> 02:08:49,980
best stuff I can while I'm doing it I

3438
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,899
will be the worst [ __ ] hero every con

3439
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:54,299
artist I'm gonna figure out everything

3440
02:08:51,899 --> 02:08:56,279
everyone's [ __ ] done every dirty

3441
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:57,659
[ __ ] Deed all these [ __ ] you know

3442
02:08:56,279 --> 02:08:59,099
that are pulling [ __ ] on me I'm gonna

3443
02:08:57,658 --> 02:09:01,679
figure out everything they've ever done

3444
02:08:59,099 --> 02:09:03,480
genetically and [ __ ] press them up

3445
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:05,399
against the wall and make them [ __ ]

3446
02:09:03,479 --> 02:09:07,559
pay and that's what I did so this is

3447
02:09:05,399 --> 02:09:10,559
like the the origin of the like

3448
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:13,320
anti-hero slash villain knock yeah this

3449
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:15,119
is this is the origin of Matt Riot

3450
02:09:13,319 --> 02:09:17,279
proper granted I had that name or since

3451
02:09:15,118 --> 02:09:19,559
I was a little kid in punk bands

3452
02:09:17,279 --> 02:09:21,420
um yeah like like my best friend's

3453
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:23,460
sister who is a riot girl back in the

3454
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:24,779
day like and that's like a feminist punk

3455
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:26,219
rock organization that's right I'm

3456
02:09:24,779 --> 02:09:27,840
political yeah I would be real like a

3457
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:29,520
chauvinist little pig to her and so

3458
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,599
she'd call me a riot boy because I was

3459
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:31,980
being a chauvinist Pig which is the

3460
02:09:30,599 --> 02:09:33,060
opposite of right girl you know so you

3461
02:09:31,979 --> 02:09:35,638
call me right boy so that's why that

3462
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:37,920
name's stuck right this is the the

3463
02:09:35,639 --> 02:09:41,699
Genesis of

3464
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:44,340
that name in cannabis and why like heel

3465
02:09:41,698 --> 02:09:46,738
is associated with that name that those

3466
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:48,060
months and granted at first I was

3467
02:09:46,738 --> 02:09:48,959
getting kicked off forms and pushing

3468
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:51,480
back

3469
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:54,539
but this is when I was like uh

3470
02:09:51,479 --> 02:09:58,019
no like I'm gonna get the best at this I

3471
02:09:54,539 --> 02:10:00,719
possibly can to where my I'm not

3472
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:02,159
throwing breaks from a glass house I'm

3473
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:03,118
never gonna make these mistakes like

3474
02:10:02,158 --> 02:10:05,819
this again

3475
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:07,319
ever yeah and I'm gonna [ __ ] nail all

3476
02:10:05,819 --> 02:10:09,539
them to the wall every last one

3477
02:10:07,319 --> 02:10:11,158
including subcool

3478
02:10:09,539 --> 02:10:12,420
because I felt like it was done to me it

3479
02:10:11,158 --> 02:10:14,219
was a little bit of a victim mentality

3480
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:17,099
which is stupid because in reality like

3481
02:10:14,219 --> 02:10:18,539
there are things I could have done to

3482
02:10:17,099 --> 02:10:19,800
probably have a better reputation I

3483
02:10:18,539 --> 02:10:23,039
could have kissed his ass I could have

3484
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:24,420
been nice despite not liking him and

3485
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:27,179
everything would have been probably

3486
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:29,520
hunky-dory but

3487
02:10:27,179 --> 02:10:31,859
I mean hindsight right hindsight yeah

3488
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,360
and and I didn't need to be mean I

3489
02:10:31,859 --> 02:10:35,158
didn't need to question everyone at the

3490
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:36,539
beginning like that's true other people

3491
02:10:35,158 --> 02:10:37,799
were successful because they didn't do

3492
02:10:36,539 --> 02:10:40,439
that and it probably would have been

3493
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:42,300
successful and

3494
02:10:40,439 --> 02:10:44,039
so it's not the way the way I was

3495
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:44,820
thinking at the time was you did this to

3496
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:47,760
me

3497
02:10:44,819 --> 02:10:49,500
right yeah so that had to change in my

3498
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:52,020
mind and it took a while it took a while

3499
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:53,460
to change yeah yeah because that I don't

3500
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:55,860
want to ask you about that next which

3501
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:57,840
was like what was that period like of

3502
02:10:55,859 --> 02:11:00,719
like recovering getting back on your

3503
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:02,639
feet after this

3504
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:06,179
it took all the way

3505
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:08,520
up until probably Instagram okay

3506
02:11:06,179 --> 02:11:10,618
right and

3507
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:12,119
people [ __ ] hated my guts I'm not

3508
02:11:10,618 --> 02:11:14,279
even kidding you like it just every

3509
02:11:12,118 --> 02:11:16,139
every day I would have emails saying

3510
02:11:14,279 --> 02:11:17,698
like hey I heard you're an [ __ ] can

3511
02:11:16,139 --> 02:11:19,319
you tell me why you're not and my first

3512
02:11:17,698 --> 02:11:21,000
response is [ __ ] you I'm not gonna

3513
02:11:19,319 --> 02:11:22,738
politic for your likes if you weren't

3514
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,198
around during that time and you the

3515
02:11:22,738 --> 02:11:27,059
first words to me or I heard you're an

3516
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:29,698
[ __ ] you're not gonna get a response

3517
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:31,560
and this was daily everyone just

3518
02:11:29,698 --> 02:11:33,598
so I didn't make a lot of money dude

3519
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:36,780
yeah I never made a lot of money in

3520
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:38,819
cannabis seeds I just didn't yeah that's

3521
02:11:36,779 --> 02:11:40,679
that that was the last time I made great

3522
02:11:38,819 --> 02:11:43,559
money in cannabis

3523
02:11:40,679 --> 02:11:46,500
um and I don't care like I got to breed

3524
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:48,599
anyways and I managed but once Instagram

3525
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:51,539
came around and live streaming happened

3526
02:11:48,599 --> 02:11:52,739
I was able to go on live streams and

3527
02:11:51,539 --> 02:11:55,198
people were able to ask me questions

3528
02:11:52,738 --> 02:11:57,598
directly and see my face see my

3529
02:11:55,198 --> 02:11:59,939
mannerisms hear my words and for some

3530
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:02,699
reason that changed a lot not everything

3531
02:11:59,939 --> 02:12:04,198
it's been very slow

3532
02:12:02,698 --> 02:12:06,479
but

3533
02:12:04,198 --> 02:12:07,439
it changed it did change something and I

3534
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:09,059
don't know why I think it's still

3535
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:11,279
happening I think it's still happening

3536
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:15,840
as well probably I mean like

3537
02:12:11,279 --> 02:12:18,000
and to me that's a very slow change but

3538
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,619
you know I don't know why I I guess be

3539
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,179
and the way I looked at it was I'm gonna

3540
02:12:19,618 --> 02:12:23,098
do this because I don't see any other

3541
02:12:21,179 --> 02:12:26,520
breeders doing this they're competent at

3542
02:12:23,099 --> 02:12:27,900
this and if I do this and I speak

3543
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:29,580
confidently

3544
02:12:27,899 --> 02:12:31,079
hopefully people will learn enough to be

3545
02:12:29,579 --> 02:12:33,118
able to then ask readers the right

3546
02:12:31,079 --> 02:12:35,698
questions to get them to put their feet

3547
02:12:33,118 --> 02:12:37,979
to the fire like essentially

3548
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:39,658
I think yeah another another take I have

3549
02:12:37,979 --> 02:12:41,098
on this is that your strategy kind of

3550
02:12:39,658 --> 02:12:43,799
shifted to just being like look I'm just

3551
02:12:41,099 --> 02:12:45,659
gonna like do the work yeah that's it

3552
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:47,400
like and and that was the part of the

3553
02:12:45,658 --> 02:12:52,098
heal thing too is like I'm just gonna

3554
02:12:47,399 --> 02:12:52,098
work as hard as I can and [ __ ] you

3555
02:12:52,279 --> 02:12:57,059
yeah exactly let the work do the talking

3556
02:12:54,779 --> 02:13:01,519
right exactly

3557
02:12:57,060 --> 02:13:01,520
yeah that's this is the best I could do

3558
02:13:01,618 --> 02:13:05,219
is this a good point to segue then

3559
02:13:03,719 --> 02:13:06,539
because I was going to ask you next you

3560
02:13:05,219 --> 02:13:08,698
know the next section is going to be

3561
02:13:06,539 --> 02:13:11,340
about returning to that sense of

3562
02:13:08,698 --> 02:13:13,799
community spirit and I think one thing

3563
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:16,199
that I is obvious to me in talking to

3564
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:18,960
you today is that

3565
02:13:16,198 --> 02:13:21,178
your ties to the community

3566
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:23,719
uh pervasive like you you know whether

3567
02:13:21,179 --> 02:13:26,819
for good or bad you've always been

3568
02:13:23,719 --> 02:13:28,618
interested and invested in community

3569
02:13:26,819 --> 02:13:30,899
relationships yeah and the furniture

3570
02:13:28,618 --> 02:13:32,698
cannabis I don't go away

3571
02:13:30,899 --> 02:13:34,500
bad Furniture someone's someone

3572
02:13:32,698 --> 02:13:36,539
someone's Lazy Boy

3573
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:38,939
but you've built this thing called breed

3574
02:13:36,539 --> 02:13:40,319
of Syndicate and you know you didn't

3575
02:13:38,939 --> 02:13:41,460
mention you didn't name drop this thing

3576
02:13:40,319 --> 02:13:44,960
which I'm not I don't know if it's a

3577
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:47,158
meme or not can Illuminati but how did

3578
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:49,618
you come up with the idea for The

3579
02:13:47,158 --> 02:13:53,399
Syndicate when did you mean not so like

3580
02:13:49,618 --> 02:13:57,179
how you know what were these events like

3581
02:13:53,399 --> 02:13:59,399
um I'll probably skip one part and then

3582
02:13:57,179 --> 02:14:00,300
we'll go straight into The Syndicate so

3583
02:13:59,399 --> 02:14:03,719
um

3584
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:06,840
how did I meet not so he was he was

3585
02:14:03,719 --> 02:14:08,939
good friends with CSI

3586
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:10,920
um and CSI knew him as the Mendo perps

3587
02:14:08,939 --> 02:14:14,219
guy for years like going to old parties

3588
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:16,679
in in Mendo and back to back to the NCGA

3589
02:14:14,219 --> 02:14:17,460
parties a lot of people don't know about

3590
02:14:16,679 --> 02:14:20,578
um

3591
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:22,078
and events he met not so dog there in

3592
02:14:20,578 --> 02:14:25,380
mindo and not so dog was of course known

3593
02:14:22,078 --> 02:14:27,118
as the Kim 91 [ __ ] menopurps guy

3594
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:28,500
and one day I get a message on Instagram

3595
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:30,059
from a dude

3596
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:32,279
he's like hey I heard you got this

3597
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:34,199
Afghani clone that's skunky tell me

3598
02:14:32,279 --> 02:14:36,179
about it

3599
02:14:34,198 --> 02:14:38,519
so we start talking

3600
02:14:36,179 --> 02:14:41,340
and the guy's super nice and super

3601
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:42,960
competent I'm like who is this guy

3602
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:44,819
so I asked Caleb have you ever heard of

3603
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:46,260
this dude he's like yeah it's my buddy

3604
02:14:44,819 --> 02:14:46,920
that's my boy that's a mental purpose

3605
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:48,539
guy

3606
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:50,219
and of course not so hadn't mentioned it

3607
02:14:48,539 --> 02:14:51,420
he's the mental purse guy that he's had

3608
02:14:50,219 --> 02:14:52,560
anything to do with Cam he's just some

3609
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:55,078
normal dude asked me questions about

3610
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:56,280
Afghani no it's not in the Forefront he

3611
02:14:55,078 --> 02:14:59,759
doesn't put that in the Forefront back

3612
02:14:56,279 --> 02:15:02,099
then and um so I start having more deep

3613
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:04,020
conversations with him and the guy is

3614
02:15:02,099 --> 02:15:05,760
just an amazing talker and only that

3615
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:07,079
like he's got amazing things to say and

3616
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:09,420
amazing history

3617
02:15:07,078 --> 02:15:12,359
and during this time Discord popped up

3618
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:13,199
and I was on one from someone else who

3619
02:15:12,359 --> 02:15:15,960
created

3620
02:15:13,198 --> 02:15:17,460
and I brought I was like hey I have a

3621
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:19,198
friend named not so dog and I think

3622
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:21,480
everybody should hear him talk let's do

3623
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:23,339
a voice chat for the first time and

3624
02:15:21,479 --> 02:15:24,299
let's see let's see how people react to

3625
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:25,679
him because I think he's got an

3626
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:28,320
interesting story and that was the first

3627
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:31,078
time I interviewed not so unrecorded for

3628
02:15:28,319 --> 02:15:32,698
three hours on a Discord called the

3629
02:15:31,078 --> 02:15:33,599
Northwest 47 back then I don't know what

3630
02:15:32,698 --> 02:15:35,158
it's called today or if it's even

3631
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:37,199
existing but

3632
02:15:35,158 --> 02:15:38,279
um yeah that was the first time I

3633
02:15:37,198 --> 02:15:42,059
interviewed knots and that's when I

3634
02:15:38,279 --> 02:15:43,979
realized me and this guy have chemistry

3635
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:45,840
and maybe we should do this more often

3636
02:15:43,979 --> 02:15:48,118
and talk about other things

3637
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:50,039
yeah you start dating we started dating

3638
02:15:48,118 --> 02:15:51,179
weekend boyfriends and he was a good

3639
02:15:50,039 --> 02:15:53,698
kisser

3640
02:15:51,179 --> 02:15:56,880
and it was just the way he held me so

3641
02:15:53,698 --> 02:15:58,859
tight at night that the chemistry body

3642
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:00,539
chemistry and maybe it's his pheromones

3643
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:02,399
something about it

3644
02:16:00,539 --> 02:16:04,760
um drove me to him

3645
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:04,759
yeah yeah

3646
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:10,139
and like yeah okay so you meant not so

3647
02:16:07,738 --> 02:16:12,618
and then when did The Syndicate concept

3648
02:16:10,139 --> 02:16:15,539
arise

3649
02:16:12,618 --> 02:16:17,839
The Syndicate concept kind of rised

3650
02:16:15,539 --> 02:16:20,939
early on when I realized that

3651
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:23,039
me not so CSI everyone's not going to

3652
02:16:20,939 --> 02:16:25,379
have retirement

3653
02:16:23,039 --> 02:16:28,078
um there are people above me that were

3654
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:30,179
getting sick older people were getting

3655
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:31,859
sick and had nothing and I'm like we

3656
02:16:30,179 --> 02:16:34,200
need a union guys

3657
02:16:31,859 --> 02:16:36,959
something like thinking like totally out

3658
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:38,700
of the box like impossibly maybe but

3659
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:40,739
that was the first idea of The Syndicate

3660
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:42,179
was just like this has to happen you

3661
02:16:40,739 --> 02:16:46,439
know and then slowly our friend group

3662
02:16:42,179 --> 02:16:49,978
started getting bigger and bigger and

3663
02:16:46,439 --> 02:16:52,079
there was more interest and

3664
02:16:49,978 --> 02:16:54,420
it's just like we all started talking

3665
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:56,879
about strains and history and bringing

3666
02:16:54,420 --> 02:17:00,719
what we had to the table and it became a

3667
02:16:56,879 --> 02:17:02,759
24 7 thing on our own little area

3668
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:04,438
and this group formed and we'd all

3669
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:06,898
decided that it was time to try to take

3670
02:17:04,439 --> 02:17:10,679
this bigger and that's when we started

3671
02:17:06,898 --> 02:17:13,199
doing reader Syndicate podcast

3672
02:17:10,679 --> 02:17:15,000
and that was it like we just kind of

3673
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:16,740
fumbled our way through this and made it

3674
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,138
here after I don't even know how long

3675
02:17:16,739 --> 02:17:21,119
it's been a few years maybe

3676
02:17:19,138 --> 02:17:23,279
yeah how long has it been I I'm yeah

3677
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:25,380
I've never known that actually I assume

3678
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:27,960
it's like a three to four years

3679
02:17:25,379 --> 02:17:30,898
something like that yeah

3680
02:17:27,959 --> 02:17:34,018
yeah okay yeah because that was you know

3681
02:17:30,898 --> 02:17:37,199
you mentioned thinking about the

3682
02:17:34,019 --> 02:17:39,898
livelihoods and the sustainability of uh

3683
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:41,099
breeders and breeding yeah um and

3684
02:17:39,898 --> 02:17:43,019
because my next question was gonna be

3685
02:17:41,099 --> 02:17:45,780
you know what is your hope for this

3686
02:17:43,019 --> 02:17:47,340
group of people what is yourself the

3687
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:50,040
ultimate goal for The Syndicate would be

3688
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:53,819
for everybody that the Legacy farmers

3689
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:56,939
and uh to be taken care of with

3690
02:17:53,819 --> 02:17:59,879
some kind of Union I don't even know how

3691
02:17:56,939 --> 02:18:01,200
that works I don't know how it happens I

3692
02:17:59,879 --> 02:18:02,579
want to I want everyone to have health

3693
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:04,380
care I want everyone to have the same

3694
02:18:02,579 --> 02:18:05,218
thing that everybody else should have

3695
02:18:04,379 --> 02:18:05,938
yeah

3696
02:18:05,218 --> 02:18:08,879
um

3697
02:18:05,939 --> 02:18:11,398
I want I I like there to be a place

3698
02:18:08,879 --> 02:18:14,218
where people can go where they know

3699
02:18:11,398 --> 02:18:17,579
people have at least done their due

3700
02:18:14,218 --> 02:18:19,858
diligence to find the history right and

3701
02:18:17,579 --> 02:18:22,620
have that accessible and not be just a

3702
02:18:19,859 --> 02:18:24,780
gender-filled history and

3703
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:27,599
that's been that's hard that's hard

3704
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:29,219
because yeah when you're when you make

3705
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:30,719
money in cannabis

3706
02:18:29,218 --> 02:18:32,819
everyone's gonna assume that you're

3707
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:34,018
doing it for selfish reasons because a

3708
02:18:32,819 --> 02:18:35,398
lot of those people are selfish and

3709
02:18:34,019 --> 02:18:37,620
would do it for selfish reasons so they

3710
02:18:35,398 --> 02:18:38,879
don't understand why they can't

3711
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:41,880
um

3712
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:43,319
but maybe part of that Spectrum side is

3713
02:18:41,879 --> 02:18:46,018
what brought a lot of us together too

3714
02:18:43,319 --> 02:18:48,299
because we were also narrowly focused in

3715
02:18:46,019 --> 02:18:50,460
ADHD on making sure we get this history

3716
02:18:48,299 --> 02:18:53,518
right that that's the one thing a lot of

3717
02:18:50,459 --> 02:18:56,279
us gel on you know yes like our overall

3718
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:58,859
love Falls for getting this right and

3719
02:18:56,280 --> 02:19:00,359
misinformation just add absolutely makes

3720
02:18:58,859 --> 02:19:03,840
my stomach hurt

3721
02:19:00,359 --> 02:19:05,880
so it's like it's some of that it's some

3722
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,079
of my OCD that just inherently makes me

3723
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:10,319
want to push

3724
02:19:07,079 --> 02:19:12,959
a lot of it is that I love these people

3725
02:19:10,319 --> 02:19:15,539
my friends I absolutely love them and I

3726
02:19:12,959 --> 02:19:17,459
want them to do well and yeah I see a

3727
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:20,040
lot of [ __ ] bags progressing cannabis

3728
02:19:17,459 --> 02:19:22,138
and I don't understand I understand why

3729
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:25,559
and how that's happened I don't

3730
02:19:22,138 --> 02:19:28,138
understand how to fix that and I didn't

3731
02:19:25,558 --> 02:19:30,959
see anybody else really giving it a try

3732
02:19:28,138 --> 02:19:33,299
and this was my best attempt at it thank

3733
02:19:30,959 --> 02:19:35,459
I mean I still got other stuff

3734
02:19:33,299 --> 02:19:36,478
trying this at all no nobody's trying

3735
02:19:35,459 --> 02:19:38,159
but

3736
02:19:36,478 --> 02:19:41,579
the people that have stepped up whether

3737
02:19:38,159 --> 02:19:44,760
it be you Shawnee not so

3738
02:19:41,579 --> 02:19:48,420
uh goat farm high and Lonesome bitter

3739
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:51,359
Denali everybody ZB like

3740
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:52,859
yep it's it's it's been necessary for

3741
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:55,079
everybody to be a part of for it to get

3742
02:19:52,859 --> 02:19:56,700
where it's at and so like I don't like

3743
02:19:55,079 --> 02:19:58,319
talking about me starting anything

3744
02:19:56,700 --> 02:20:00,659
because

3745
02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:02,520
it wasn't me that started it it formed

3746
02:20:00,659 --> 02:20:05,159
and became it I just came up with the

3747
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:08,460
name we'll say that it emerged right it

3748
02:20:05,159 --> 02:20:10,739
emerged yeah it definitely emerged

3749
02:20:08,459 --> 02:20:12,779
very cool and that's really special to

3750
02:20:10,739 --> 02:20:14,340
hear because I don't I'm sure you've

3751
02:20:12,780 --> 02:20:15,600
alluded and implied a lot of these

3752
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:17,280
things when we took when you know in

3753
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:18,659
other podcasts and in our chats and

3754
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:20,040
stuff but I think it's really cool to

3755
02:20:18,659 --> 02:20:22,859
kind of like

3756
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:24,420
you know hear you talk about what your

3757
02:20:22,859 --> 02:20:27,000
hopes are

3758
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:29,460
um I appreciate that

3759
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:31,978
was there anything else you wanted to

3760
02:20:29,459 --> 02:20:33,478
mention about The Syndicate

3761
02:20:31,978 --> 02:20:36,119
um because otherwise I think we can kind

3762
02:20:33,478 --> 02:20:39,420
of move towards wrapping up with a few

3763
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:42,660
like uh lighter quicker questions I mean

3764
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:44,700
the The Syndicate like it's probably the

3765
02:20:42,659 --> 02:20:47,100
thing I when I have a pride of anything

3766
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:48,780
it may not be breeding but the fact that

3767
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:50,640
this is forming and that when I'm gone

3768
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:52,140
I'm hoping it'll still be here and

3769
02:20:50,639 --> 02:20:53,879
people will take the reins or if I

3770
02:20:52,139 --> 02:20:55,978
retire or whatever I'm hoping people

3771
02:20:53,879 --> 02:20:57,299
take the reins of it because these are

3772
02:20:55,978 --> 02:20:59,760
such beautiful people that have

3773
02:20:57,299 --> 02:21:01,978
assembled like

3774
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:04,559
it's just amazing and if I have any

3775
02:21:01,978 --> 02:21:05,938
Pride or anything it's going to be with

3776
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:08,818
that the people that have all come

3777
02:21:05,939 --> 02:21:10,200
together and that I had any part in that

3778
02:21:08,818 --> 02:21:13,199
whether it was just choosing the name

3779
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:15,600
and that you know or doing the show and

3780
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:17,220
if I had any part in that that's going

3781
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:19,859
to be my pride like I love the

3782
02:21:17,219 --> 02:21:23,039
bonnetwork and I love I love cannabis

3783
02:21:19,859 --> 02:21:26,040
and I love what I've done in it

3784
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:26,939
um I love this a lot and I'm more proud

3785
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:29,340
of

3786
02:21:26,939 --> 02:21:30,840
this because in cannabis everybody else

3787
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:32,700
I I just consider everything I've done

3788
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:36,000
everybody else's

3789
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:39,680
you should be proud it's really special

3790
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,680
thank you I appreciate it

3791
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:44,340
um

3792
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:46,260
yeah yeah it's I I'm you know I know

3793
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:48,000
again like I'm no one in in cannabis

3794
02:21:46,260 --> 02:21:51,478
world and don't have any aspirations of

3795
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:54,120
being anyone but again even as like just

3796
02:21:51,478 --> 02:21:57,539
an Enthusiast at home like it's been

3797
02:21:54,120 --> 02:22:00,060
such a special experience and yeah such

3798
02:21:57,540 --> 02:22:02,040
a special place you know the Discord

3799
02:22:00,059 --> 02:22:04,739
patreon is one of the things that were

3800
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:06,180
like early on I was like God I don't

3801
02:22:04,739 --> 02:22:07,379
want to charge people that was the one

3802
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:09,540
thing I did not want to do is charge

3803
02:22:07,379 --> 02:22:11,579
people for info and part of getting into

3804
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:13,080
the the Discord patreon is paying five

3805
02:22:11,579 --> 02:22:14,898
dollars to get in and I was really

3806
02:22:13,079 --> 02:22:17,579
resistant to it I hated the idea

3807
02:22:14,898 --> 02:22:19,439
absolutely hated the idea but when I

3808
02:22:17,579 --> 02:22:22,500
realized like

3809
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:24,960
if we do this we in order for it to

3810
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:28,318
succeed it has to get bigger right it

3811
02:22:24,959 --> 02:22:30,779
can't just be us and in order to do that

3812
02:22:28,318 --> 02:22:33,600
I'd have to bring in new people

3813
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:35,340
and if it if I felt like if I opened the

3814
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:37,739
flood gates five dollars would be enough

3815
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:39,659
of a barrier to keep out people who come

3816
02:22:37,739 --> 02:22:42,239
in just to fight

3817
02:22:39,659 --> 02:22:43,619
yeah and stuff like that and it was very

3818
02:22:42,239 --> 02:22:46,920
effective at it

3819
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:48,600
very very effective at it so while I

3820
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:50,700
regret

3821
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:53,818
having to charge anyone for anything on

3822
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:54,540
that level at the same time because of

3823
02:22:53,818 --> 02:22:57,299
that

3824
02:22:54,540 --> 02:23:00,000
it seems like everybody's happy to pay

3825
02:22:57,299 --> 02:23:02,519
that to keep the idiots out you know

3826
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,920
what I mean like so it did work it's

3827
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:06,659
effective uh as far as keeping trolls

3828
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:09,239
out people people going there just to

3829
02:23:06,659 --> 02:23:11,219
cause problems and for a while we opened

3830
02:23:09,239 --> 02:23:15,180
it up for free

3831
02:23:11,219 --> 02:23:18,179
to see how it went right and that was

3832
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:20,159
fun it was interesting and we gained a

3833
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:22,260
lot of new people by doing that too that

3834
02:23:20,159 --> 02:23:23,939
are really passionate so yeah the

3835
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:26,280
Discord has been a great place for

3836
02:23:23,939 --> 02:23:29,579
everyone to kind of like commune find

3837
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:32,040
each other and really start digging into

3838
02:23:29,579 --> 02:23:34,079
history in ways that I think they

3839
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:35,340
probably never have and and I really

3840
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:37,260
feel in ways that have never been

3841
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:39,059
offered for cannabis Community ever and

3842
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:41,760
I've been a part of most of them

3843
02:23:39,059 --> 02:23:44,398
yeah and and for me you know in in this

3844
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:46,439
conversation today what I love is that

3845
02:23:44,398 --> 02:23:47,760
in many ways we've come full circle like

3846
02:23:46,439 --> 02:23:49,979
you

3847
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:52,978
you started with the community Spirit

3848
02:23:49,978 --> 02:23:54,779
yeah and we are still there with the

3849
02:23:52,978 --> 02:23:57,119
Syndicate you've carried that on really

3850
02:23:54,780 --> 02:23:58,680
strongly and of course it was great of

3851
02:23:57,120 --> 02:24:01,740
course to hear all your breeding work

3852
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:04,500
but it's so cool to hear about this side

3853
02:24:01,739 --> 02:24:06,239
of things the community side because I

3854
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:08,818
don't know if I've encountered another

3855
02:24:06,239 --> 02:24:12,119
figure in this scene who is as Community

3856
02:24:08,818 --> 02:24:15,119
minded as you and it makes it so ironic

3857
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:16,920
uh it makes those controversies so

3858
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:19,680
ironic yeah

3859
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:21,840
um in that context you know I and you

3860
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:23,340
know what's funny is like there are a

3861
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:26,040
lot of people who have joined over the

3862
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:28,079
years and I've learned like when I when

3863
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:30,180
these people like hit me up in DMS and

3864
02:24:28,079 --> 02:24:31,318
are like nasty and ugly to me I just

3865
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:32,760
usually say I'll see you in three years

3866
02:24:31,318 --> 02:24:33,659
bro if you're still around I'll see you

3867
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:35,939
in three years

3868
02:24:33,659 --> 02:24:38,340
and without it without fail dude I've

3869
02:24:35,939 --> 02:24:40,859
gotten so many messages like bro I am

3870
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:42,478
sorry you're right like because usually

3871
02:24:40,859 --> 02:24:43,680
if I say that I go through the [ __ ] and

3872
02:24:42,478 --> 02:24:45,840
I see they're working with a scammer and

3873
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:47,040
I'm like hey man I'll tell you what in

3874
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:48,359
three years you're gonna find out this

3875
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:50,160
dude's a scammer You're Gonna Know It

3876
02:24:48,359 --> 02:24:52,140
And when you do will you come back to me

3877
02:24:50,159 --> 02:24:54,959
or you know station like that almost

3878
02:24:52,139 --> 02:24:56,939
without fail it works every time so a

3879
02:24:54,959 --> 02:24:59,459
lot of people get it over time what the

3880
02:24:56,939 --> 02:25:01,559
with the propaganda pushback was and why

3881
02:24:59,459 --> 02:25:04,379
it happened and

3882
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:06,420
you know like realistically like my

3883
02:25:04,379 --> 02:25:08,519
mission in life isn't just to make The

3884
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:10,079
Syndicate it was to get misinformation

3885
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:11,819
out of cannabis and the only way to do

3886
02:25:10,079 --> 02:25:13,920
that is to hold people's feet to the

3887
02:25:11,818 --> 02:25:15,539
fire and by doing that I did that to

3888
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:19,260
individual people

3889
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:22,080
over a period of 17 years now

3890
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:24,300
and I've amassed an army of people that

3891
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:25,500
[ __ ] hate my guts and this is true

3892
02:25:24,299 --> 02:25:27,659
and like people in The Syndicate have

3893
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:31,200
actually watched this happen many times

3894
02:25:27,659 --> 02:25:34,619
over now cycle these people pop up mix

3895
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:36,000
it up and fight you know and in I've

3896
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:38,760
learned to deal with it a lot better I

3897
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:40,500
think you know because I mean it helps

3898
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:42,300
when there's more people than just me to

3899
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:43,318
witness the the craziness because for a

3900
02:25:42,299 --> 02:25:45,119
long time

3901
02:25:43,318 --> 02:25:47,279
yeah there wasn't anybody but more than

3902
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:49,020
me because people are terrified to

3903
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:50,340
associate with me they would people

3904
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:51,600
would harass friends of mine that

3905
02:25:50,340 --> 02:25:54,059
weren't even breeders they would just

3906
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:56,939
rash them you know yeah you couldn't

3907
02:25:54,059 --> 02:25:58,920
even you could not post and grow Riot

3908
02:25:56,939 --> 02:26:01,079
seed stuff on forums because people

3909
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:02,280
would harass you off the forums get like

3910
02:26:01,079 --> 02:26:04,020
every time

3911
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:05,460
people had nothing to do with me would

3912
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:08,159
get harassed for growing my [ __ ] and

3913
02:26:05,459 --> 02:26:10,259
showing it so

3914
02:26:08,159 --> 02:26:12,539
time to change we've got you back a bit

3915
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:13,920
I know it's it's weird it is very weird

3916
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:15,960
to have

3917
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:17,760
like I mean you see it when I get sick I

3918
02:26:15,959 --> 02:26:19,679
feel like I'm like I've got to [ __ ]

3919
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:21,478
get back to it but it's hard to remember

3920
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:23,939
that there's other people that like care

3921
02:26:21,478 --> 02:26:27,059
as much as I do now that can run with it

3922
02:26:23,939 --> 02:26:30,059
and can carry balls you know

3923
02:26:27,059 --> 02:26:32,699
that sounds good what I mean really cool

3924
02:26:30,059 --> 02:26:34,379
no yeah I love it [ __ ] love it

3925
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:37,740
okay well thank you for that that was

3926
02:26:34,379 --> 02:26:40,799
yeah super special and um we kind of

3927
02:26:37,739 --> 02:26:42,239
like to me we've kind of covered the

3928
02:26:40,799 --> 02:26:44,219
bulk of like the critical questions that

3929
02:26:42,239 --> 02:26:46,139
I wanted to ask sure I would say that

3930
02:26:44,219 --> 02:26:49,260
like I've maybe got another 20 to 30

3931
02:26:46,139 --> 02:26:51,119
minutes tops yeah and um I've got a few

3932
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:52,859
Community questions that kind of didn't

3933
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:54,120
necessarily fit anywhere but they're

3934
02:26:52,859 --> 02:26:55,559
still pretty cool perfect let's nail

3935
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:57,540
them

3936
02:26:55,559 --> 02:27:00,000
um so one is one that I had for you

3937
02:26:57,540 --> 02:27:03,180
which is you know I've said this to you

3938
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:04,799
in private that like I think part of the

3939
02:27:03,180 --> 02:27:05,818
direction change that you've experienced

3940
02:27:04,799 --> 02:27:07,259
last couple of years you're actually

3941
02:27:05,818 --> 02:27:09,359
becoming more and more of like an

3942
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:10,859
archivist journalist type I know you

3943
02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:13,318
don't you wouldn't maybe consider that

3944
02:27:10,859 --> 02:27:14,579
yourself but I do yeah a poor man's

3945
02:27:13,318 --> 02:27:16,260
version

3946
02:27:14,579 --> 02:27:18,239
and I guess in terms of like the

3947
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:20,939
investigations you know are there any

3948
02:27:18,239 --> 02:27:22,739
other major lines or names that are

3949
02:27:20,939 --> 02:27:24,180
still kind of like at the back of your

3950
02:27:22,739 --> 02:27:26,100
mind they're like I want to get to the

3951
02:27:24,180 --> 02:27:28,139
bottom of that are there any you know

3952
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:29,579
there there's a few

3953
02:27:28,139 --> 02:27:32,099
um G13

3954
02:27:29,579 --> 02:27:34,978
only because I'm like

3955
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:37,200
5 6 of the way there and no bunch of it

3956
02:27:34,978 --> 02:27:39,478
but someone is secret squirreling the

3957
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:41,579
last part and

3958
02:27:39,478 --> 02:27:42,539
basically gatekeeping that info from

3959
02:27:41,579 --> 02:27:43,920
getting out

3960
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:46,260
interesting

3961
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:48,960
like he's just making shorts of some of

3962
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:51,120
the hash plant discussions yeah it's

3963
02:27:48,959 --> 02:27:53,179
basically like he went and talked to the

3964
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:55,140
guy

3965
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:56,818
and

3966
02:27:55,139 --> 02:27:58,079
no one's allowed to talk about what he

3967
02:27:56,818 --> 02:28:00,119
found

3968
02:27:58,079 --> 02:28:01,200
because he wants to one day maybe do

3969
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:03,600
something with it like a book or

3970
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:06,300
something maybe one day

3971
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:10,079
okay and I find that extremely selfish

3972
02:28:06,299 --> 02:28:12,420
and that is bizarre cowardly and just

3973
02:28:10,079 --> 02:28:17,700
like little [ __ ] [ __ ] but

3974
02:28:12,420 --> 02:28:20,219
um Romulan was a big one big one because

3975
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:23,100
there's so much myth around it and

3976
02:28:20,219 --> 02:28:25,379
trying to go and track down Romulan Joe

3977
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:27,659
there's so much myth around him that's

3978
02:28:25,379 --> 02:28:31,818
one that I've wanted to do

3979
02:28:27,659 --> 02:28:31,818
um maybe one day we'll see that

3980
02:28:31,859 --> 02:28:33,780
um

3981
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:36,060
you know what's interesting you

3982
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:38,700
mentioned archivists and stuff

3983
02:28:36,059 --> 02:28:40,859
um very recently one of my old close

3984
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:42,240
friends from like Junior High that was a

3985
02:28:40,859 --> 02:28:44,818
skater kid that was a skate and smoke

3986
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:45,478
pot together in junior high out but you

3987
02:28:44,818 --> 02:28:47,340
know

3988
02:28:45,478 --> 02:28:49,739
um he hit me up and he still smokes he's

3989
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:52,559
into strange stuff but he worked for

3990
02:28:49,739 --> 02:28:56,039
DreamWorks Studio as an archivist

3991
02:28:52,559 --> 02:28:57,719
and now works for a major university and

3992
02:28:56,040 --> 02:29:00,359
he's so good at his job that they he

3993
02:28:57,719 --> 02:29:02,039
gets paid sabbaticals for two or three

3994
02:29:00,359 --> 02:29:03,780
months during summer to go archive

3995
02:29:02,040 --> 02:29:06,960
whatever he wants

3996
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:08,939
wow and to do serious stuff and this

3997
02:29:06,959 --> 02:29:10,379
stuff in his stuff is presented at the

3998
02:29:08,939 --> 02:29:12,898
Library of Congress and these big

3999
02:29:10,379 --> 02:29:14,759
displays and museums and [ __ ] yeah so

4000
02:29:12,898 --> 02:29:16,920
it's serious stuff and he wants to do

4001
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:18,898
one on the history of punk rock and

4002
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:22,200
Bakersfield when I was a big figure in

4003
02:29:18,898 --> 02:29:25,079
that oh my God and he wants to cover

4004
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:26,700
cannabis maybe eventually and like to

4005
02:29:25,079 --> 02:29:28,620
get like the Cannabis history covered

4006
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:32,240
and displayed in the Library of Congress

4007
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:34,380
that would be so huge to me

4008
02:29:32,239 --> 02:29:36,539
and it wouldn't be my work it would be

4009
02:29:34,379 --> 02:29:38,398
because he's a real archivist and

4010
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:40,680
Anthropologist and does this real but

4011
02:29:38,398 --> 02:29:41,818
like to be even a part of that

4012
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:43,859
yeah

4013
02:29:41,818 --> 02:29:46,978
yeah I mean he's gonna need people like

4014
02:29:43,859 --> 02:29:49,859
you yeah that's why he reached out like

4015
02:29:46,978 --> 02:29:53,039
yeah it was phenomenal I like he's gone

4016
02:29:49,859 --> 02:29:55,020
so far in life it's crazy that's juicy

4017
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:57,560
all right that's my first time hearing

4018
02:29:55,020 --> 02:29:57,560
that yeah

4019
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:03,719
all right well next question from PBJ

4020
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:05,159
girl okay what is something that you

4021
02:30:03,719 --> 02:30:08,219
wish you knew before you started

4022
02:30:05,159 --> 02:30:12,659
breeding looking back oh God it would be

4023
02:30:08,219 --> 02:30:15,119
um first not to be so aggressive with

4024
02:30:12,659 --> 02:30:18,119
pulling in front of people

4025
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:19,800
secondly the name drop thing from Caleb

4026
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:21,899
CSI

4027
02:30:19,799 --> 02:30:23,159
don't name drop people when you first

4028
02:30:21,898 --> 02:30:24,358
meet people

4029
02:30:23,159 --> 02:30:25,619
because you never know what their

4030
02:30:24,359 --> 02:30:27,920
feelings are truly going to be about

4031
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:27,920
them

4032
02:30:28,318 --> 02:30:32,519
um I would I would have learned about

4033
02:30:30,719 --> 02:30:33,840
the Spanish bait and switch earlier that

4034
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:35,159
everything you're buying I'm sorry yeah

4035
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:37,020
everything you're buying from Amsterdam

4036
02:30:35,159 --> 02:30:40,219
comes from Spain and that's probably not

4037
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:40,220
going to be what's on the packs

4038
02:30:40,260 --> 02:30:43,620
and

4039
02:30:41,818 --> 02:30:45,019
um generally speaking people are [ __ ]

4040
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:48,780
Liars

4041
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:50,880
like plants not the people yeah yeah be

4042
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:53,100
critical critical thinking critical

4043
02:30:50,879 --> 02:30:56,159
thinking critical thinking confront your

4044
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:57,239
own biases critical thinking

4045
02:30:56,159 --> 02:31:00,119
yeah

4046
02:30:57,239 --> 02:31:01,978
nice no it's a great answer yeah okay

4047
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:03,420
another good one from PBJ girl a little

4048
02:31:01,978 --> 02:31:07,079
bit more personal

4049
02:31:03,420 --> 02:31:08,520
if you weren't a musician and you

4050
02:31:07,079 --> 02:31:10,439
weren't a breeder what do you think

4051
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:14,280
you'd end up doing in an alternate

4052
02:31:10,439 --> 02:31:16,620
universe so my my in Canada or in in

4053
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:18,300
high school I wanted to brew beer for a

4054
02:31:16,620 --> 02:31:20,479
living which I don't feel I'm too far

4055
02:31:18,299 --> 02:31:23,039
off like yeah

4056
02:31:20,478 --> 02:31:25,438
even in the same yeah even in the same

4057
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:27,060
family of plants but I wanted to bring

4058
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:28,439
here for a living

4059
02:31:27,059 --> 02:31:30,299
um art probably would be another one

4060
02:31:28,439 --> 02:31:32,040
even though I suck at Art I wish I was

4061
02:31:30,299 --> 02:31:33,779
better

4062
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:36,420
um I I thought I was gonna be a musician

4063
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:38,159
growing up but I'm not you know like

4064
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:39,960
professionally

4065
02:31:38,159 --> 02:31:42,180
um I don't know that I would love that

4066
02:31:39,959 --> 02:31:44,699
life after watching a bunch of my

4067
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:47,398
friends friends that live that life

4068
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:49,740
um try to succeed only if you have like

4069
02:31:47,398 --> 02:31:51,539
majorly succeeded and it's hard it's

4070
02:31:49,739 --> 02:31:53,699
hard on them it's a hard life you're

4071
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:55,140
traveling constantly

4072
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:56,819
yeah

4073
02:31:55,139 --> 02:31:58,920
um

4074
02:31:56,818 --> 02:32:00,779
I'm not I don't know I'm not good at

4075
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:03,780
much like when people say that it's like

4076
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:05,880
oh no I'm really not like I don't

4077
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:08,700
I like reading a lot you know I have my

4078
02:32:05,879 --> 02:32:09,898
UFO stuff that I do like I don't I talk

4079
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:12,000
about sometimes on the show and I even

4080
02:32:09,898 --> 02:32:15,000
had a podcast for a bit but like as much

4081
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:17,939
as I archive in cannabis I probably have

4082
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:20,818
archived three times as much in ufology

4083
02:32:17,939 --> 02:32:23,460
and have studied it more than cannabis

4084
02:32:20,818 --> 02:32:25,739
so that was always my main Obsession up

4085
02:32:23,459 --> 02:32:28,799
until the even the past few years that

4086
02:32:25,739 --> 02:32:30,299
I've decided I'm done with ufology

4087
02:32:28,799 --> 02:32:32,579
but I can see that it comes from the

4088
02:32:30,299 --> 02:32:34,739
same place right oh yeah yeah oh yeah

4089
02:32:32,579 --> 02:32:36,898
and dude the same character type of

4090
02:32:34,739 --> 02:32:38,520
characters show up in ufology like it's

4091
02:32:36,898 --> 02:32:40,139
crazy like they even look like the

4092
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:41,460
person they sound like the person and

4093
02:32:40,139 --> 02:32:43,799
they act like the person but they have a

4094
02:32:41,459 --> 02:32:46,978
different names and it's [ __ ] it's

4095
02:32:43,799 --> 02:32:50,099
[ __ ] up so [ __ ] up I guess like in

4096
02:32:46,978 --> 02:32:53,340
these kind of like marginal like opaque

4097
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:55,200
uh worlds of like weird like uncertain

4098
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:58,620
information you might get some of the

4099
02:32:55,200 --> 02:33:01,319
same programs it is crazy they even look

4100
02:32:58,620 --> 02:33:03,060
the same it's so weird

4101
02:33:01,318 --> 02:33:05,340
so weird okay

4102
02:33:03,059 --> 02:33:07,079
well I have a final question and it's

4103
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:07,920
kind of like

4104
02:33:07,079 --> 02:33:09,659
um

4105
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:12,239
one of those like fantasy breeding

4106
02:33:09,659 --> 02:33:14,939
questions I I I it's from hippie stick

4107
02:33:12,239 --> 02:33:16,500
and he said okay oh sorry I they I don't

4108
02:33:14,939 --> 02:33:19,020
I don't actually know I'd like to know

4109
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:20,398
what your Ultimate Fantasy breeding

4110
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:22,319
project would look like if you had

4111
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:24,539
access to any Cairo sweet line from

4112
02:33:22,318 --> 02:33:26,100
anywhere or anyone through cannabis

4113
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:27,840
history and maybe because you've already

4114
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:29,640
kind of spoken about

4115
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:31,859
the potential of blueberry maybe we just

4116
02:33:29,639 --> 02:33:34,500
exclude blueberry entirely from this

4117
02:33:31,859 --> 02:33:36,300
from this like hypothetical project yeah

4118
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:38,700
where would you go what would you do I

4119
02:33:36,299 --> 02:33:40,019
if I had the chance to go back in

4120
02:33:38,700 --> 02:33:43,020
history

4121
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:44,640
I would work with my old friend Neville

4122
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:47,220
and

4123
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:48,659
I would find out what Afghan T was

4124
02:33:47,219 --> 02:33:49,978
and I would see if I was right about

4125
02:33:48,659 --> 02:33:51,898
super skunk

4126
02:33:49,978 --> 02:33:54,719
it would be to to settle the question on

4127
02:33:51,898 --> 02:33:55,920
super skunk is it is the is the Afghan

4128
02:33:54,719 --> 02:33:58,318
tea

4129
02:33:55,920 --> 02:34:00,000
just the best skunkiest representation

4130
02:33:58,318 --> 02:34:02,939
of super Stockton is that what we're

4131
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:04,920
finding in the jesel Kim D stuff like

4132
02:34:02,939 --> 02:34:07,859
that is all Afghan T representations and

4133
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:09,600
I think it is I'm pretty sure

4134
02:34:07,859 --> 02:34:12,120
um but I'd like to know more that's one

4135
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:14,640
line one cut

4136
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:16,079
line even in the in what was called the

4137
02:34:14,639 --> 02:34:17,760
maple leaf Indica that I would like to

4138
02:34:16,079 --> 02:34:20,459
find more out about

4139
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:23,040
for sure for sure yeah

4140
02:34:20,459 --> 02:34:25,199
it keeps me up at night

4141
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:27,300
I love that because instead of like

4142
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:29,640
choosing something to actually like like

4143
02:34:27,299 --> 02:34:31,500
work with or work within a new way

4144
02:34:29,639 --> 02:34:33,599
you've chosen to be like no I want to

4145
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:35,520
confirm information yeah it's just

4146
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:38,220
confirming data like data points that I

4147
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:40,500
have I've it's like to me it's the

4148
02:34:38,219 --> 02:34:42,599
equivalent of like is there life on

4149
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:45,059
other worlds or

4150
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:47,460
um you know did Jesus exist or you know

4151
02:34:45,059 --> 02:34:49,978
anyone does it's like mythical did I get

4152
02:34:47,459 --> 02:34:52,259
super skunk right am I right

4153
02:34:49,978 --> 02:34:54,898
about this it's one of my life like it

4154
02:34:52,260 --> 02:34:57,780
keeps me up at night me and not so have

4155
02:34:54,898 --> 02:35:02,099
spent more hours on the phone and online

4156
02:34:57,780 --> 02:35:04,680
talking about this one single thing than

4157
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:07,439
anything else like I count days worth of

4158
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:09,659
hours talking about this [ __ ] months

4159
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:12,120
worth of hours so it's one of those

4160
02:35:09,659 --> 02:35:14,459
things like with breeding projects like

4161
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:16,079
I didn't really think like I think I

4162
02:35:14,459 --> 02:35:18,659
could pretty much Source whatever I need

4163
02:35:16,079 --> 02:35:20,760
to make whatever Turf I want or need in

4164
02:35:18,659 --> 02:35:22,260
cannabis like if I really set my mind to

4165
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:25,020
it and had the years and the time and

4166
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:25,680
finances I could probably do it now

4167
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:28,560
um

4168
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:31,260
but finding out what something was

4169
02:35:28,559 --> 02:35:32,818
that's missing from history

4170
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:34,200
that's a lot harder that's more

4171
02:35:32,818 --> 02:35:36,779
challenging and I think I got this one

4172
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:38,640
right I think I do and I'm not usually

4173
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:41,220
that confident about stuff but I am I'm

4174
02:35:38,639 --> 02:35:42,420
pretty confident on this and if I'm

4175
02:35:41,219 --> 02:35:43,500
right about this it means a lot of

4176
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:45,960
people lied

4177
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:47,939
and I can correct a lot of stuff

4178
02:35:45,959 --> 02:35:51,179
yeah

4179
02:35:47,939 --> 02:35:52,020
no yes that's a great question

4180
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:53,818
um

4181
02:35:52,020 --> 02:35:55,620
those are the questions I've got for you

4182
02:35:53,818 --> 02:35:58,318
today Matt

4183
02:35:55,620 --> 02:36:00,359
okay that's good I mean like I think

4184
02:35:58,318 --> 02:36:01,680
this is an excellent even part one if

4185
02:36:00,359 --> 02:36:04,380
anybody else wants to go back and touch

4186
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:07,079
on stuff this is thorough as [ __ ]

4187
02:36:04,379 --> 02:36:08,938
I'm glad I'm glad and you know again

4188
02:36:07,079 --> 02:36:10,500
thank you for the opportunity and thank

4189
02:36:08,939 --> 02:36:11,760
you for like all this stuff that you've

4190
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:13,739
done like

4191
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:15,840
I know like I don't represent anyone in

4192
02:36:13,739 --> 02:36:17,939
saying that but in in a way I do I know

4193
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:19,620
that many other people are grateful for

4194
02:36:17,939 --> 02:36:21,840
so much of this so much of The Syndicate

4195
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:23,840
so much of the work that you've done

4196
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:23,840
um

4197
02:36:24,239 --> 02:36:29,760
it's it's still at this moment right now

4198
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:31,500
absolutely bizarre to me that I just got

4199
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:32,659
to do this conversation with you in this

4200
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:35,459
interview with you

4201
02:36:32,659 --> 02:36:37,920
but I think it also the fact that I am

4202
02:36:35,459 --> 02:36:39,299
here talking to you like this I think

4203
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:43,859
also

4204
02:36:39,299 --> 02:36:45,840
in a way uh embodies this that Community

4205
02:36:43,859 --> 02:36:47,520
Spirit of yours were you like so anyone

4206
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:49,920
can have the chance

4207
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:51,239
to do this yeah right and I think we're

4208
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:52,439
interviewing me doesn't feel very

4209
02:36:51,239 --> 02:36:53,579
special to me

4210
02:36:52,439 --> 02:36:56,159
um like it doesn't feel like a special

4211
02:36:53,579 --> 02:36:57,659
event but I felt like

4212
02:36:56,159 --> 02:37:00,539
I felt like your questions are really

4213
02:36:57,659 --> 02:37:02,039
good I like how you speak and like

4214
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:04,920
realistically

4215
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:07,439
I I just I never really

4216
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:09,000
felt the need to interview me ever again

4217
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:10,620
like I've never done it on the show you

4218
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:13,260
never everybody my interviews on the

4219
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:15,000
show like that but I just I felt like I

4220
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:16,620
didn't need to do it and I felt like it

4221
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,620
it would be bad

4222
02:37:16,620 --> 02:37:21,240
for me to do no and you were the only

4223
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:23,399
one that really really took the reins

4224
02:37:21,239 --> 02:37:26,459
and really made it happen

4225
02:37:23,398 --> 02:37:28,559
so thank you for doing that

4226
02:37:26,459 --> 02:37:30,898
no you're so welcome

4227
02:37:28,559 --> 02:37:33,299
um and you know going back to those

4228
02:37:30,898 --> 02:37:35,639
feelings of like uh do I really want an

4229
02:37:33,299 --> 02:37:36,539
interview of myself like I I think it

4230
02:37:35,639 --> 02:37:38,639
goes back to something we were talking

4231
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:41,220
about earlier which is that like

4232
02:37:38,639 --> 02:37:43,559
at a point this becomes bigger than you

4233
02:37:41,219 --> 02:37:45,659
yeah you know and in a way it's

4234
02:37:43,559 --> 02:37:48,420
it's bigger than your feelings about

4235
02:37:45,659 --> 02:37:49,978
yourself yeah you know and I know that

4236
02:37:48,420 --> 02:37:51,239
that's really hard sometimes to actually

4237
02:37:49,978 --> 02:37:53,279
stomach but

4238
02:37:51,239 --> 02:37:55,879
yeah it is now I'm gonna force you to

4239
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,880
edit this just

4240
02:37:58,559 --> 02:38:02,039
well yeah I don't know I don't know how

4241
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:04,859
to wrap this up but you know I think

4242
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:07,740

4243
02:38:04,859 --> 02:38:09,420

forever that we're friends with this

4251

Mission isn't about the best grower this

4252
02:38:25,859 --> 02:38:29,220
Mission isn't about who knows genetics

the best or who can speak the best with

4254

4255
02:38:31,799 --> 02:38:34,500

4257
