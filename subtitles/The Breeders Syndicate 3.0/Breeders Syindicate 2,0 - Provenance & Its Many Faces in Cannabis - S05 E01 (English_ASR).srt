scene through the eyes of the folks who

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,320
lived it i'm matthew owner of riot seeds

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,719

welcome to the underground

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,678
how's your friday night so far

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
that's all right

12
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,920
was uh there a wide variety of color

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,960
schemes to pick from from your uh

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,439
earmuffs no no there's not no it was

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,160
just uh periwinkle and yellow was your

16
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,959
only option this is it this is what we

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,038
get that was it this is what we get i

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,120
mean when i guess it's extra extra small

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
they have limited colors i know we need

20
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,640
to get you one so that when you do your

21
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,799
audio it won't bleed in and it'll be

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
easier to yeah

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,519
you know when they say one size fits

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,478
most yes they throw in that disclaimer

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,640
for my head yeah yeah i bet i bet they

26
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,599
do they do you can watch like a ball cap

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,599
just like creep up

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
let me see if i can get some lighting

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,519
going on in this piece oh that's a

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,159
little better maybe

31
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,319
yeah there you go there we go

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,359
i can see your your shiny glow from

33
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,118
being pregnant indeed yep it's all the

34
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,319
estrogen i'm taking

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:31,438
yeah that yeah that helps yeah it does

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,438
it helps the transition

37
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,519
all right so tonight

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
we were going to get started talking

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,280
about

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,920
provenance in its place in cannabis in

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,960
the history why it's important now

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,478
um

43
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,719
it and even more so now than ever

44
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,478
so if you want to get started i i don't

45
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,399
know if you remember where we kind of

46
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,519
talked about starting off but kick it

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,000
off

48
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,759
yeah so i mean there's kind of like

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,078
probably what we'll end up doing is is

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,879
talking some like historical examples of

51
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,438
it

52
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,640
um from the beginning to like now

53
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,758
because there's a lot of it that's

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,840
relevant right now actually yeah um and

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,080
then just kind of like what we need as

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
far as ethics and stuff like that

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,360
yeah so the two paycheck you know like

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,520
uh both the hair and the beard are

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
completely unchanged from last week i

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,599
did zero uh time in the chair before i

61
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,439
started so

62
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,280
everyone can see me get progressively

63
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,680
shaggier

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,719
more aged as time goes on

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,159
yeah that's for sure

66
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,039
you know so

67
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,280
there you go that there we go um you

68
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,959
know so uh

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,080
you know there's an aspect now where

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
like

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
i guess it's it's sort of like why do

72
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,479
you care

73
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,680
yeah

74
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,840
and people i get that a lot people care

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,719
people care for different reasons

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,560
right

77
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:59,519
um you know the smallest minority uh of

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,039
us which i'd say matt and myself and csi

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,280
and some others are in

80
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,400
is the one that care because it's the

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,479
truth

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
and because we're like weed history

83
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,518
nerds and we want to actually know the

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,158
story

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,039
of how it came to be yeah

86
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,519
right

87
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,479
um but there's a lot of people that only

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
care

89
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:23,919
uh relative to how it helps them

90
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,280
yes right and in some cases you know um

91
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,839
you know when you interview some of the

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,080
original people that have like the stuff

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,680
you're so desperately after

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,760
they have that view too yeah they they

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
know it but they kind of only care about

96
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,639
it

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,360
in a way that it helps them

98
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,359
or how can it help me now

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
yeah right and so a lot of times what

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,599
happens is like you know you start to

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,159
talk to some of these people and like

102
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,919
memories are kind of hazy

103
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,359
and then as they get an idea about what

104
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,958
could happen with it well then they get

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
more specific

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,519
yeah you know and

107
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,239
um most of it is oral and most and some

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,879
of it is a lot of it is argued over

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,039
so it becomes really hard because it's

110
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,158
there's not a lot of proof

111
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,000
yeah

112
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,039
right so

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,199
uh

114
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,639
we've chatted about this on previous

115
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,399
casts but

116
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,560
you know when we were talking about like

117
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,120
the ron parties and stuff like that 20

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,720
years ago where i met caleb and fletch

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,439
and a bunch of different people

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,280
yeah i was hunting for old things then

121
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,719
yeah and it was hard uh in the last five

122
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,719
or six years

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
all of a sudden there's been a huge push

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,680
towards like well what was those 80s and

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,479
90s genetics like yeah and all of a

126
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
sudden they're everywhere

127
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,240
right

128
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,759
they're absolutely everywhere

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,759
right so you have this situation where

130
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,960
you know it doesn't take much all it

131
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,080
takes is one scammer to have you know 74

132
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,000
colombian or whatever yeah and it's not

133
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,918
actually that and it gets passed through

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
some good hands and it's almost like

135
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,799
bitcoin washing or something it gets

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,279
like

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,840
it gets its reputation gets verified

138
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,679
through others yes and so there's a lot

139
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,879
of aspects of that of how that works

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,720
you know so

141
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,759
um it's kind of a conversation that like

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,639
could go

143
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
uh

144
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,918
any number of different ways yeah uh but

145
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,038
maybe i'll start in the beginning

146
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,038
which is

147
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,959
i remember reading

148
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:31,038
uh stuff that uh sam skunk man wrote

149
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,198
about how pissed off him and rob clark

150
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,120
were in the early 80s that like five

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,600
percent of growers gave a [ __ ] about

152
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,280
genetics yeah five percent would be

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,840
massive now

154
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,559
massive and so there's an aspect where

155
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,159
it's like same as it ever was yeah right

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
like that's what we're about to chat

157
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
about and they were bitching about it in

158
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,120
1982 yeah

159
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,600
um because and i don't even think that's

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,759
wrong necessarily uh there's a lot of

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
people like i live in mendocino county

162
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,840
obviously so it's kind of weedland and

163
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,280
it's been going through some seismic

164
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,519
shocks lately

165
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,519
right as far as all that goes and you

166
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,959
really start to see the people

167
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,959
that um

168
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,719
are in it for it

169
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,439
and we're in it for spending cash or

170
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,360
we're in it for ease or whatever you

171
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,360
know like a lot of people were into weed

172
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
because weed i mean matt's seen this

173
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
with the seed game yeah from when he

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
started to now

175
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,918
right i mean how many big influx and

176
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,680
then a big outflux and right now i mean

177
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,279
people dropping like flies out of the

178
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
scene you know people that we thought

179
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,839
would probably be around you know no

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600
matter what i was kind of shocked you

181
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,439
know it happened though

182
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
well i mean some of it is some of it is

183
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,120
breeding is a pain in the ass too you

184
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,839
know and so it's like it's like maybe a

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,720
band maybe it has a a one to five year

186
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,719
life for most of them yeah you know it's

187
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,919
really hard to make a 20 or 30 year

188
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,919
career

189
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,758
out of breeding yeah and not being able

190
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,000
to go anywhere not being able to take

191
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
vacations all that comes if you take

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,399
reading very seriously and collecting

193
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,960
very seriously provenance all that that

194
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,038
you can say goodbye to all that uh well

195
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,279
on top of that too it's like for if you

196
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,279
if you compare it to music

197
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,799
having a being a one hit wonder means

198
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,879
you're more successful than most

199
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,639
musicians yeah because you still had the

200
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,000
right kid and then

201
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,478
because you had the one hit and then if

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,038
you have like a period of dominance for

203
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:25,439
like five years or something

204
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,839
that's pretty incredible yeah and the

205
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,439
number of bands that stay relevant over

206
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:35,359
15 or 20 years even is a tiny fraction

207
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,279
of everyone famous yeah yep so imagine

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,439
you have some huge hits

209
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,799
for breeding and then five or ten years

210
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,560
later what are you doing and then five

211
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,360
years later what are you doing

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,839
can you keep making hits can you keep

213
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,560
yourself relevant

214
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,198
it goes into it i i you know what i've

215
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,280
seen very few um seed makers be able to

216
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,840
keep themselves relevant unless they had

217
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,239
like a big marketing budget you know and

218
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,318
high times ads other than that it's it's

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,598
always an up and down battle for most

220
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,960
people

221
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,639
um

222
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,478
and so you know there's a there's an

223
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,400
aspect too where

224
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,680
um

225
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,359
i don't even know how to put it like

226
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,519
that but

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,360
that's what happens when i read comments

228
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,159
you know i can get totally thrown off

229
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,960
track

230
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
but

231
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,918
um

232
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,159
you know there's there's a thing now

233
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,519
like if we if we go from from what sam

234
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,960
said to now

235
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,719
now all of a sudden it's important to

236
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,560
have old cuts because people are trying

237
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
to differentiate themselves on the legal

238
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,240
market

239
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,958
there's a ton of new smokers who are

240
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,399
interested in these legendary things

241
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,478
yeah right

242
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,799
um and therefore there's money to be

243
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,200
made and rep to be had

244
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,479
by having them yeah and yeah you know

245
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,399
one of the things matt will tell you

246
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,879
this too one of the main ways to be a

247
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,278
breeder is let's say you end up being a

248
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,278
guy that's associated to a super famous

249
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,919
cut even if you weren't the breeder but

250
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,159
you were just somebody that got it early

251
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,879
most of those people have seed companies

252
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,519
yeah and they do they have a famous name

253
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,200
so they do breeding around what got them

254
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,959
there yeah

255
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,640
in the hopes that like

256
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,599
people that are interested in that would

257
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,559
want to get it from some og tied into

258
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
the

259
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,958
chem or the sour or the cookie what you

260
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,958
know whatever whatever it might be it's

261
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,079
ghettos or yeah whatever it might be

262
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,319
yeah whatever whatever whatev whatever

263
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,560
matt's background he has decided he is

264
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,640

have figurines but they all have big

269
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,240
dicks so he can't put them up and

270
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,440
they're all sent to me from matt yeah

271
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,278
you know i don't know if you've ever

272
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,680
been on the riot christmas list but

273
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,519
that's really all it is is like phallus

274
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,679
art it's the largest collection and i

275

276
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,359
that's you want to you want to avoid

277
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,879
getting on it yeah og and i'm not even

278
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,919
i'm not even dissing people but it's

279
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,759
like

280
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,599
by any means but yeah og like you know

281
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:06,879
norcal i see mag around around uh og kb

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,040
you know or cornbread ricky you know

283
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,958
around tk or

284
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,519
and anyone anyone then when you get

285
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,359
famous by it like a lot of people do

286
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,839
breeding sort of based around their

287
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,600
famous cuts

288
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,040
yeah right yeah

289
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,639
i mean

290
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,399
so then there's an aspect where it's

291
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,319
like one of the best ways to become a

292
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,919
breeder where people buy your seeds is

293
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,200
like claiming that you're associated

294
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,519
with [ __ ] yes yeah the big claim

295
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
the big claim and a lot of these claims

296
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,000
like it doesn't even matter if they get

297
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,079
refuted later on as long as they help

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you with your rise on the way up and

299
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,719
build your fan base

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,639
yeah

301
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,560
whether it's ancient skunks or this or

302
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,120
that's or whatever else it's like just

303
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,159
to get yourself known and on the map

304
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,200
yeah

305
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,759
you know

306
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,800
and you know so we'd weed was never

307
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,240
ready for modern marketing techniques so

308
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,719
you know we have this running joke in

309
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,959
our crew called the pre-pre

310
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,200
yes right yeah which is

311
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,000
all these strains that people have that

312
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,839
exist before the strain existed

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,159
yeah and you see this like we'll talk

314
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,519
we'll make jokes like oh we mentioned a

315
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,679
strain that probably hasn't been brought

316
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,159
up in 10 to 20 years publicly and

317
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,599
they'll be like [ __ ] [ __ ] in two weeks

318
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,039
we're gonna see it and then sure enough

319
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,120
two weeks later someone's like yeah i

320
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,919
got that cut and it's right here you

321
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,039
know

322
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,799
yeah the pre-pre it encompasses a lot

323
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,319
the pre-pre and like you know there's

324
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,319
we're not i'm not going to be big on

325
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,839
like like names or anything like that on

326
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,519
this particular episode it's more going

327
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,720
to be like actions and themes because

328
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
that's easier

329
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,920
yeah but

330
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,839
there's parts where it's like okay like

331
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,799
somebody's got oh i've got this thing

332
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:48,640
i've got 93 scentsy star yeah

333
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,879
but it got released in 95.

334
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
yeah you know or i've got 95 black

335
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,480
domina but dominant didn't get released

336
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,000
until the cup in 96 which is in november

337
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,240
so there's all these things where it's

338
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,679
like there's these cuts and they're like

339
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,600
they're like the earliest they could

340
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,120
possibly be and then a year or two

341
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
earlier

342
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,759
sometimes decades earlier yeah there's a

343
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,278
there's a 79 blueberry floating around

344
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,159
yeah yep

345
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,639
you know um when you know dj says that

346
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,799
he got his afghan to start the project i

347
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,399
think in 79. yeah

348
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,719
and then blueberry isn't blueberry like

349
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,799
an f4 f5 f4 yeah f4 yeah right so then

350
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,560
he did he did multiple generations and

351
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,120
testing and all that different stuff but

352
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,679
there's someone that has it that's his

353
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,200
from like before he you know the the

354
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,039
year that he started

355
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,040
the one i see the most is super skunk

356
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,559
that has like the most years around it

357
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,559
because nobody cares to look up when it

358
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,359
popped up yeah someone just said there's

359
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:48,638
a there's an 89 super skunk yeah exactly

360
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,600
it got released in the 90 catalog yeah

361
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,079
you know um sour was found a lot of

362
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,480
people think sour was found in 95. it

363
00:12:54,078 --> 00:13:00,399
wasn't it was found in 96.

364
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,399
uh the diesel 1 and 2 was found in 95.

365
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,200
but a lot of people sour it goes right

366
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,679
back to summer in

367
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
it's 95.

368
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,638
free the pre-cut before that pre-cut

369
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,879
there's because most people really when

370
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,600
it boils down to it it's like

371
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,439
it's almost like testing like has what

372
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,839
what's happened with thc testing where

373
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,760
it's like the

374
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,680
the lab knows that both the dispensary

375
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,399
and the grower want a high test because

376
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,879
that way everybody makes more money yeah

377
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,919
so the market knows that these earlier

378
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,919
dates

379
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,159
do well

380
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,479
and thus these earlier dates appear and

381
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,799
so we i've had this running joke that

382
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,480
like with the magic of a sharpie and a

383
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,759
label

384
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,278
ancient gems are unearthed all the time

385
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,439
yeah yeah

386
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,240
and i want them to be true and every

387
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,760
once in a while a few of them are true

388
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,720
yeah but

389
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,120
it's like it gets it gets earlier and

390
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,519
earlier and earlier and then you try to

391
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,919
refute it and it's like whack-a-mole

392
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,919
yeah you know and then and you know and

393
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,919
it's like so provenance

394
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,078
provenance with seeds is really hard

395
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,719
because they're just beans and they all

396
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,759
look fairly similar so it's like how the

397
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,079
how would you know if it's an 85

398
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,159
you know the best way to identify old

399
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,838
beans is they don't crack yeah they

400
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,679
don't crack very easily they don't or

401
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,279
they none of them pop

402
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,958
yeah or they're not viable and you're

403
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,559
like oh wow maybe these were really old

404
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,479
because they didn't none of them worked

405
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,078
yeah it's really frustrating because

406
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,399
they're only fresh for about five to

407
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,278
eight years yeah and that's stored

408
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,039
properly uh one summer in a bad closet

409
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,519
or in a hot garage

410
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,399
can dramatically lower their lifespan or

411
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,000
even kill all of them yeah definitely

412
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
you know and so now we're in this

413
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,919
situation where

414
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,320
i i i did i didn't shave this week for

415
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,958
street cred you can see all the gray uh

416
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,399
because all these 90 strains are coming

417
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,319
back around now

418
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,360
and most people didn't experience them

419
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,278
back then

420
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
yeah so therefore people can sell them

421
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,919
to you

422
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,480
and you have no personal experience

423
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,759
so would you like my 89 super skunk

424
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,519
would you like my 93 cent c star my 95

425
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,919
black domina my

426
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,720
you know my pre sam skunk that's another

427
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,120
favorite of mine yeah yeah

428
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,278
this is the this is the this is the sam

429
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,519
started in 75 this comes from before

430
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,278
then when it was still ranked or the pre

431
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,360
pre hayes brothers hayes the yeah

432
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,439
whatever whatever it might be going back

433
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,519
even way before i was like born

434
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,959
yeah and they still have stuff and

435
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,039
people that have been like secret and

436
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,078
doing and doing repros and stuff like

437
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,919
that and

438
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,799
every once in a while that stuff does

439
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,240
exist yeah it does happen it does happen

440
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,639
from time to time that someone comes out

441
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,720
with a legitimate i i have not been

442
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,039
online and i've been holding this this

443
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,120
exists it does happen so it's like we

444
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,879
don't want to rain on uh every parade

445
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,639
that pops up because we could be pushing

446
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,799
away good people well yeah you don't

447
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,720
want to be like there's this uh there's

448
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,078
there's this there's this funny like

449
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,199
from the welfare

450
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,719
feral era of uh of uh saturday night

451
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,559
live where like there's these two gay

452
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,240
kids that work in this clothing store

453
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,679
and no one's good enough to shop there

454
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,278
so everyone that comes in they just

455
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,078
insult them relentlessly until they

456
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,240
leave

457
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,000
yeah you know and so

458
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,919
you know you get tired because some of

459
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
it is obviously impossible right and

460
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,278
then they'll be like you call them out

461
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,440
on the pre-pre

462
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,480
yes and they'll be like oh well my buddy

463
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,639
got it directly from the breeder yeah

464
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,000
it might be pre-released but my buddy

465
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,480
got it yeah right or they just go along

466
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,559
and they just change on following posts

467
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,440
they just update the year to the

468
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,799
earliest year possible yeah and go along

469
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,120
with that new thing

470
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,599
yeah and those other posts get deleted

471
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,120
and they just adapt and move forward

472
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,720
and and when we were

473
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,639
talking about starting doing this

474
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
podcast together

475
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,919
one of the main things that me and natso

476
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,360
were talking about and we've talked

477
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,319
about this before but

478
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,839
um

479
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
are we doing a disservice to the

480
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,320
community by putting more info out there

481
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,240
that is accurate to the to the letter

482
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
when it comes to to know knowledge you

483
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,160
know because it's actually helping

484
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,919
people craft their stories more craftily

485
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,600
but luckily usually the people that do

486
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,280
that are so lazy they don't really they

487
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,359
leave holes all over so i think we're

488
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,038
good it leads to conundrums i mean

489
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,759
somebody was saying about

490
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,599
you know various you know the nl5 thing

491
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,038
i think i'm actually gonna do

492
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,599
uh a post on ig soon and like a little

493
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,519
like mini podcast talk on it that we

494
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,918
have planned just because most people

495
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,000
there are some real pictures of nl5 that

496
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,720
neville had but most people haven't seen

497
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,960
them

498
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,400
no you know and haven't put it together

499
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,960
and there are posts that neville made

500
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,960
where he talks specifically about it

501
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,279
uh and certain aspects of it and stuff

502
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480
like that um and most people haven't

503
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,079
seen that either

504
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
yeah right and so

505
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,079
you know there's a part where it's like

506
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,600
i'm such like an old weed nerd that like

507
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:58,000
every old story god i want it to be true

508
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,480
yeah yeah he does he really does you

509
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,640
want it to be true but the other part of

510
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
it that's really weird and maybe we'll

511
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,960
bring this up and it's kind of rambling

512
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,679
but

513
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,038
there's a lot of people on ig

514
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,440
uh this is going to be shocking that

515
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,558
like aren't the way they act on ig in

516
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,240
real life

517
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,399
yeah i know that's [ __ ] weird there's

518
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,558
a ton of people right and so there's a

519
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,679
whole group of people that find people

520
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,038
on ig

521
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,200
like me or others and be like i want

522
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,079
these cuts that i see this guy posting

523
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
about

524
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,720
yes what does he want

525
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,639
and then try to convince you that they

526
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,319
have it so that you can they can get

527
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
what you have

528
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,240
by trading you something you're after

529
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,120
yeah that's one thing when you're doing

530
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,359
trades please please be very you use

531
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,959
some critical thinking and and

532
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,199
if if you're looking for stuff that's

533
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,480
old or rare don't send someone a list of

534
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
your want list

535
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,759
because if they come back and send you

536
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,160
everything on your want list there's

537
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,558
probably red flags to be thrown if it's

538
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,120
old or rare and some people are really

539
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,079
good and generally speaking what happens

540
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:05,359
is if you get bamboozled out of cuts

541
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,359
or you get traded you trade you know old

542
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,479
rare [ __ ] you have that's awesome for

543
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,079
club cuts that they renamed most people

544
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,200
stay quiet about it because they don't

545
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,558
want to be embarrassed that they got

546
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,400
took advantage of

547
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,839
or they don't want to lose the monetary

548
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,679
value of what they just bought and want

549
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,519
to pass on the [ __ ] butt and

550
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,519
sometimes they end up breeding with it

551
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,720
for a few times before they realize what

552
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,200
it is and then they have a bunch of

553
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,240
seeds they made with it and so like

554
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,000
there's a lot in weed of like

555
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,400
you know a small percentage of people

556
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,440
know a bunch of stuff that's not public

557
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,160
yeah and it gets kept quiet

558
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,000
for for reasons like that yeah

559
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,000
you know um and you know and so and then

560
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,839
some what those scammers do

561
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,440
is then they use

562
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,519
i'm gonna make a post with a big picture

563
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,279
but yeah um that is nl5 that is that is

564
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,798
neville's mother that he used to make

565
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,440
nl5 haze

566
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:02,240
nl5 skunk one all that that's the only

567
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,360
nl5 cut he used in breeding

568
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,599
uh at scentsy in the last few years

569
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,279
um and so

570
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,359
you know but there's people that let's

571
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,879
say they once they once here i'm really

572
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,599
not going to name names but let's just

573
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,919
say

574
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,879
that you know they've managed to trade

575
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,559
with some well-regarded people yeah then

576
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,880
it makes it easier for them to trade

577
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,319
with others because some of that guys oh

578
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,760
he likes them and trades with them that

579
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,918
guy must be cool

580
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,798
it also gives gives

581
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,400
provenance seeming provenance to the cut

582
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,158
because now it's gone through someone

583
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,240
reputable and when it's not through

584
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,360
someone reputable's hands it adds that

585
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,519
stank

586
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,199
they they have they get two or three

587
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,879
people to buy into it and now all of a

588
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,360
sudden they got two or three well-known

589
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,520
people that they can trace real that now

590
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:51,199
they have really good cuts

591
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,960
mixed in with their club renames yeah

592
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,480
right because they can oh i got it from

593
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,519
this person and that person and you know

594
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,960
it's like and they got it from this

595
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,839
person and those people are all well

596
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,000
known

597
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,158
yeah and so that happens a lot like

598
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,919
there was a thing and we don't call it

599
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,000
that much anymore but like there used to

600
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,919
be a thing long before you could sell

601
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,679
clones and and not be ostracized

602
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,120
because 15 years ago that's certainly

603
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,798
what would have happened

604
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,279
um there was a thing that we used to

605
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,519
call trade baiting

606
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,678
right and trade baiting was basically

607
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,519
trading people to get a cut that you

608
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,759
thought would unlock a bunch of other

609
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,158
cuts for you yeah

610
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,000
like the chem d or you know various

611
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,400
different things people would would get

612
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,558
it promise to not give it out

613
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,360
and then use that to get 15 or 20

614
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,119
different things yeah

615
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,519
right and that's a lot of how like fakes

616
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,599
got spread because some people got cuts

617
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,679
only with the intention of using that to

618
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,279
unlock other things they wanted

619
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,280
yeah and that's how a lot of stuff

620
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,678
spreads people want stuff

621
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,480
yeah that's it's that want that need

622
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,320
that fomo yeah it's like adam smith like

623
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,599
the invisible hand people have a want

624
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,599
there's going to be an invisible hand

625
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,678
that brings the goods or services to

626
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,759
them yeah and there's people out there

627
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,440
that if they don't have that they'll

628
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,720
just say they have it

629
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,840
yeah because they want what's in your

630
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
pocket

631
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,519
yeah

632
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,279
you know um and so that's where you know

633
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,038
so now we have a bunch of

634
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,798
so when when old strains were unpopular

635
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,640
it was really really hard to find

636
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,480
anybody that would say oh i've got old

637
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,159
[ __ ]

638
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,558
because there wasn't any money in it

639
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,919
yeah now there's a bunch of money in it

640
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,440
they're everywhere

641
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,880
yeah

642
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,240
right

643
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,320
and so

644
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,558
you know and and

645
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,720
yeah seemingly you know and then stuff

646
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,480
gets awash and you've got oh i've got 89

647
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,000
this and and i've got this and i've got

648
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,360
that and i've got

649
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,279
you know and

650
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,959
and it gets laundered through a few

651
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,399
respectable people

652
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,240
and then some of those respectable

653
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,919
people breed with it a couple of times

654
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,079
and it's in their work

655
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,080
yeah and that's what makes provenance so

656
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,079
hard yeah

657
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,000
is everything comes out of the shadows

658
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,839
there's nothing really it's written down

659
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,798
it's nothing that's easily proved it's

660
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,519
all person-to-person honesty chain

661
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:07,279
so

662
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,720
maybe i'll use an example of something

663
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,839
that i consider to be like really good

664
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,079
provenance okay right so

665
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,079
you know greg pops what the dog which

666
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,319
became called the chem 91

667
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,359
okay he gives it to my buddy staten

668
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,359
island

669
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,359
okay statin gives him the skunk and

670
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,000
comes west

671
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,639
from that statin gives it to skunk va

672
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,279
myself and another friend

673
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
and we've all had it since yeah so it's

674
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,798
like a short chain

675
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,320
everybody agrees on both sides that it

676
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,000
happened

677
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,079
and then you don't lose it

678
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,319
yeah that's what we would call really

679
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,319
excellent providence yeah

680
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,278
you know like the people involved are

681
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,079
believable the time frame is believable

682
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:49,038
yeah

683
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,599
you know

684
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,359
um and and all that

685
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,678
uh and then we have stuff that's got

686
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,158
really bad prominence

687
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,360
yeah you know like uh something that

688
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,960
that matt and i have been trying to

689
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,319
figure out recently

690
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,720
is

691
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:10,399
does the actual cut of kush that matt

692
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,798
matt bubba and joe d and and uh josh did

693
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,240
that did does that still exist

694
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,079
yeah

695
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,880
you know um

696
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,119
the prominence on that one is hard

697
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,200
because they lost it

698
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:27,119
multiple times and it got renamed in la

699
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,000
and there's like half a dozen different

700
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,678
cuts that all claim to be it right yeah

701
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,119
if you have original ghosts they claim

702
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,759
that to be it

703
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,798
if you have original 92 og they they

704
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,599
consider that to be legit yeah right the

705
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:43,440
first sfv is supposed to be it

706
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,678
can you think of others

707
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,519
i i was just thinking of

708
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,519
something that makes the the chem 91

709
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,918
story a bit more complex because when

710
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,720
you have a situation where someone you

711
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,960
know has has a good reliable transaction

712
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,919
and we have reliable provenance getting

713
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,480
it to him

714
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,799
and then the next thing he passes out

715
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,960
like for example chem d

716
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,400
in a short period of time two people get

717
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,400
two different cuts

718
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,919
and no one can quite remember who got

719
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,919
which cut first but in such a short

720
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,679
period of time you can't really tell

721
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,320
which one would be considered the

722
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,159
original or not you know and at that

723
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,000
point it becomes

724
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,919
is an unreliable narrator always

725
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,839
unreliable or

726
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,799
can we just get it wrong once somebody

727
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:29,359
said sfv is it there's more than one sfv

728
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,119
cut that floats around yeah

729
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,199
after a seed line was released called

730
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,119
sfv there was no more

731
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,960
trying to dig up just sfv without

732
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,319
running into a thousand of them so

733
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,000
that's what i mean in the sense that

734
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,480
there's some things that are fairly well

735
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,519
agreed upon yeah but then there's a lot

736
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,919
where the provenance gets lost or murky

737
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,720
yeah and it's kind of and it's kind of

738
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,440
like and then in that case it's it you

739
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,278
know it suffers from renames the ghost

740
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,080
of right now isn't the ghost that was

741
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,519
getting traded 20 years ago yeah

742
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,639
it's not

743
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,558
yeah

744
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,880
you know um

745
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,399
and uh you know there's you know like

746
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,320
the eight you know there's people that

747
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,000
have the old ajs

748
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,480
yes sour diesel and there's people that

749
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,919
have the another aj's

750
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,679
sour diesel

751
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,038
i i keep trying to figure out if stony

752
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,679
puff and stuff in here is the stoney

753
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,839
puff and stuff from um overgrow and and

754
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,840
cannabis world and stuff well i guess

755
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,678
that's a good person for provenance for

756
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,519
the show i guess he could clear it

757
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,440
you know he could probably clear it up

758
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,839
yeah but yeah and so then it becomes two

759
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,000
it becomes like uh provenance that that

760
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,000
becomes like based on your trust or your

761
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,159
knowledge so it gets to be pretty small

762
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,798
circles that know what's very what's

763
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,278
verified yeah and i have people all the

764
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,720
time like in legal california there's an

765
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,759
aspect where

766
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,360
um

767
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,119
you know it's almost like all these

768
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,879
strains are like punk rock bands that

769
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,359
never signed with a label

770
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,039
yeah so nobody owns them

771
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,359
so there's this like multi-billion

772
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,119
dollar industry that's getting developed

773
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,199
and all these sharks are looking around

774
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,839
like nobody owns any of this [ __ ]

775
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,679
yeah nobody controls the rights to these

776
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,278
cuts why not

777
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,000
well that's the beauty of a black market

778
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,839
industry a clandestine industry it's it

779
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,679
leaves a lot of room for snakes to come

780
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,199
in because the only reprisal is is

781
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,960
physical there's not like legal

782
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,919
reprisals for anything right but then

783
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,519
that doesn't mean that there's not

784
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,880
people that are going to like trademark

785
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,119
the name

786
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,600
oh yeah yeah for sure you know and try

787
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,519
to control it and say this cut is it

788
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,278
because they want to make money off it

789
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,519
and you know there's a risk that it's

790
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,319
like imagine somebody else tries to like

791
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,480
imagine somebody tries to to to you know

792
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,000
trademark the chem 91

793
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,038
and then anybody else growing it or

794
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,200
using it has to give them kickbacks

795
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,240
yep

796
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,399
you know um so there's all this weird

797
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,720
stuff where there's like there's all

798
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,879
this compartmentalized tribal knowledge

799
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,600
about cuts

800
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,799
and it's not widely known a lot of it

801
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:02,879
and people use that murkiness

802
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:04,558
to hustle a lot of fake history yeah

803
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,399
and even sometimes some of the most

804
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,398
people that would be in the know some of

805
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,798
the old-timers

806
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,319
they're part of that same issue

807
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,158
yeah because they'll tell you there's

808
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,480
plenty of old-timers

809
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,520
that have come out of the shadows

810
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,679
and ended up scamming people

811
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,679
because they have

812
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,600
prominent their name itself who they

813
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,440
were where they came from

814
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,119
yeah you know there was a famous

815
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,240
incident with uh

816
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:35,359
um you know the g13 cut

817
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,720
yes yeah yeah that was a little weird

818
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,558
you know um and uh the person that was

819
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,120
offering it and selling it for a lot of

820
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,398
money had impeccable provenance

821
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,079
yeah

822
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,079
but it was a scam

823
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,639
if i remember it was double d's cut of

824
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,960
g13 that was that dr green thumb said he

825
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,720
had then double ds said don't use my

826
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,840
[ __ ] name you didn't get it from me

827
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
if i remember correctly that's how it

828
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,798
went

829
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,240
neville at the time when we were talking

830
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,480
said that that's not the cut but then

831
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,319
neville also he told me hit up dr green

832
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,960
thumb and get some of them seeds for

833
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,200
free so who knows who knows where that

834
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,038
story really landed you know yeah but

835
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,399
that that's exactly kind of the thing

836
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,960
where it is

837
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,038
you get claims there's sales happening

838
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,519
you get arguments by various people

839
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,759
involved who all don't agree

840
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,398
people are tempted to buy it right

841
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,398
because everybody knows that controversy

842
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,439
uh sell seeds

843
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,119
yeah

844
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,798
right so there there's there's also

845
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,879
people that i won't name

846
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,158
uh that i think are kind of sociopathic

847
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,840
in the seed game

848
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,440
um but they said something i think was

849
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,959
really revealing one time even though

850
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,919
people were giving them a lot of [ __ ]

851
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,880
about a lot of fake releases

852
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,278
he said everything i released sells out

853
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,559
yes and you could see that that was what

854
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:49,679
mattered to him

855
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,839
yeah

856
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,679
right and so a lot of these people

857
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,839
foresee you know for seeds it's like

858
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,759
that's really what matters to them

859
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,439
they want them to sell for the pack

860
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,519
price

861
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,038
yeah you know the truth is genetics from

862
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,879
me the truth is uh a cut of my maui

863
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,640
uh by superdog

864
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,640
uh and it was it was uh seeds i gave to

865
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,880
mandelbrot and he found

866
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,880
he found it and some apparently some

867
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,159
rasta he was smoking with said this weed

868
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,080
is the truth

869
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,399
because he got super buzzed

870
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,079
uh and that's the moniker that got added

871
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,398
onto it

872
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,879
um but yeah he's saying

873
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:32,079
stoney puff and stuff again mark emery

874
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,200
almost every seed maker post neville

875
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:37,119
either added mystery confusion

876
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,278
uh or some lies

877
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,398
in order to sell seats if i remember

878
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,759
correctly stony's the pnw hash planet

879
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:45,278
okay

880
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
really that's yeah that's why i have his

881
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,000
name on my head right now because of

882
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,319
that yeah

883
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,398
so i mean and there's you know and and

884
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,558
basically now we're in this point

885
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,199
um where you know the history might

886
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,119
become valuable because almost every 80s

887
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,798
and 90s famous line

888
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,119
is starting to have its day in the sun

889
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,879
again getting offered as seeds and

890
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,918
people claiming to have the real deal

891
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,840
holyfield yeah

892
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,880
there's one thing i'd like to cover

893
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,959
um

894
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,440
and that is how how

895
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,960
how groups and clone groups were formed

896
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,038
because we did kind of touch on you know

897
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,880
going to the parties back in the day but

898
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,158
i've noticed that that that's one of the

899
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,080
questions i get from some of the

900
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,278
youngsters in our our breeder syndicate

901
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:31,918
discord chat is like how do i even get

902
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,599
to these groups with these cuts like how

903
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,000
does that even work it's a foreign

904
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,480
concept to them and it's just like you

905
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,919
just make friends with people and you

906
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,278
talk you shoot the [ __ ] a lot of times

907
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,640
you're not even talking about weed when

908
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:43,839
you shoot the [ __ ] with someone you're

909
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,240
just talking about what you have in

910
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,079
common and over time people decide okay

911
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,278
this person is full of [ __ ] or they're

912
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,960
not and we share because we're friends

913
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,558
and that's that's kind of how it goes

914
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,558
and it's a slow process sometimes you

915
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,639
don't ever share anything you know in a

916
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,599
group sometimes you share everything you

917
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,120
have and

918
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,639
you know that's how it goes but that's

919
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,558
how the groups used to work it's it's a

920
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
lot different than than just going and

921
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,918
buying the cuts today

922
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,320
i would say

923
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,759
that like if peop the grail

924
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:16,240
of to me of uh of that kind of situation

925
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,158
when you actually like go jedi master or

926
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,240
whatever and you get beyond most trading

927
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,640
and people just want to give you things

928
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,480
yeah is that you just have to be honest

929
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,720
about what you're after and what your

930
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,880
intentions are

931
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,798
the whole time yeah

932
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,960
and then if you're honest and people

933
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:34,798
like you and you're not pulling anything

934
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,679
on them because you're honest

935
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,759
like you you know you get you get into

936
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,038
more and more different groups because

937
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,038
there's only so many collectors yeah

938
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,158
it's a small community that's always

939
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,480
been the case

940
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,159
everyone wants what's hot and what sells

941
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,079
for a high dollar

942
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,159
but actual collectors that are holding

943
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,240
on to things for like how they breed or

944
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,760
how they love the weed or whatever else

945
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,000
that's pretty rare

946
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,759
and when when people pass me these lists

947
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,119
that people send them like cloneless and

948
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,398
say hey do you think this person would

949
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,479
have this or that the first thing i

950
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,000
think is who is this person connected to

951
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,839
who does this person know that i know

952
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,119
that's in these groups because you know

953
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:12,720
usually if they're showing off like a

954
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,639
really rare clone it's like okay who's

955
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,558
he connected to who would he have had

956
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,159
access to to get this cut is that very

957
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,000
likely how rare is the cut who do we

958
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,840
know that's currently holding it this is

959
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,599
all involved in provenance and looking

960
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,359
through it and trying to figure it out

961
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,639
and um yeah a lot of times it doesn't

962
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,398
add up anymore

963
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,440
and you have a you can have a situation

964
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,439
where

965
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,120
you know a lot of us know each other and

966
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,600
so what matt was just talking about it

967
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,639
might involve a few phone calls

968
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,639
and

969
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,640
you know and like cross-referencing and

970
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,679
checking yeah

971
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
you know

972
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,480
uh

973
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,278
and all that and so you know and because

974
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,720
there's a thing too where like up here

975
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:49,839
you know um

976
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,360
and there was like there's you know

977
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,918
we'll get to it in a bit there was like

978
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,240
a a nugget that created this show

979
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,799
essentially or the idea for this show

980
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,798
um but it is it's really hard to get

981
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,440
people that's what makes that's what

982
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,519
makes me laugh so much is that it's so

983
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,480
hard to get anyone to hold on to old

984
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,480
things

985
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,599
that whenever you just see a tsunami of

986
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,878
old things you're like well [ __ ]

987
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,599
yeah you know yeah no you know i wish

988
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,199
there was no and the thing is is that so

989
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,720
everybody asked me about my like my

990
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,838
collection and all this different stuff

991
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,918
so

992
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,078
you know my collection is basically like

993
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,440
i'd like to say that it had some like

994
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,800
master plan or i knew eventually one day

995
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,559
you know i mean i like to breed and

996
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,280
stuff so like holding on to plants i

997
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:39,039
think are cool uh i do that sometimes

998
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,359
but mostly uh it's um you know it's it's

999
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,159
stuff i personally like to smoke

1000
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,679
yeah

1001
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,480
and i didn't care

1002
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,599
if

1003
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,960
um if it was valuable

1004
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,320
to others it was valuable to me

1005
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,159
right uh and for the most part most

1006
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
people just want what's easy to sell

1007
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,200
right now

1008
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,440
yeah and they'll dump

1009
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,679
whatever they were selling before that

1010
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,358
isn't as easy as the new thing

1011
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:09,039
yeah very quickly

1012
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:10,880
very quickly you know and um and so you

1013
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,800
know did i think one day holding on to

1014
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,640
all this stuff like i don't have

1015
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,560
you know a bunch of my old cuts because

1016
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,960
i had some master plan

1017
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,400
yeah i had old cuts because i liked

1018
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,920
growing them in the greenhouse or

1019
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,639
whatever and having some head stash

1020
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,320
along with whatever else i was doing

1021
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:27,679
and i liked making hybrids with them

1022
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,960
because they're my and then maybe i get

1023
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,719
better wheat

1024
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,280
yeah

1025
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,399
you know but that's not most people

1026
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,720
honestly

1027
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,680
they hold on to cuts because the value

1028
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,639
that they put on the cut is monetary

1029
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,199
yeah

1030
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:46,319
whether by breeding with it selling

1031
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:48,639
clones of it or selling flour of it

1032
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,400
you know and i i saw someone just uh

1033
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,480
made a comment that you know like well

1034
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,639
provenance is [ __ ] it's in the flower

1035
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,400
make a produce flower and that's cool

1036
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,078
except for the fact that a lot of the

1037
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,000
times that the cuts people are hunting

1038
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,160
they've never had any experience with

1039
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,920
the flower before in the first place so

1040
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,519
how are they ever going to

1041
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,358
then smoke the flower and be like yep

1042
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,880
this is the one you have to have

1043
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,719
experience with with it in the first

1044
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,160
place to be able to do that so while i

1045
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,519
agree with that if you don't have the

1046
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,719
experience with it in the first place it

1047
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,960
doesn't really do

1048
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,039
anything better than um

1049
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,199
trying to establish that oral history

1050
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,440
you know luckily luckily we're not so

1051
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,039
far forward that a lot of these people

1052
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,559
are totally gone a lot of people are

1053
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,719
still around that we can you know trace

1054
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,559
hand to hand to hand to hand back

1055
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,759
and then there's a there's an aspect

1056
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:36,799
where it's like how old is your memory

1057
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,200
yeah just because you had a cut for x or

1058
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,680
i had a cut for x amount of years

1059
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,519
and then you go 10 or 15 or 18 years

1060
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,440
without seeing it

1061
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,838
are you just because you had it are you

1062
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,358
certain to be able to 100

1063
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,039
identify it again

1064
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,400
this is the problem we have with trinity

1065
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,440
and it's and it's the reason that

1066
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,838
nobody's like me csi no one's willing to

1067
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,440
say yes this is the [ __ ] one you know

1068
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,199
as much as i would like to as much as it

1069
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,200
would probably sell seeds better if i

1070
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,598
were it's just like it just

1071
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,000
the memory isn't there anymore half the

1072
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,280
half my crew thinks it is half my crew

1073
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,559
thinks it isn't

1074
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,200
yeah

1075
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,279
you know um and uh you know someone just

1076
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:19,039
said trades used to happen off samples

1077
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,000
you know how hard it is for me to get uh

1078
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,000
um

1079
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,639
to get samples from people of strains

1080
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,480
that they have a flower that they grew

1081
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,039
yeah because a lot of people get clones

1082
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,880
just to flip them for other clones yeah

1083
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,800
or to build their stable or to this or

1084
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,640
that or whatever you know so

1085
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,920
it's there's an aspect where um you know

1086
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,118
it it

1087
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
i don't know

1088
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,519
uh

1089
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,280
memory gets tough

1090
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,838
yeah it does

1091
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,000
you know it really does so and

1092
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,000
psychosomatic stuff it is always a

1093
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,880
factor too and bias and wanting to have

1094
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,960
it there again like finding that old

1095
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,480
you know forgotten clone

1096
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,480
that's got to be it you're already

1097
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,480
wanting it to be it so it can be it you

1098
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,079
know so that's all somebody just said

1099
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,599
one thing i i will agree with is that

1100
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,880
the trinity cut that we have and is

1101
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,359
floating around

1102
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,000
is um is really good wheat

1103
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:12,559
yeah so regardless of the truth of it or

1104
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
not it's enjoyable it's very enjoyable

1105
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,159
smoke

1106
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,159
it's also similar it's also similar a

1107
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,399
little bit to the train wreck trinity

1108
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:22,480
that that i grew from jill it has a lot

1109
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,639
of similar traits to that and i think

1110
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,079
that was an older cut using the old

1111
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,679
trinity but i'm not 100 on that yeah and

1112
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,599
i mean there's there's a thing too now

1113
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,519
where it's like you

1114
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,000
um you know there's certain cuts that

1115
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,838
i've had for long enough like you know

1116
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,519
if i was to lose the chem dog or

1117
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,920
something like i would be able to

1118
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,358
recognize if it was real again yeah

1119
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,680
because i've been growing it since the

1120
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,440
late 90s and i've grown it a lot

1121
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:48,960
and it's super unique looking and

1122
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,358
smelling i just i just have such a

1123
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,119
relationship like the smell of it

1124
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,719
you know and like the look of it and the

1125
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,079
way it makes me feel

1126
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,358
you know it's like that's not something

1127
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,880
that i had like a short-term

1128
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,480
relationship with that's like something

1129
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,320
you were like made like you were married

1130
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,400
to your wife for 20 years like you could

1131
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,079
you can you can hear a voice yeah and

1132
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,880
you know it's you know it's just that

1133
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,359
kind of some things are like that but

1134
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,680
you know it's it's hard because

1135
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,319
most people in weed and there's nothing

1136
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,358
wrong with this are younger

1137
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,920
and

1138
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,639
they want access to their history and

1139
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,480
all these famous old cuts

1140
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,799
and they're willing to give up money or

1141
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,199
see you know or other clones or this or

1142
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,480
that or whatever else and so there's a

1143
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,078
there's a group of people that are

1144
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,320
ethical about that and there's a group

1145
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,000
of people that aren't yeah

1146
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,119
and there's somebody that's asking me oh

1147
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,199
we need s-ones that la kush bro oh and

1148
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,440
so i don't know if like this is kind of

1149
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,679
like we're almost an hour in so maybe

1150
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,800
we'll chat about it but

1151
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,078
matt

1152
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,240
matt spoke about like we joke about how

1153
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,240
um you know we'll talk about something

1154
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,838
not that we're super important but like

1155
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,118
you start talking about something and

1156
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,559
you you get you get people also talking

1157
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,960
about it right

1158
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,119
and then all of a sudden you see it pop

1159
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,119
up

1160
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,839

1161
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,159
so

1162
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,838
matt matt and myself we were discussing

1163
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,799
it this week and it's i think in the

1164
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:14,719
last

1165
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,920
eight months ten months

1166
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:20,480
there's been three different breeders

1167
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,800
that have put out seeds that have by the

1168
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,800
nazo's la cush label

1169
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,599
yeah not so's headband

1170
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,720
yeah right where in the previous 15

1171
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,359
years that label didn't exist not once

1172
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,799
not one time anywhere ever

1173
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:35,598
yeah right no

1174
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,519
no

1175
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,039
you know uh

1176
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,039
whatsoever and then all of a sudden i

1177
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,519
start talking about it and not only does

1178
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,519
the name it's it pop up but my name gets

1179
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,199
associated with it the only time your

1180
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,800
name got associated with it originally

1181
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,480
was when in our group because there were

1182
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,480
two different headbands we like the one

1183
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,400
that we had and the one that you had and

1184
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,880
we had to identify it so we would have

1185
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,599
like referred to it as that you know but

1186
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,119
it was never a popular name before we

1187
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,880
would talk about it

1188
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,960
and that's a lot of how some of these

1189
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,358
internet names like none of us ever use

1190
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,280
the term i use the term chem 91 often

1191
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:12,000
now because it's a good communication

1192
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,280
tool yeah but none of us ever called it

1193
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,519
that yeah that's an internet term

1194
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,760
just like the skunk vacuum

1195
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,639
yeah that's an internet term

1196
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,359
you know um it was never said you know

1197
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:28,400
and so you know i get that people might

1198
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,799
want to like attach names to cuts

1199
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,960
because it helps differentiate yeah

1200
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,519
that's just being proportioned

1201
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,358
sure and you know for me i was anti it

1202
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,960
happened anyway

1203
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:40,719
some people

1204
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,000
some people attach their name to cuts

1205
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,759
intentionally

1206
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,280
yeah when they know they had nothing to

1207
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,720
do with it

1208
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,480
you know like

1209
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,480
i don't know lupa headband something

1210
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,000
like that yeah yeah so he got the cut

1211
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,679
from someone else

1212
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,358
and he decided i'm gonna say it's the

1213
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,919
best weed in the world

1214
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,159
and it's my week yeah

1215
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,039
you know and uh

1216
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,960
um

1217
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,119
you know and uh

1218
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,760
you know and then there's so there's

1219
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,519
this aspect where it's like it puts me

1220
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,240
specifically in this weird conundrum

1221
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,199
right

1222
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,959
where

1223
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,039
um there's a small group of people out

1224
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,960
there that think that i'm chatting with

1225
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,880
all you guys every week that matt and i

1226
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,760
in order to do some like long running

1227
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,559
scam

1228
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,040
yeah

1229
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,559
because most people can't most people

1230
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,079
don't actually like

1231
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,279
um

1232
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,760
what's the best way to put it most

1233
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,240
people don't think how you think

1234
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,000
yeah most people think that what would i

1235
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:36,959
do in his shoes

1236
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,719
yeah

1237
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,480
right and since most breeding is about

1238
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,239
money and it's not about love or

1239
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,000
cannabis or anything like that like they

1240
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,318
feel like there has to be something for

1241
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,159
it right yeah so i chat about stuff matt

1242
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,920
and i chat about stuff we generate some

1243
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,920
interest which is very kind of y'all to

1244
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,838
have interest in so there's interest in

1245
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,838
these seeds and these cuts and this this

1246
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:56,719
and this that but i don't sell that

1247
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:57,519
stuff

1248
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,358
so

1249
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:00,800
there's a small group that thinks oh

1250
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,960
this is what's coming

1251
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,039
yeah but since i'm not doing it there's

1252
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,559
another group that's just adding my name

1253
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,279
to [ __ ]

1254
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,039
and you can buy my clones

1255
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,800
that my name on it

1256
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:18,239
or my hybrids with mine with my strains

1257
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,720
that from people i've never met

1258
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,719
or you know and and i can't i can verify

1259
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:26,239
he's not coming he wasn't even breathing

1260
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,358
hard before he said that

1261
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,000
uh

1262
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,358
you know so um so then what do you do so

1263
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,519
it's like so

1264
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,960
if i offer it then like it i wasn't

1265
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,280
about the history i was just trying to

1266
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,440
pump you all up into some [ __ ] to

1267
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,599
sell it to you yeah but then if i don't

1268
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,838
offer it other people are going to offer

1269
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,838
it to feed the desire

1270
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:48,480
and so we've gone nobody's used the word

1271
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,078
not so's headband in 15 years and then

1272
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,240
we have three different people using it

1273
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,280
to breed with in the last eight months

1274
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,639
and clones of it for sale

1275
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,319
right and these people have never

1276
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,199
reached out to me or talked to me or

1277
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:04,559

1279
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,960
investigation to make sure that like

1280
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,159
they think they have the same thing

1281
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,559
no no

1282
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,159
not whatsoever that's a lot of work

1283
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,759
that's a lot of work you know so it's

1284
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,519
just like all of a sudden somebody sends

1285
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,440

and i have no idea and then if you get

1289
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,720
mad about it they just like it because

1290
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,239
then it's just more controversy and

1291
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,559

00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,599
important you know

1320
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,838
but it's just one of those things where

1321
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,599
it's like i have people all the time on

1322
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:32,639
this show dm me can we get cuts can we

1323
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,480
get seeds can we this can we that

1324
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,000
right and so i've never really done that

1325
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,000
to the public i've done it mostly in

1326
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,480
private to friends

1327
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,159
but then if i don't do it public

1328
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,199
there's going to be scammers that see

1329
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:47,440
there's an opportunity and just do it

1330
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,439
and some people are going to get scammed

1331
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,000
called the catch-22

1332
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,679
you know so what do you do

1333
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,920
you know and then there's a funny thing

1334
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,598
too right where it's like i see this

1335
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,680
with headband and sour all the time and

1336
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,240
i'll keep talking about it because it's

1337
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,078
it's relevant uh obviously diesels and

1338
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,318
headbands and sours are sort of kind of

1339
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,720
having their time in the sun again

1340
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:11,199
they had a brief five or six year period

1341
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:13,279
of not popularity as purples and various

1342
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,519
things swept the land again

1343
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,720
but now they're coming back

1344
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,960
and

1345
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,559
everyone wants to have the oldest

1346
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,079
realest best

1347
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,639
cut of either

1348
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,240
yeah so they can sell flour or seeds at

1349
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,279
high prices to people that want to

1350
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:32,799
experience the real deal or clones or

1351
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,119
clumps or sell clones for 300 500 800

1352
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,039
000 bucks whatever it might be

1353
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,960
right so

1354
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,199
i don't know that i have

1355
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,400
i don't know that i i've had i got this

1356
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:48,318
hour 22 years ago i got the headband a

1357
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,559
year after that so 21 so oh what 2000

1358
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,400
2001 right in there right

1359
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,279
yeah i don't know their provenance

1360
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,280
before they came to me

1361
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,279
they came to me with a label

1362
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:03,358
do i know for sure that my cut is the

1363
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,040
original diesel 2 cut that i don't

1364
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:07,119
i just know that i've had it since this

1365
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,358
year and never lost it

1366
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,480
yeah do i know that sour is the right

1367
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,119
sour

1368
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,719
and the real sour and the one that manny

1369
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,240
found in the bag of weed i don't know

1370
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:18,159
that either

1371
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,000
but i've had it since 2000 and i haven't

1372
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:22,960
lost it and most people

1373
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,880
that are selling these ancient cuts now

1374
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,400
got these diesel cuts within the last

1375
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,039
few years

1376
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,880
yeah and so their history of it doesn't

1377
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,719
even go back very far

1378
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,318
so what you're saying is your cut must

1379
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,639
be the

1380
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:39,119
albany sour

1381
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,318
well that's the funny part is that five

1382
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,599
years ago

1383
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,920
because there's a story too that

1384
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:49,440
matt and pip and a bunch of friends kept

1385
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,358
asking me well which cut is it

1386
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,519
right and i got it a long time ago and

1387
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,519
it came helpfully labeled sour d and so

1388
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,719
i thought i had sour d and so i never

1389
00:47:55,519 --> 00:48:00,559
traded anyone ever for sourdy

1390
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,318
why would i i had to cut and i never

1391
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,119
lost it and i liked it

1392
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:05,279
so

1393
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,599
then matt and pip and other friends

1394
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,760
start telling me well there's rez cut

1395
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,480
and there's shroomie and there's amish

1396
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,559
and there's ecsd and there's choco and

1397
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,079
there's new york city

1398
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,519
and so i start collecting all these

1399
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,839
things

1400
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,358
and growing all of them and it ends up

1401
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:23,440
none of them are my headband and none of

1402
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,598
them right my sour

1403
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,679
and now when i collected all those there

1404
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,280
wasn't anything called the the catskills

1405
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,838
cut

1406
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,880
that the albany cut there's like there's

1407
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:34,880
a bunch of amherst

1408
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,240
no you know no j plant speaker of which

1409
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,079
i know he doesn't really like his name

1410
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:43,358
being attached to it there there's about

1411
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,200
half a dozen new sour names that have

1412
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,440
just come up in the last three or four

1413
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,679
years

1414
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,639
right and everyone ties back to the mid

1415
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:52,159
90s

1416
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,920
guaranteed

1417
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,639
and most of these people if you ask them

1418
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,720
how long they've personally held the cut

1419
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,838
it's a it's it's a you could count the

1420
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,558
number of years on one hand

1421
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,159
yeah

1422
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,240
you know and so i don't know that my

1423
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,239
shit's the real deal i know that i like

1424
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,598
it a bunch and i know that i've had it a

1425
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,399
long time

1426
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,318
but it doesn't seem like the chain goes

1427
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,160
all the way back to when it started

1428
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,679
where you can guaranteed where like

1429
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,920
people have it

1430
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:20,879
so everyone just claims they have it

1431
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,400
yeah

1432
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,920
and none of these people want to send it

1433
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,639
to the original sour people for

1434
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,440
confirmation

1435
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,239
no

1436
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,480
they just

1437
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,639
don't have a clue who they could send it

1438
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,159
to that's in the sauerkraut most people

1439
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,318
still think that

1440
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:37,598
whoever goes on the podcast and claims

1441
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,119
that they have

1442
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,400
yells the loudest that they're the sour

1443
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,960
guy is who it is and rez got his sour

1444
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,200
cut supposedly in 07

1445
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,639
you know 06 something like that

1446
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,159
and then he released the line called

1447
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,039
sour diesel

1448
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,960
yeah ibl which made it even more and

1449
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,800
then you know people would get bag seeds

1450
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,960
and call their bag seed sour diesel yeah

1451
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,960
right and so there's a bunch of people

1452
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,199
right now selling cuts for hundreds of

1453
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,800
dollars that they're very very very sure

1454
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,719
that it's the oldest and the best on the

1455
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,200
realest deal

1456
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,799
and selling you expensive flour to try

1457
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,480
real sour diesel

1458
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,559
yeah

1459
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,960
and because there's a bunch of desire

1460
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,720
for it there's not a bunch of uh ethics

1461
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,039
around it

1462
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,719
and you can whine and [ __ ] and moan and

1463
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,480
ask questions and then they just get

1464
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,078
pissed off

1465
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,240
and their buddy and their buddy and

1466
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,240
their buddy and they find out the names

1467
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:35,118
of who it came from originally and then

1468
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,118
that's you just had it

1469
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,720
so there's there's another aspect that i

1470
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,239
had written down here and this is one

1471
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:43,598
like this is this is the conversation

1472
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,558
that i have with a lot of people that

1473
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,480
sell seeds behind the scenes and and

1474
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,400
one of the ones that's repeating that we

1475
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,800
we always come back to is how do you

1476
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,760
compete in a market of dishonesty where

1477
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,119
the loudest the cheapest or the most

1478
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,079
expensive it what is what usually um

1479
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,079
sells it's not necessarily who can prove

1480
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,920
that they've sourced it correctly it has

1481
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,359
nothing to do with what sells in all

1482
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,440
honesty

1483
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:11,679
very very few people care about that so

1484
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,679
in a market where the name is what's

1485
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,519
selling along with the trademark and

1486
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:17,199
brand

1487
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,119
how do you compete

1488
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,719
if you try to do it the right way when

1489
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,318
it takes months

1490
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,639
it takes years to source something

1491
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:27,119
correctly at some times and then looking

1492
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:30,400
through the line then testing the line

1493
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,160
how do you compete in a market like that

1494
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,720
yeah that's tough

1495
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,519
yeah none of us have ever figured it out

1496
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,519
i mean

1497
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,679
in the mats in the seed market more and

1498
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:41,358
the flower market

1499
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,039
it's the same thing where

1500
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:44,960
you try to grow the i try to grow the

1501
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,039
you try to grow the best weed you can

1502
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,800
yeah and not everybody does that most

1503
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,679
people don't do that most people try to

1504
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,160
grow

1505
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:53,759
you know just barely good enough to pass

1506
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:55,598
yeah that's that's kind of the market

1507
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,440
it's always been the market but if you

1508
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,240
grow really good dank

1509
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,480
um then you're gonna battle with brokers

1510
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,838
that always tell you that they can get

1511
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,639
cheaper dank yeah and since their

1512
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:09,440
goal is margin

1513
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:11,679
right

1514
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,240
they would rather buy something worse

1515
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,719
that they get a bigger range on

1516
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:18,479
in terms of profitability that week than

1517
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,039
something better with a narrower range

1518
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,039
where they give a fixed price yeah and

1519
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,239
so they'll always they'll be like if

1520
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,800
they if they look at you and say this is

1521
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,959
the best weed i've seen in six months

1522
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
they're not gonna offer you more for it

1523
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,599
yeah

1524
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,440
you know but they're gonna everyone

1525
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,359
tries to kick the tires and make your

1526
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,119
weed worth less

1527
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,639
so they can get bigger margin from

1528
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,318
whatever they're doing

1529
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,480
yeah and so that's this it's the same

1530
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,159
thing with like with with flour even

1531
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,440
it's like you can grow real flour but

1532
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,719
like

1533
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,400
you know and there's a bunch of people

1534
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,000
up in my neck of the woods that got used

1535
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,920
to got pissed off and just got used to

1536
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,760
growing bee weed

1537
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,440
because that was what sold and that's

1538
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,960
what moved and it like why put in the

1539
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,318
all the extra effort

1540
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,039
yeah and now the market's so tanked you

1541
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,880
know um you know they haven't grown fire

1542
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,960
in a really long time

1543
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,960
they've grown decent commercial

1544
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,639
yeah and they used to be able to survive

1545
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,639
off decent commercial and now they can't

1546
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,720
you know because it's been a long time

1547
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,160
and so same thing with seeds it's like

1548
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:19,519
you know they you're going to flood the

1549
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:20,719
market and then you have a situation

1550
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,119
where if you're ethical and you want to

1551
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:25,199
test stuff before sale

1552
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,640
someone's always going to beat you to it

1553
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,719
always and that's why when people are

1554
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,799
saying you know like well just grow the

1555
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:33,199
fire and fire will prove it's that's not

1556
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,880
how it works i mean greenhouse let's

1557
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:36,159
look at the the top of the industry

1558
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,358
greenhouse

1559
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,078
dna

1560
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:42,000
you know like uh dynafem

1561
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,760
this is the top of the industry even in

1562
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,280
the us you got compound you know burner

1563
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,960
this is the top of the industry so do

1564
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,440
you really think fire is going to make

1565
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,079
it through all this when that's the

1566
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,400
custom the market's customer driven

1567
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,000
and customer driven means that rappers

1568
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,760
probably are driving the market so at

1569
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,559
what point does fire win

1570
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,720
and i laugh when people from florida

1571
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,319
and virginia and georgia i don't it's

1572
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:08,078
not it's not like i'm laughing at them

1573
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:09,759
but it's like when people from these

1574
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,160
various states are like oh man you

1575
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,319
california and you just grow the booth

1576
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,480
yeah and i'm like no no no

1577
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:18,639
you're the brokers that that brought it

1578
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,159
to you they bought the booth

1579
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,159
yeah they probably had a different

1580
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,759
choice but they made more money off the

1581
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:24,639
booth and they still thought you'd buy

1582
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,559
it

1583
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,118
yeah so that's what they're bringing you

1584
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,040
yeah if you insisted upon real fire and

1585
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,119
refused to buy the booth they'd have to

1586
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:35,119
change their game

1587
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,880
right but they were buying the boo for

1588
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,720
cheap and flipping it to you for a

1589
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,960
little less expensive and their margin

1590
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:44,639
was better yeah

1591
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,760
so you know boof exists for a reason

1592
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,358
in that regard yeah it does you know and

1593
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,119
and there's an aspect too where it was

1594
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:52,639
like this week you know once again i'm

1595
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,559
not i won't mention names or anything

1596
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:56,960
but like you know matt got upset because

1597
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,960
my name got used and you know the

1598
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,798
person's response was basically like oh

1599
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,480
he's just butt hurt that we beat him to

1600
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,759
making seats

1601
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,280
i could have you know i could have been

1602
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,200
begging not so for that cut when we met

1603
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,960
and i've never asked for it once

1604
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,558
you know you know and it's because they

1605
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,920
know that there's like there's a market

1606
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,839
out there for it there's people that are

1607
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,920
excited to try it and since i'm not

1608
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,599
feeling that market they're like [ __ ] it

1609
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,480
i'll beat them to it i will

1610
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,480
yeah

1611
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,240
and i'll do it better than he can

1612
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,280
yeah and it's marketing they're just

1613
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,679
trying to sell something what are you

1614
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,040
gonna do six months later complain

1615
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,239
that the cross didn't come out the way

1616
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:29,759
you thought

1617
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:31,519
yeah and most people don't pop their

1618
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,960
seeds right away so even six months most

1619
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,798
people are working at two and a half

1620
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,880
three years before they get to the seeds

1621
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:38,719
that they purchased and the seed game

1622
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,920
much like the flower game as matt will

1623
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,598
say is

1624
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:46,480
uh in rough choppy waters right now

1625
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:49,359
sales are down and uh expenses are high

1626
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,119
and and volume is low

1627
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,119
um and so people are searching for

1628
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,358
whatever little edges they can

1629
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,358
yeah

1630
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,318
you know

1631
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,400
uh and so it's a real issue where it's

1632
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:02,079
like people ask me so

1633
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,798
if i was to do something where i was to

1634
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,119
like offer up cuts or offer up seeds

1635
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:08,318
uh and try to fill a demand that a bunch

1636
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,920
of people have

1637
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:10,960
i would be selling out

1638
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,559
yeah

1639
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,159
but if i don't

1640
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,480
other people are going to and are going

1641
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,159
to and are doing it currently

1642
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,838
and it's not even real

1643
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,598
yep

1644
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:24,000
uh and part of the reason why matt and i

1645
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,838
started this podcast was just to give

1646
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,358
certain weed heads an opportunity to

1647
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:29,358
hear real

1648
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:32,000
yeah when there was just a sea of

1649
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:34,400
self-serving disinformation

1650
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,159
and infomercials and some really bad not

1651
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,680
that there's not some quality talks out

1652
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,879
there so don't everybody feel bad but

1653
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:41,919
like just

1654
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,480
you know an attempt to like get get some

1655
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,000
at least some stand against the [ __ ]

1656
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,240
yeah

1657
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,239
yeah

1658
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,400
i mean

1659
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:54,318
you know people already didn't like me

1660
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,519
it wasn't going to hurt my reputation to

1661
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:56,719
do this [ __ ]

1662
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:57,519
and uh

1663
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,798
yeah

1664
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:00,159
it was nice to be able to do it with

1665
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:02,079
someone that had a good reputation

1666
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,399
already you know what i mean and that's

1667
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,640
honest so and it's interesting in the

1668
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,720
sense that the more i talk

1669
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,400
like it's nice that there i get people

1670
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:13,039
that you know matt and i do get quite a

1671
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,280
bit of nice messages about this thing

1672
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:17,039
um but there also is resentment and

1673
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,599
anger and hatred

1674
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,679
yeah because we'll do a history episode

1675
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,039
and you know all of a sudden i'll say

1676
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,279
something or matt will say something

1677
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,719
that contradicts some narrative that

1678
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,400
somebody else has and we don't even

1679
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,798
mention them by name

1680
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,720
but they're pissed off

1681
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,079
because it it undermines what they're

1682
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:35,598
trying to do

1683
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,599
yeah there's a lot of things i would

1684
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,920
love to talk about and even even with my

1685
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,760
loose lips like as far as uh

1686
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,960
you know talking about what i feel like

1687
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,640
talking about there's a lot of things

1688
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,559
that i don't talk about

1689
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,039
somebody just asked so who does right

1690
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:53,440
now if you wanna if you wanna get any

1691
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:56,880
headband crosses from me um uh you can't

1692
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,559
but uh i did share the cut with uh uh

1693
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,079
with csi

1694
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,319
and there's some really [ __ ] good

1695
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,079
ones and he released some tk and some

1696
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:06,318
chem d and people send me stuff all the

1697
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,798
time it looks like those are both really

1698
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,558
nice hybrids especially the d um he'll

1699
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:11,599
probably be releasing some more stuff in

1700
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,160
the future

1701
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:16,798
uh i'm still on the fence about myself

1702
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:18,318
um but uh but you know he has it

1703
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,000
directly from me

1704
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,159
and i gave it to him so he could make

1705
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,838
seeds so people could have a chance to

1706
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,118
grow some hybrids of it because he's got

1707
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:26,798
a big reach

1708
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,720
yeah you know

1709
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,719
and all that different type of stuff

1710
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,558
um and uh

1711
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:33,439
you know there's a there's a thing too

1712
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,880
where

1713
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,440
matt and i think that probably within

1714
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,760
the next five years the seed market will

1715
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,760
probably shrink a lot

1716
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,119
and thus the breeders will probably

1717
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,599
shrink a lot

1718
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,440
yeah i i say in the next six six months

1719
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,519
we're going to see a drastic decline

1720
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,838
back to where it was you know maybe a

1721
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:53,679
few years ago you already see a lot of

1722
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:54,960
people starting like opening up the

1723
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,960
vault

1724
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,400
yeah and offering a bunch of stuff from

1725
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,240
their collection that they're like what

1726
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,079
the [ __ ] am i gonna do with this what am

1727
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,399
i gonna do with this maybe somebody else

1728
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,920
wants it maybe i can generate some money

1729
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,838
yeah the amount of boats rvs various

1730
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,960
things up here for sale

1731
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:15,039
uh you know the the downturn in cannabis

1732
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,720
right now has caused a fire sale amongst

1733
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:20,159
all sectors

1734
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:22,159
yeah it has you know uh fire sale of of

1735
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,798
all sectors and uh

1736
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:26,159
um you know and so

1737
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:28,559
you know there's

1738
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:31,679
part of the reason why uh

1739
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,280
there is a a decent amount of my work in

1740
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:36,159
modern things

1741
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,040
is because i was really stupid back when

1742
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:41,838
prices were high 20 years ago and i was

1743
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:43,199
growing seeds for me and friends

1744
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,960
on the side

1745
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,598
when everybody else was just bumping out

1746
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,119
flour and getting high prices

1747
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,440
so there wasn't that many people

1748
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,160
breeding 20 years ago and you were in a

1749
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,760
perfect spot for distribution in that

1750
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:57,679
area where people growing mass amounts

1751
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,280
of weed yeah i mean as far as

1752
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:02,399
distribution as far as getting friends

1753
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,920
to try it sure as far as making sales no

1754
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,079
no not sales but no

1755
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,318
it was a it was a passion project money

1756
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,000
losing venture yeah and so as soon as

1757
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:11,679
the easy money goes out of it i

1758
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,679
anticipate most of the breeders that

1759
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,798
mostly just mash together stuff via

1760
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:18,879
reversals we'll go do something else

1761
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,079
yeah

1762
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,160
um

1763
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,960
and uh you know

1764
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:24,719
so

1765
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,960
you know it'll probably shrink which you

1766
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,358
know there'll be a bunch of volume uh

1767
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,679
shrinkage and then the people that are

1768
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:32,880
passionate about it will stay in it

1769
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:34,798
yeah

1770
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,240
and then you'll have less options but

1771
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,159
you'll probably have better people to

1772
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,798
buy from overall

1773
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:44,399
i hope so i hope so i mean when there

1774
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:46,400
was a uh not a big like burst in the

1775
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,240
scene before cookies and stuff when

1776
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,240
seats were still kind of small there's

1777
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,639
probably 50 of us worldwide you know

1778
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,000
2006 to 2008.

1779
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,558
now there are

1780
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,838
thousands and thousands so i i hope it

1781
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,319
gets smaller

1782
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:02,318
just because it was nicer people weren't

1783
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:03,679
as cutthroat but i mean

1784
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:04,960
you know it's cool it's cool seeing a

1785
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,399
lot of different people's point of view

1786
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,358
though like being able to see all the

1787
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,280
different

1788
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:11,358
um crosses and stuff from all the

1789
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,960
different points of view is always cool

1790
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,798
yeah i mean that that is neat and i'm

1791
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,199
not trying to dissuade anyone i mean i

1792
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:19,599
always say on the show when and i say in

1793
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:21,519
private too when people ask me

1794
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,798
like how should i focus on being a good

1795
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:25,119
breeder

1796
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,798
and i always say like you know try to

1797
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,760
breed things you like

1798
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,599
yeah try to like i like i like these

1799
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,079
things from this plant and these things

1800
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,480
from this plant i wonder if i cross them

1801
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,599
could i get the traits i like of both in

1802
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,000
a single plant yeah could i make wheat i

1803
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,039
like myself

1804
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,960
you know

1805
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,719
uh people time please put the cookie

1806
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,480
lineage out there or not the the cookie

1807
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:51,118
thing is like i don't know when we'll

1808
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,920
get to the cookie thing uh that might be

1809
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,440
that might be a while it's hard one of

1810
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,000
the reasons why

1811
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,400
uh matt and i started like in the 80s

1812
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,318
with neville and the city and the and

1813
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,039
corel and the city club and all that is

1814
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,798
that

1815
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,760
um there was less people to get mad and

1816
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:06,639
argue

1817
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,920
yeah

1818
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,078
yep

1819
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,559
yep you start in the 80s and you go to

1820
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,160
the 90s and there's only there's there's

1821
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,960
less humans that are gonna get mad at

1822
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:16,960
you

1823
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,519
i only get sam skunk man mad at me right

1824
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,838
now for for what we've done i mean he's

1825
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:23,280
is like trying to be a a billion dollar

1826
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,558
empire

1827
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,880
they're definitely positioning

1828
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,640
themselves to sell out to like you know

1829
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,200
some huge corporation when it goes

1830
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:33,519
federal um they have stores all over the

1831
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:36,719
place they're big into branding

1832
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:38,239
um and all that and so trying to

1833
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,358
you know that's like really poking the

1834
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:41,038
dragon

1835
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:42,400
um because they don't give a [ __ ] about

1836
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,160
the truth

1837
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,838
like the truth is irrelevant to them

1838
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,598
they're building they're trying to build

1839
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:50,400
an enormous brand

1840
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:52,960
with stores all over the nation

1841
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,400
and clothing and all this different [ __ ]

1842
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,920
yeah i mean there was footage of bernard

1843
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,358
going into city council meetings and

1844
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,480
talking about the illegal growers in

1845
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:02,960
that city by name so i pissing people

1846
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,199
off who do [ __ ] like that is not my bag

1847
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,798
not no they got they've got and you know

1848
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,798
they're backed by a lot of money and

1849
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,719
stuff like that and so you know i know

1850
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:13,119
that there's i know that and it's not

1851
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:14,798
that's not the only reason

1852
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,200
i'm not going to do it yet part of the

1853
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:19,038
reason is is that uh there's a lot of

1854
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,558
lying and there's a lot of stories to

1855
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,920
unravel and

1856
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:26,079
um you know i do try to when i talk to

1857
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,880
people to be pretty upfront about what

1858
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:31,119
we think we know for pretty sure

1859
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,000
and what we are unsure of

1860
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,440
yes

1861
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,199
and so when everyone has a different

1862
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,599
story and everyone's kind of a shady

1863
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:39,679
shady liar and everyone has issues

1864
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:40,798
uh you know i know a lot that people

1865
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:43,679
don't know

1866
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,759
um but i don't think we you know we're

1867
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:47,440
not quite there yet yeah we don't have

1868
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,960
the full picture yet i don't think we're

1869
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,960
quite there yet so

1870
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,639
uh as a result of that we're probably

1871
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,400
you know and since like matt and i

1872
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,480
started way back

1873
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:01,200
we've just barely gotten to talking

1874
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,159
about the last 10 or 15 years yeah

1875
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,318
you know

1876
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:06,078
uh and i still want to go back i still

1877
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:07,679
want to go back and cover the 90s forum

1878
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,359
era because that one episode we kind of

1879
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,399
just went on a tangent and that would be

1880
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:11,920
fun to do

1881
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,680
so i mean one of the one of the things

1882
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,280
one of the things talking about you know

1883
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:16,798
we can tie this into provenance or

1884
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,319
whatever you know and like strain

1885
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,079
history is

1886
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:23,038
like as you know cookies is a good

1887
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,318
example so you know skittles is too and

1888
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,359
all these different things where it's

1889
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,960
like

1890
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:32,880
you have a loose association of friends

1891
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,720
with no contracts and no organization

1892
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,200
and then a strain that comes out of

1893
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:38,159
their little circle gets hella famous

1894
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,598
yeah

1895
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:43,440
and then there's a grab of who does what

1896
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,280
so there's four or five or six people

1897
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,159
tightly involved in the cookie story

1898
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,160
early

1899
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:50,000
yeah as far as like when it got famous

1900
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:52,480
forget about like how it got made or the

1901
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,920
various steps but as far as like after

1902
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:58,318
it started getting providence yeah right

1903
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,798
and there's no contract so who gets what

1904
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:02,880
piece of a pie

1905
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:05,119
you know same thing with with skittles

1906
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,480
skittles used to be you know tony mendo

1907
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,480
and fields and

1908
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,599
and uh and third gen

1909
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,838
shiloh

1910
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,519
um and then you know there was battles

1911
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:16,400
over direction and this and that and

1912
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:17,759
everything else and it split into into

1913
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,318
two camps

1914
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:23,039
yep and then you know shiloh and brandon

1915
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:25,119
didn't get along and so they split

1916
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,440
uh and so fame and money has been the

1917
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,559
end of a lot of close of weed

1918
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,280
friendships

1919
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,280
yeah because who owns it

1920
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,359
who should profit off it who gets what

1921
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,760
who did what

1922
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,920
you know um and look at burner you know

1923
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,359
burner's the face of cookie i can tell

1924
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,079
you straight he had nothing to do with

1925
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,038
it

1926
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,400
yeah

1927
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,599
oh

1928
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,838
he promoted

1929
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,838
he's a great clothing guy though yeah he

1930
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:51,920
promoted it and he's good at promoting

1931
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:53,759
and he look has the part and and all

1932
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,760
that and so the guy that had the least

1933
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,200
to do with it got to be the most famous

1934
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,440
face of it

1935
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:59,439
yeah

1936
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,200
you know people are kind of learning

1937
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,720
like some people say nobody owns the

1938
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,480
plant

1939
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:08,318
yeah

1940
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,599
people say someone just said nobody owns

1941
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:11,199
the plant

1942
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,000
uh there's a lot of people that are

1943
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:15,118
going to be trying to own plants yes

1944
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,159
you watch

1945
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:21,200
owning plants trademarking names uh

1946
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:22,639
trademarking strains genetic markers all

1947
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:23,759
that different types of [ __ ] that's all

1948
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:25,598
coming

1949
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,119
yeah and you know for me that's very

1950
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,559
complicated because i'm one of those

1951
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,440
people's like [ __ ] dad i don't want to

1952
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,880
[ __ ] deal with that [ __ ] like but

1953
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,480
i'm going to be the one who loses out in

1954
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,160
the end for not giving a [ __ ] not

1955
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,559
wanting to do it you know what i mean so

1956
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,318
it is it's another catch-22 that like if

1957
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:43,039
i don't at least learn about it and how

1958
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:45,920
to protect myself then i'm going to get

1959
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,760
railed i had an interview this week

1960

their you know not like like is it good

1969
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:08,078
enough to sell out or anything like that

1970
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,079
but yeah just like you know thoughts on

1971
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,000
like how people are arranging

1972
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,359
because a lot of these things you know a

1973
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,880
lot of these nurseries a lot of these

1974
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:16,318
rich people it's like one of the things

1975
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,880
they don't have is they don't have the

1976
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,558
stories they don't have the cuts and

1977
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,079
they don't have the know-how

1978
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,079
yeah none of it and they all thought

1979
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,240
they could buy their way into

1980
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,559
a clandestine scene

1981
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:31,279
the marketing you know the lawyers the

1982
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,160
certifications the licensing

1983
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,319
the

1984
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:35,199
real estate they got all that

1985
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:36,719
yeah

1986
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:37,919
so there's a big thing where it's like

1987
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,480
it's almost like they're going around to

1988
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:45,200
desperate growers and be like you know

1989
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,159
um do you want to license your [ __ ]

1990
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,239
you know

1991
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:52,159
but then it's like who like for instance

1992
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:52,159
like who licenses the chem 91

1993
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:56,399
duh t-bud

1994
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:57,598
but yeah you know but i'm serious

1995
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,000

2008
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,640

kind of stuff is coming so it's one

2014
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,039
thing if like you want to talk to a

2015
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:39,198
breeder and like

2016
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:40,960
you know freaking uh fletcher wants to

2017
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:44,238
license rainbow belts

2018
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,719

2019
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:48,559
but what about every old cut that just

2020
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,119
came out of the ether

2021
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,159
and got traded around

2022
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:55,679
there's people that are going to be

2023
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:57,039
attempting to lock those in

2024
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,719
that's coming

2025
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:00,640
yeah i always wondered why um rob

2026
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:04,319
clark's name was associated with og kush

2027
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,759
on philos over at thai that was weird

2028
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,759
and those guys you can look around i

2029
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,520
mean though like philos exists in a

2030
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:11,198
different form now

2031
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,040
you know and i saw and there's different

2032
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:14,559
and you and you look and there's there

2033
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:16,158
you know i love rob clark and his

2034
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,120
contributions to cannabis but he's

2035
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:19,679
awesome

2036
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:21,519
he's on some suspect boards

2037
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,679
yeah yeah you know of some of some

2038
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,640
companies and stuff like that you know

2039
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,560
um

2040
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,000
and uh yeah all these people who has the

2041
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,440
claim to the stake and then when and

2042
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,198
then like

2043
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:33,198
and then how much of that stake and then

2044
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,559
whatever and it's like a lot of these

2045
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:36,479
people are just trying to collect

2046
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,199
genetics and dangle money in front of

2047
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,959
you

2048
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:41,198
yeah and not even money for buying it

2049
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,480
like money in the future like like spot

2050
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:44,000
us to them

2051
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,278
and then we sell a bunch of them we'll

2052
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,439
give you money

2053
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,440
yeah but really we need to give us the

2054
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,198
collection first

2055
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,639
and that's going on all over the place

2056
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:54,559
and they're looking for

2057
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,079
uh they're looking for they're looking

2058
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,320
for desperate people

2059
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:00,800
yeah for sure and and unfortunately for

2060
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:03,119
them and unfortunately for the scene

2061
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,719
they don't give a [ __ ] if it's real or

2062
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:05,760
not they just want someone to tell them

2063
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,399
it's real

2064
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,920
and if it's a big enough company

2065
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:12,559
that proliferates

2066
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,560
more than any real cut ever would and

2067
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,840
that's how things change for good that's

2068
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,840
human

2069
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:21,199
when it first happened

2070
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,159
um in the 90s uh strains got trademarked

2071
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:24,879
right

2072
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:26,158
so i bought i bought super skunk direct

2073
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,679
from neville

2074
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:32,238
um in the in the in the late 90s right

2075
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,000
um but it was called ultra skunk

2076
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:34,959
yeah because

2077
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,960
uh

2078
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,920
scentsy owns super skunk

2079
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,399
yep they own the name

2080
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,880
you know um you know a white widow is

2081
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,399
owned by greenhouse

2082
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,840
even though their breeder who you know

2083
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,319
shanti left

2084
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,920
or whatever it's it's like they own it

2085
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:54,158
it's almost like someone saying they own

2086
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,000
breeder syndicate

2087
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:57,679
yeah people get the name they get the

2088
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,279
name or whatever and so that so what's

2089
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:02,399
cool about history

2090
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,158
uh in any case not just weed history but

2091
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,119
uh humans aren't really that much

2092
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:07,359
different

2093
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,039
yeah so by studying the past you'll

2094
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:12,559
start to see a lot of people a lot a lot

2095
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:14,399
of similarities in in the end today

2096
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,560
and what happened in amsterdam in the

2097
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,519
90s is happening again

2098
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,840
yes

2099
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,880
you know you might even say arjun is is

2100
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,239
is you know greenhouse was the

2101
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,960
dutch cookie

2102
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,759
yeah very much so you know

2103
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,399
the

2104
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,679
rich backed by backed by a bunch of

2105
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:34,639
capital

2106
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:37,520
right really connected backers

2107
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,840
yeah all that type of stuff you know um

2108
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,560
and there's big money behind all that

2109
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,119
and

2110
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,960
just like just like a greenhouse did

2111
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:46,640
when they went to south africa and

2112
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,600
africa they got all their strains there

2113
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:51,679
and it took out a lot of those heirloom

2114
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,120
mines they're gone i was just talking to

2115
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,039

they're gone we see burner going to

2117
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:59,519
thailand and we're going to see again in

2118
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,960
the next several years those heirloom

2119
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,679
lines are going to be gone and replaced

2120
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,439
by what is being pushed over there

2121
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:08,560
what's being what's selling best over

2122
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:10,479
there i mean a lot of a lot of morocco

2123
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:13,039
is dutch strengths

2124
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:16,079
yeah a lot of jamaica has been replaced

2125
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:18,880
by fast-growing uh dutch dutch genetics

2126
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:20,640
in jamaica same with mexico that kind of

2127
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,319
stuff starts getting it starts getting

2128
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,159
pushed around and things like that you

2129
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:25,519
know and so you know cookies doesn't

2130
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:27,439

01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:35,839
grow weed for them

2135
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,880

01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,279
and burner was at the grand opening

2143
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,800
but they don't grow wheat because that's

2144
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:54,238
too complicated they're they're uh

2145
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,159
they're a brand

2146
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,799
i remember back in the day he said we

2147
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:01,279
aren't into genetics that's for nerds

2148
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,920
i never forgotten that when they started

2149
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:05,359
selling seeds i was like oh that's cute

2150
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,199
you know yeah i mean but it's like

2151
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:09,439
that's the you know

2152
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:12,079
you can knock it but obviously

2153
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:13,759
you know he's in this for you know

2154

01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,239
yeah he wants i probably should be too

2156
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,319
but you know but it's like that's that i

2157
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:21,678
mean that's like you know

2158
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,198
there you know there's there's nothing

2159
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,600
wrong with money and there's nothing

2160
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:27,678
wrong with making a living sure i'm just

2161
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,120
saying that like some people like don't

2162
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:31,359
really give a [ __ ] at all about what

2163
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,679
they're involved in they just want hits

2164
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:34,559
yeah yeah right they just want to make

2165
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,719
money

2166
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,039
they just want to survive

2167
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,399
you know and uh

2168
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,000
and you know so they're opening all

2169
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:44,000
these stores in these different places

2170
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,640
and all that and you know they have

2171
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,119
dozens you know they they make contracts

2172
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,000
with dozens of people they don't

2173
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:52,319
yeah

2174
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,319
a lot of brands don't grow wheat most

2175
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:56,880
big famous brands not that i'm not

2176
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,439
picking on cookie most big famous cali

2177
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,199
brands are not vertically integrated and

2178
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,279
rarely grow their own work

2179
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:05,678
yeah or they have one small grow that

2180
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:07,519
doesn't fill their brand and they give

2181
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,960
clones to other growers to fill the

2182
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:12,159
brand and make the mark up on the

2183
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,158
difference yeah

2184
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:15,519
so you know the brands are starting to

2185
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,238
become more important than the weed and

2186
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,239
then

2187
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:19,119
and then when you're in a situation

2188
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:20,479
where

2189
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:22,079
uh

2190
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:23,519
uh

2191
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,279
you know um

2192
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,360
i just started reading the comments

2193
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:29,359
again and got totally distracted yeah

2194
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:30,559
sure when you're in a situation where

2195
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:32,399
you uh

2196
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,080
you know you buy weed and mylars and you

2197
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:36,238
can't even see or smell it most of the

2198
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:38,238
time yeah because it's just got a bunch

2199
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:40,319
of opaque art on it

2200
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:42,799
it's sort of like a mystery bag

2201
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:45,359
yeah

2202
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,440
you know um they license cuts and then

2203
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,119
they you know and then are they even the

2204
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:51,678
real cuts

2205
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:53,519
it doesn't matter in the end you know it

2206
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,880
doesn't even matter

2207
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,239
yeah and they you know they have

2208
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,159
different breed they don't even have

2209
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:00,000
like in-house breeders

2210
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:03,359
yeah they have breeders they work with

2211
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,600
like they worked with uh jbz for a while

2212
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,198
who also buys seeds from other people

2213
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,280
yeah and you know they work with

2214
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,039
compound and they work they they farm

2215
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:12,880
out all that stuff

2216
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,479
yeah so they're always on the lookout

2217
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,679
for different people that you know and

2218
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:17,519
it's like well you know you want to

2219
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,440
stand next to burner and smoke weed at

2220
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,679
openings and get more rep

2221
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:23,919
and get your weed in the store you know

2222
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,840
but i want to make sure it's clear a lot

2223
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,158
of that is farming out to people who

2224
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,319
farm out those weren't actual people

2225
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:32,000
making seeds that you mentioned they

2226
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:32,880
they were hired to make seeds and farmed

2227
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,279
it out

2228
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,960
yeah there's there's layers of farming

2229
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,559
yeah there's lots of layers there's

2230
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,079
layer and

2231
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,159
you know there's layers there's layers

2232
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:43,679
to all that like i contract with you to

2233
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:45,599
do this you say you're going to do it

2234
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:47,520
you hire your friend to do this and it's

2235
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,039
like it's very

2236
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,960
you know

2237
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:54,238
so there's an aspect where

2238
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:57,920
you know um right now like history is

2239
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:57,919
mostly useful for marketing

2240
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:02,640
right

2241
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,840
that's kind of how i see it

2242
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,880
yeah it seems to

2243
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:11,840
be nope he's cutting out he must be

2244
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,840
in a bad spot

2245
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:15,679

2295
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,640
a core group of us that are really

2296
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:09,119
interested in it

2297
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,560
and there's uh a bunch of people that

2298
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:12,399
are only interested in the marketing

2299
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,400
aspect yes

2300
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:17,359
and while there might be a great amount

2301
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:19,839
of interest in the public about it

2302
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,839
right um that doesn't mean that like

2303
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,079
that leads to a bunch of people honestly

2304
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,840
trying to go forth and figure it out

2305
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:28,319
yeah no that and rarely does that

2306
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,679
because it takes time it takes money and

2307
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:31,039
time

2308
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,199
friendships

2309
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,960
trust respect

2310
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:37,519
that would be funny if we were talking

2311
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,279
about the cfam and i got cut off because

2312
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,199
like uh

2313
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:43,599
it triggered some algorithm that they

2314
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:46,399
pay for yeah you know and they were just

2315
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,560
like nope nope cut the signal yeah cut

2316
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:50,399
the signal this is not the publicity

2317
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,080
that we're into come back with nothing

2318
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:53,599
with a hole in his head

2319
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:55,600
but you know i'll mention something

2320
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,640
about about about cookie just from like

2321
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:01,920
a personal standpoint like in the uh

2322
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:03,600
you know i'll never have a good a good

2323
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,319
collection of

2324
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,920
uh

2325
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:06,960
of cookie cuts

2326
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,840
because

2327
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,359
uh

2328
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,279
there's too many things to try to hold

2329
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:12,960
on to already

2330
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,119
and i don't personally like most of them

2331
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:18,399
very much yeah

2332
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:21,119
so it's like you can't hold everything

2333
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:22,719
you know because that's that's crazy

2334
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:24,719
so you really have to pick and choose

2335
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,480
what you personally enjoy

2336
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:28,319
yeah and it's going to be interesting

2337
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,639
now because

2338
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:32,960
cookies is just old enough where

2339
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:35,600
people start talking about like

2340
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:38,319
do you have the real forum

2341
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,600
is that the real 09 animal

2342
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:42,319
yeah yeah

2343
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,520
right is that who's got the thin mint

2344
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,158
yeah

2345
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,480
who's got the and the and the

2346
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:51,198
the hands on that is pretty terrible you

2347
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:53,759
got that amherst kind of cookies

2348
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:55,279
oh my gosh the amherst thing bugs the

2349
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,719
hell out of me because

2350
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:58,000
i mean that was like with the diesels

2351
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,760
and stuff like that that was literally

2352
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,319
just something like uh mandel just

2353
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,400
decided to add on to the story yeah why

2354
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:05,679
not you know when i gave them cuts

2355
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:08,000
yeah and then all of a sudden there's

2356
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:10,880
amherst sour diesel or whatever you know

2357
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,279
yeah so

2358
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,119
uh animal animal is one of the better

2359
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:18,158
ones but mostly because it leans way

2360
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,279
more closer to og yeah i like the more

2361
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:21,439
gassy

2362
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:22,238
you know the gas the gas stuff tends to

2363
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:23,839
have

2364
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:25,919
you know the problem is might be my

2365
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,520
biggest issue with with with uh cookie

2366
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,840
but you know not to just diss the hell

2367
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,840
out of them or anything is that i think

2368
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,920
cookie came out in this in this era

2369
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,119
where they got [ __ ] hard where

2370
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:39,440
um ig happened so visually appealing

2371
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,960
weed was super important yeah and

2372
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:42,000
testing was starting to be super

2373
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,319
important

2374
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,439
and there was probably good highs in

2375
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:47,759
that weed

2376
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:51,439
that got sacrificed for better looking

2377
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,880
better testing lead yeah

2378
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:54,638
and then they lost the high and they

2379
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,600
can't get it back

2380
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,440
yeah

2381
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,480
kind of that's kind of how i see most of

2382
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:00,719
cookie

2383
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:02,000
yeah i mean they they were playing and

2384
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,158
they weren't breeders and that's what

2385
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,920
happens when you inbreed

2386
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:07,279
yeah yeah it really is what happens i

2387
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,679
mean that's what happened to blueberry

2388
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:11,279
it needed some uh need some new juice it

2389
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:13,359
needs to be outcrossed to something

2390
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:16,158
completely different yeah

2391
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:18,000
you know um and uh you know and so but

2392
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:19,759
that's kind of like like cookies and

2393
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,679
skittles and you know all that kind of

2394
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,079
stuff that's sort of like the start of

2395
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:25,760
what maybe i would consider like

2396
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:29,519
modern marketing

2397
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,280
and hyping in cannabis yeah

2398
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,080
that's where that's where it started

2399
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:34,000
yeah

2400
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:36,319
i would have to agree because before

2401
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,279
that it's like so silly

2402
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:39,599
like

2403
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:41,519
in the previous era before that where

2404
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,760
like sauer diesel was king

2405
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,320
nobody cared what cut of sour diesel you

2406
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,600
had it just had to be gas and good weed

2407
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:52,319
and sell yeah so all this all this [ __ ]

2408
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,480
about like which exact one it was

2409
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:56,079
was semi-irrelevant when brokers were

2410
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:58,158
pounding on the door demanding a bunch

2411
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:59,760
of it [ __ ] it didn't matter if it was so

2412
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:02,079
much new york city diesel it smelled

2413
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,480
like [ __ ] grapefruits and perfume

2414
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:07,039
yeah they would you know like it just

2415
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:10,158
went and so like this massive thing of

2416
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:11,119
tracing down sour lineage is almost kind

2417
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:12,000
of new

2418
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:14,238
yeah

2419
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,079
it's newer i would say yeah and it's

2420
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:17,519
only been in the past like decade that

2421
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:19,198
we've been able to kind of put it push

2422
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,440
everyone all together that was involved

2423
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:23,198
with it same with og same with all this

2424
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:24,879
other stuff some of the really quiet

2425
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:26,799
people were some of the most important

2426
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:29,119
and only really started posting or

2427
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,360
talking or communicating with people to

2428
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:32,960
spread their part of it yeah and that's

2429
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:34,000
another issue with provenance that we

2430
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,520
should mention

2431
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,439
is that often the first and the loudest

2432
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:42,480
and the most consistent with their story

2433
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:43,359
gets their story out yes and they might

2434
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:45,839
not

2435
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:48,000
and that might not actually be accurate

2436
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,400
yeah but if they don't have anybody

2437
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,039
challenging them from the group

2438
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:53,920
yeah it can stand uncontested for some

2439
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:54,880
time

2440
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,679
yeah

2441
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,199
like take for instance um you know

2442
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:01,600
there's multiple cuts that i think are

2443
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:04,158
really good cuts that are headband yeah

2444
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,039
but matt and i consider to be og cuts

2445
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:07,279
yeah

2446
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:09,359
but they're all claimed every single one

2447
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:12,319
is claimed to be original new york city

2448
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:14,399
headband came from new york

2449
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:17,119
from new york the original head band the

2450
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,960
legendary one yeah right

2451
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:21,840
you don't know what you're talking about

2452
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,760
and then just when the last year or so

2453
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,119
manny and swell and some others started

2454
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:29,280
talking about what that cut looked like

2455
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:32,880
and it turns out it was very fox

2456
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:35,039
taily diesely looking skunky cut yeah

2457
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:37,920
and all of a sudden people holding real

2458
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:40,079
new york city headband guaranteed

01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:33,039
anything like like like the guys from

2483
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:36,238
back in new york describe the original

2484
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:37,840
headband that they grew as yeah

2485
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:40,399
but you know that took that only

2486
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,360
happened within the last couple of years

2487
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:43,439
yeah

2488
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:45,359
you know i'm down to get that to get

2489
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:47,039
those quotes and [ __ ] yeah to get those

2490
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,799
quotes and to get them to confirm

2491
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:50,960
exactly what it was like and to get them

2492
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,760
public maybe a small group of friends

2493
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,520
knew

2494
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,679
yeah but it wasn't something that was

2495
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,440
widely disseminated and so when there's

2496
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:00,399
legends and there's very little

2497
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:02,158
information on them it allows a lot of

2498
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:05,279
people to just step in and say well this

2499
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,279
is well this is what's true

2500
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:10,639
you know um

2501
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,800
and uh

2502
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:14,000
you know so there's an aspect right

2503
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,400
there where

2504
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,479
um provenance is only cared about

2505
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:20,319
by a few people

2506
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:21,919
most of it used it for marketing or

2507
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:24,158
sales

2508
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,319
uh and um

2509
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:28,158
you know and then you know once it

2510
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,319
becomes popular

2511
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:32,399
it's like as soon as it's as soon as all

2512
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:34,799
this stuff is unpopular again all the

2513
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:37,119
old stuff will go away

2514
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,800
because nobody will care

2515
01:25:37,119 --> 01:25:40,399
they won't take the magic power of a

2516
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,239
sharpie and a label

2517
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:44,158
yeah

2518
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:46,238
a lot won't remember

2519
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:47,198
they won't remember

2520
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:48,158
you know

2521
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:52,000
um

2522
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:53,439
and uh you know there's yeah so there's

2523
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,359
p and you know one of the one of the

2524
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,039
cool things too was even like on even on

2525
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,719
like our discords and stuff like that

2526
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:00,000
where uh matt and a bunch of friends of

2527
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:01,600
mine gather

2528
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,760
uh when we started throwing those

2529
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,520
parties around emerald cup

2530
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,719
it was for a lot of us because a lot of

2531
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,040
us were from different parts of the

2532
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:11,279
country it was some of the first time

2533
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:14,158
that we got to get together and actually

2534
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:17,920
smoke personal flour of each other's

2535
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:20,000
yeah and put highs and flavors and and

2536
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:23,199
visibility to like what was just talking

2537
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,479
in pictures before yeah

2538
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,079
you know

2539
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,959
um

2540
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,079
and you also like this is for real like

2541
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,279
i mean

2542
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:33,198
if you're gonna go hang out at one of

2543
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,840
these events always remember to bring

2544
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:37,279
something cool and that that doesn't

2545
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,880
suck because

2546
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:40,238
your ass gonna get judged by what you

2547
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,159
bring no matter what no matter what

2548
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,879
strain it is how it's grown you're gonna

2549
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:45,920
get judged that's how it goes so come

2550
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,840
correct

2551
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:52,319
that's just a little advice for

2552
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,920
people yeah and i mean it it uh

2553
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:55,439
um

2554
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,920
and you know that's the other part of it

2555
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:00,158
is it's like it's hard to grow good weed

2556
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,560
yeah too you know i

2557
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:03,359
you know i saw this thing where i grew

2558
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,080
uh

2559
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,759
um you know our buddy pip gave me his

2560
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:09,600
version of the east coast sour diesel

2561
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,560
when i was doing my head to head to head

2562
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,039
to head

2563
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,480
diesel comparisons yeah and i grew it in

2564
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:16,479
the sun and he came out to one of our

2565
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,799
parties and he was like oh my god dude i

2566
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:19,599
think i've only grown it that nice twice

2567
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,199
yeah

2568
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,199
i don't think i did anything incredibly

2569
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,439
special i just think that

2570
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,519
the soil it was in in the sun

2571
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:30,000
and the the the weather that year was

2572
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:32,480
nice and it just came out nice all of

2573
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,600
the diesels came out really really um

2574
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:37,279
flavorful from that depth that yeah that

2575
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,560
year yeah yeah that was that was a good

2576
01:27:37,279 --> 01:27:40,079
year and so i had a lot of good weed

2577
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,960
those couple of those those few years

2578
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:44,319
before covet ruined it or whatever but

2579
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,319
um

2580
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:48,559
you know but a lot of times it's like

2581
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,479
you hear about a bunch of this weed

2582
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,320
and you and but you it's not like

2583
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:53,439
everybody gets to smoke it

2584
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:55,679
yeah

2585
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:58,000
it's not like you know csi is sending me

2586
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:59,760
and matt like dozens of samples all the

2587
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,960
time of all the things in his library to

2588
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,840
peruse

2589
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,840
oh he's not he didn't send you oh no no

2590
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,279
no no probably not

2591
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,079
yeah weekly

2592
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:11,920
weekly week daily yeah the daily your

2593
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:14,719
daily just go check the po box and it's

2594
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,480
there you know daily for daily supply

2595
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:19,359
perfectly cured and so yeah there's

2596
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:21,119
people there's there's people that uh uh

2597
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:22,719
that were that are that are asking oh

2598
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:24,800
you should release it you should you

2599
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:26,399
should this and so there's a part where

2600
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,560
it's like

2601
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:30,000
so maybe we'll maybe we'll throw out a

2602
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,639
little bit of like soapbox or

2603
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,439
pontificating here for a second right

2604
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,679
uh

2605
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:39,039
the reason why i hold strains

2606
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:40,719
is basically one reason i like them

2607
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:42,800
yeah that's how that's how a strain gets

2608
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:44,480
held by me for a long time and it's also

2609
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,920
this thing where

2610
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:47,678
you know it's like it's part of our

2611
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,480
heritage and history

2612
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:51,199
right

2613
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:53,678
and so if enough people hold on to

2614
01:28:51,198 --> 01:28:55,439
enough strains that they like

2615
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:58,480
then there's a reasonably good chance

2616
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:00,000
that a bunch of diversity survives yeah

2617
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:01,599
and there's only so many people that are

2618
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,198
willing to do it

2619
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,600
like if you're holding it hoping that

2620
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:07,359
one day it ends up being super valuable

2621
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,920
you'll probably be bitter

2622
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:12,000
yeah we we actually saw a case of this

2623
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,158
where a friend at the time

2624
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,359
finally got a hold of an old cut and he

2625
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:16,559
thought because he got a hold of this

2626
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:18,719
old cut that it was going to make him

2627
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,320
rich and or famous and it didn't turn

2628
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,600
out that way yes and he was going to be

2629
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:23,039
able to make seeds and there was going

2630
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,760
to be various things that happened with

2631
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:27,760
it and it was going to like unlock

2632
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,360
he was going to be leveling up

2633
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,920
leveling up that's a good way of putting

2634
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:32,639
it yeah and it didn't work you know

2635
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,239
and

2636
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:35,440
if you really loved it and it was just

2637
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:36,319
about it then that wouldn't have

2638
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:37,839
mattered

2639
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:40,000
yeah none of it

2640
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:41,679
because you know if i was trying to like

2641
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,439
if i was trying to gain a bunch of reps

2642
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,199
from my seeds and a bunch of money from

2643
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:47,359
my seeds then like all my breeding is a

2644
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,039
total failure and i'd be so pissed

2645
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:50,719
yeah because everybody would be like oh

2646
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:53,039
people stole it from me and did this

2647
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:55,679
with it did that with it or whatever but

2648
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:59,359
if your goal is to preserve it and you

2649
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:00,239
want people to smoke better weed

2650
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:02,319
right

2651
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:03,759
like the guy getting all pissed thinking

2652
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:06,000
that like i'd be all pissed off because

2653
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,400
i was beating him to the punch

2654
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,520
like i i want people to smoke better

2655
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,479
weed

2656
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:14,000
yeah i think diesels and you know and

2657
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:15,519
those kind of plants are better weed

2658
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,920
than a lot of what's been bred with in

2659
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:20,239
the last few years

2660
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,319
so you know i'm happy that there's weed

2661
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:24,638
out i want good pot

2662
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:26,880
yeah i want good pot to to to use to

2663
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:28,560
make better pot to then

2664
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,079
make better pot than other people used

2665
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,679
to make better pot

2666
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:34,079
exactly and eventually everyone's going

2667
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:36,480
to forget who the [ __ ] you are yeah i

2668
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:38,639
mean most of all nobody after a hundred

2669
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:39,759
years dude or even after 30. i mean

2670
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,760
everything

2671
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,840
neville might be really famous

2672
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,440
but most of the stuff that he bred is

2673
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,239
bred into other things and his

2674
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:50,079
contribution and name to it is lost even

2675
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:52,959
though it's probably the backbone of a

2676
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:55,279
ton of stuff we work with he's famous

2677
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:57,920
for like a few of us nerds and that's

2678
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:59,840
about it anymore and that's unfortunate

2679
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,920
because he should have that that special

2680
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:03,039
place right see so there's all kinds of

2681
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,399
people that i'm chatting about this

2682
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:06,319
they're like please let's do it please

2683
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:07,439
let's do it release do this kind of

2684
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:08,639
thing and i could do this you could do

2685
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:11,119
this thing where you could be cool and

2686
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,960
you could maybe offer that

2687
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:15,279
right but then you're a capitalistic

2688
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,158
sellout piece of [ __ ] yeah like the only

2689
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:18,238
people that are allowed to be

2690
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:20,238
capitalistic sell out pieces of [ __ ] are

2691
01:31:18,238 --> 01:31:21,519
people that actually are that way yeah

2692
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:23,919
then they're just immune from it they

2693
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,199
don't care yeah they just don't respond

2694
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,119
they just they just they're just like

2695
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:28,960
whatever and they're just like oh yeah

2696
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:29,679
like i just proved you're exactly like

2697
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,279
me

2698
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:33,119
yeah

2699
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:34,559
right but most people who are listening

2700
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:36,238
to this

2701
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,120
probably are here because they like good

2702
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:39,359
wheat

2703
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:39,359
yeah

2704
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,040
you know like that's that's the weird

2705
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:44,479
thing and it's like i don't have like

2706
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:46,560
you know as matt's well aware like

2707
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:50,079
there's good friends of ours in the in

2708
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,239
our circle that have my strengths

2709
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:53,600
just because they're good friends

2710
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:56,399
yeah just now you know

2711
01:31:53,600 --> 01:32:00,159
everybody else yeah just not you

2712
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:01,679
you know but um i can't i can't then

2713
01:32:00,158 --> 01:32:02,960
people would say i'm using you can't

2714
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:04,639
happen

2715
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,639
yeah well i mean there's there's there's

2716
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:08,560
aspects to it too and stuff and it's not

2717
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:09,520
even so much like uh

2718
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,760
um

2719
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,719
you know life and covid and and it's

2720
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,719
it's been

2721
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,639
odd in the end really that's what

2722
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:19,279
exactly what would happen that's exactly

2723
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,880
what happened so it just can't it just

2724
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:22,800
you know one of those things and that's

2725
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,359
where i look at it like people don't

2726
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,840
believe that i actually gave that cut to

2727
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:30,158
our homie to make hybrids with just so

2728
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,319
more people could try it yeah no and i

2729
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:34,399
don't get anything for it no

2730
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:36,559
where like a lot of times people don't

2731
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:38,479
understand that like for a lot of people

2732
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:41,039
that hold cuts

2733
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:43,759
they demand any other breeder working

2734
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:46,399
with it pay them royalties or give them

2735
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:48,800
seed or make some kind of arrangement to

2736
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:50,559
do it there's a lot of like secret horse

2737
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,960
trading that goes on

2738
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,239
first people so people want to get in

2739
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,359
positions where like they're the

2740
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:59,359
controller of the cut yeah

2741
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:00,960
right and i just gave it to him because

2742
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:03,839
he's my good homie and i know he'll back

2743
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:05,359
it up for me and he won't pour it out um

2744
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,800
and i was like make as many hybrids as

2745
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:08,238
you want and a bunch of people are

2746
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,440
growing good weed and enjoying it so

2747
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:10,479
that's nice

2748
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:11,599
you know

2749
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:13,839
but that

2750
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,719
does that is that beneficial to me no

2751
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,079
no

2752
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:18,399
you know like not at least in a

2753
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,559
financial sense no

2754
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:22,479
you know um but

2755
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,320
but people can't conceive that you would

2756
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:26,479
have something valuable and just share

2757
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:26,479
it

2758
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,000
yeah i mean you you sure you're all your

2759
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,359
vibrators you're really cool about it so

2760
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,359
they can change that

2761
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:37,119
it's the it's the you know once once

2762
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,960
they're no longer good enough for me and

2763
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:40,238
i have to upgrade

2764
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:43,119
you know

2765
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:44,638
hey gotta share you guys gotta share

2766
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:46,158
and and so there's there's an aspect

2767
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:47,359
where it's like i know i'm not the only

2768
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:48,638
reason why i threw that out there is

2769
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:49,839
because

2770
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:51,679
like

2771
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,039
isn't isn't for people to be like oh he

2772
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:55,119
should have done this or this person

2773
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:56,158
should have done that it's more that

2774
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:58,079
like

2775
01:33:56,158 --> 01:33:58,960
you know not everything has to be about

2776
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:00,000
money

2777
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,359
yeah

2778
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,198
right not all the time now we do

2779
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:04,559
everybody needs money

2780
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:06,158
right and it's like so there's nothing

2781
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,840
wrong with selling i don't think there's

2782
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:10,559
anything inherently wrong with selling

2783
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,639
clones or selling seeds or selling good

2784
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,600
flour or like anything like that because

2785
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,639
it's like

2786
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,800
you're trading on value

2787
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,000
the problem becomes is that just because

2788
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,159
of humans

2789
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,520
a bunch of people are gonna scam you

2790
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,119
yeah

2791
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,440
that's really what's gonna happen and so

2792
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:28,960
then it's like i don't know like

2793
01:34:27,439 --> 01:34:30,559
um

2794
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,399
you know i think i would like there to

2795
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,159
be better weed more often

2796
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,000
yeah i think the current craze for the

2797
01:34:34,158 --> 01:34:39,359
last four or five years has led us kind

2798
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,880
of far away from better wheat

2799
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:42,079
it would be nice if better weed came

2800
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,000
back around

2801
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:45,840
it would

2802
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,679
and it's still around it's just you got

2803
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,800
to get in the right circles well the

2804
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,158
problem is

2805
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,760
that's exactly what i'm talking about

2806
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:53,039
where it's like it's always in certain

2807
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,039
circles

2808
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:56,639
yeah it's just the public how do you get

2809
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:58,399
the public to have it how do you get

2810
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:00,079
more people to access it how do you get

2811
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:02,079
young people that listens every week and

2812
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:03,679
loves our [ __ ] show or something and

2813
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:06,000
they would die to try it and there's

2814
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:08,880
nowhere for them to go yeah it's a

2815
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,279
conundrum it is a conundrum you know

2816
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,279
because there's nice people

2817
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:15,599
you know that are younger and into it

2818
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:16,960
and and hyped up and would love to try

2819
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,159
these different things that were talked

2820
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:19,679
about and

2821
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:21,679
and and all that different types of

2822
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:23,679
stuff and it's like there's not an easy

2823
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:24,800
verifiable way to figure out what to do

2824
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,719
that's right

2825
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,039
you know though but like i kind of look

2826
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:31,118
at the the discord chat is a good way to

2827
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:32,800
meet the people like the the next

2828
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:34,719
generation of people that are really

2829
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,159
passionate about this like they shine

2830
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,239
through real obviously because they're

2831
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:40,638
the ones who won't stop asking questions

2832
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:42,399
about genetics what's in this what did

2833
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:44,560
you use of this what did you see in this

2834
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:45,839
i [ __ ] love it like most people think

2835
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,000
you would probably get annoyed after a

2836
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,800
while but nerding out like that that

2837
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,960
that is one oh yeah people sharing all

2838
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:54,320

2840
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:59,679
bunch of cool stuff in the la la by d

2841
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,320
is because people send me stuff and

2842
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,319
smoke reports and pictures all the time

2843
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:06,719
yeah and they're pumped

2844
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,880
yeah i just i spent last month smoking

2845

2850
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,760
you know but it's like it's it's there's

2851
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:27,679
a way where

2852
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,280
uh how do you how do you figure that out

2853
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,880
because

2854
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:32,399
you know i don't know it it like this

2855
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,159
whole show was kind of based on that

2856
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:36,399
it's rambled a bit but it's like

2857
01:36:34,158 --> 01:36:38,559
provenance ethics

2858
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:39,839
how clone trading started where it is

2859
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,760
right now

2860
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,360
uh because i don't know

2861
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,119
i don't even remember i don't even think

2862
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:47,039
five years ago people were offering up a

2863
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:50,479
bunch of clones on

2864
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:51,679
on ig very often yeah they were but but

2865
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:53,439

2866
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:56,239
there's so many more trying to say they

2867

people weren't as interested in xyz rare

2869
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,480
cut from the 70s or 80s

2870
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,320
it's just there is that demand now for

2871
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:05,919
whatever reason so now yeah now there's

01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:32,479
been ongoing for a long time

2947
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,400
yeah it's just social media made it

2948
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:36,158
easier

2949
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:37,279
i think

2950
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:39,198
okay so

2951
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:41,519
we've gone pretty heavily through the

2952
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:44,238
provenance part and i do you want to

2953
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,080
talk any about any um of the new

2954
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:47,678
potential ideas that we have coming up

2955
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:49,519
we're probably going to do the the not

2956
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:51,920
so story time finally

2957
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,199
yeah we can chat about we can chat about

2958
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:55,520
all that so

2959
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:58,319
as people are uh may or may not be aware

2960
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,159
uh we have our uh we have our our

2961
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:03,279
discord back

2962
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:06,079
and and our and you know various things

2963
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:08,479
um and uh and we've been putting a bunch

2964
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:10,399
of content uh old content and some new

2965
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:12,879
content up on youtube

2966
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:14,399
right for people to chat about

2967
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,079
and so we thought rather than having

2968
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:18,559
like these long-winded rambling

2969
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:21,039
conversations every week that go in a

2970
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,119
million different directions at times

2971
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:25,600
we might be able to do like some more

2972
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:28,079
focused stuff yeah because a lot of

2973
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:30,639
times in the comments people ask to get

2974
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:33,118
hella focused on certain things yeah but

2975
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:35,920
it's hard to go off on those tangents

2976
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:37,039
yeah so what we're thinking about doing

2977
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,800
is uh

2978
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:42,000
uh matt's gonna do some of it but i'm

2979
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:43,279
gonna do uh a couple of things one of

2980
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,319
them is uh

2981
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:47,519
uh not so story time as matt likes to

2982
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:49,039
call it

2983
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,000
where people get to listen to me ramble

2984
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:54,719
about various canna stories or various

2985
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,279
historical bits or or funny things

2986
01:40:54,719 --> 01:41:00,960
yeah right one of them might just be

2987
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:03,198
a a five or ten minute uh discourse on a

2988
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:07,118
whole bunch of different strains

2989
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:09,439
yep nl1 nl5 this that whatever it might

2990
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:11,439
just be like the collected knowledge of

2991
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:13,118
this is what we know

2992
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:14,960
you know because a lot of times people

2993
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:17,039
ask us about stuff too we've covered it

2994
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:19,600
on previous shows but it might have been

2995
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:21,600
a year ago you know halfway through one

2996
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,280
of them yeah it could be three years ago

2997
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,800
it was me doing it solo and i think it's

2998
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:27,039
something me and natto covered it

2999
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:28,719
happens all the time now yeah so you

3000
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:29,840
know those things should go you know and

3001
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:32,158
it would basically be like a

3002
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,760
conversation starter and a place that

3003
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:36,879
people could go listen to something for

3004
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:39,360
5 or 10 or 15 minutes um and sort of get

3005
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:41,118
like this is the best we know and here's

3006
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:43,039
some educated guesses

3007
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:45,198
so like strain history

3008
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:46,560
story time and then maybe a third thing

3009
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,879
that i've been thinking about which is

3010
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,760
like uh gross styles

3011
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,480
uh

3012
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,400
and

3013
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:54,238
you know and trade-offs

3014
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:55,679
yeah what are you trying to do how are

3015
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,919
you trying to do it

3016
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,359
um a lot of people that are that that

3017
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,600
are trying to give grow knowledge or

3018
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:03,679
trying to sell a certain method

3019
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,840
or hydroponic nutrients or whatever it

3020
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:07,039
may be whatever it might be nutrients

3021
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,480
amendments

3022
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:10,960
biology

3023
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:12,238
you know a way of life

3024
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,000
and they want to convince you that if

3025
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:15,519
you just follow this path like you know

3026
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,279
christianity or [ __ ] whatever

3027
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,159
buddhism you know this will give you all

3028
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:21,920
the answers yes and life is rarely like

3029
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:23,039
that uh with growing there's a lot of

3030
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,239
trade-offs

3031
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:26,479
sure is

3032
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:29,279
you know and so not every growing style

3033
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:32,559
is is suitable for every growing

3034
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:34,639
um you know every growing goal

3035
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,679
yeah um hold on real quick people are

3036
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:37,199
asking if we have to change anything

3037
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:39,118
with patreon no there is no new one

3038
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:41,118
there is you don't have to do anything

3039
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:42,719
different the discord it kicks you

3040
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:44,960
automatically into it most people that

3041
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,800
are already a part of it already there

3042
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,800
if not you just go back to patreon and

3043
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,239
click connect to discord hit disconnect

3044
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,760
and then hit connect and it'll kick you

3045
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:54,000
into the room and that's it it's got to

3046
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,600
be a part of the patreon and we now have

3047
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,399
three different

3048
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,480
levels

3049
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:00,638
for patreon and the third one's a pretty

3050
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:02,479
cool one so go check that out too yeah

3051
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,639
and it's basically just like matt and i

3052
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:06,718
like taking full control

3053
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,600
yeah over the process

3054
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,319
you know

3055
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,800
um weed partnerships are hard yeah they

3056
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:15,359
are they can be very complicated

3057
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:18,880
complicated with two people so yeah and

3058
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:20,399
all that and so um so you know there's

3059
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,000

01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,880
all these dirty dirty dirty sex nights

3110
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:59,118
like i do every night

3111
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:01,440
you know matt is uh it's hard for matt

3112
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:03,279
to think about much else

3113
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:06,399
it's that face

3114
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:08,238
it just goes right back to it you know

3115
01:45:06,399 --> 01:45:10,079
it's mostly just trying to throw me off

3116
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:13,039
whatever i'm talking about and have me

3117
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:15,840
stutter and uh and stumble

3118
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:17,439
uh while he laughs he's uncrackable he's

3119
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:20,400
uncrackable i don't know if i'm

3120
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:22,238
uncrackable or anything like that

3121
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:23,519
but you know generally speaking

3122
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:26,238
um

3123
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:28,639
ethics and cannabis is weird provenance

3124
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,718
is weird because we come from

3125
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:34,319
uh you know a shady

3126
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:36,239
gray area illegals quasi-legal

3127
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:37,679
you know thing where it's basically just

3128
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:40,479
about your word

3129
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:41,920
and you know uh people were either there

3130
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:44,718
they weren't there

3131
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:47,679
and and so you know there's a lot

3132
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:50,319
we see a lot of scams yeah and one of

3133
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:53,600
the ways that matt has become so popular

3134
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:56,479
uh on instagram and other platforms

3135
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:59,280
is by trying to expose said scams

3136
01:45:56,479 --> 01:46:01,759
yeah that's more my my autism twinging

3137
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:04,158
though it just [ __ ] drives me nuts

3138
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:06,000
you know and so everybody that everybody

3139
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:07,039
that he tries to expose ends up hating

3140
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,719
him

3141
01:46:07,039 --> 01:46:09,840
and then that trail gets longer and

3142
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:10,840
longer

3143
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,840
they got an

3144
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:16,239
army an army of haters and then some of

3145
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:17,679
their fans end up becoming haters

3146
01:46:16,238 --> 01:46:19,118
um and so

3147
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:20,239
you know uh

3148
01:46:19,118 --> 01:46:22,960
we just want to give out real

3149
01:46:20,238 --> 01:46:24,718
information and you know two when it

3150
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,399
comes to the story time or when it comes

3151
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,600
to strain history or whatever it might

3152
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:29,519
be

3153
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,679
people think that we might be threatened

3154
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,520
by better information that comes out or

3155
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:36,960
more information that adds levels of

3156
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:38,639
detail or might change perspective

3157
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,399
not at all

3158
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:42,480
the whole point of all this stuff is to

3159
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:44,559
start conversations and to start people

3160
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:46,000
chattering and to start thinking and if

3161
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:48,639
people come out of the woodwork with

3162
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,800
verifiable information that makes the

3163
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:52,639
history deeper and richer

3164
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,560
like rather than being insulted that's

3165
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:56,800
cool yeah that's awesome i don't know

3166
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:58,320
that's that's to be you know so some

3167
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,960
people come out and it's like oh they're

3168
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:03,599
like oh you can prove i'm a liar

3169
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,840
no you're trying to tell stories from an

3170
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:08,000
inherently shadowy world

3171
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:10,560
yeah where not everyone agrees and

3172
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,319
people argue about everything yeah and

3173
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,320
you're trying to give some form of

3174
01:47:12,319 --> 01:47:16,079
reliable history

3175
01:47:14,319 --> 01:47:17,198
that's as close to what you can get as

3176
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:18,880
what you can get but there could have

3177
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:20,638
been somebody there that adds an angle

3178
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,800
to it that you didn't see

3179
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:24,639
yeah and so that's kind of what history

3180
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:26,239
is right it's like science you build on

3181
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,239
what you know

3182
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:30,000
and when something comes along to change

3183
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:31,839
part of what you know you add that into

3184
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,679
the fabric and keep going

3185
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:36,000
yeah so rather than being discrediting

3186
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:38,399
it's like it's it's a it's a chance to

3187
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,560
sort of like crowdsource

3188
01:47:38,399 --> 01:47:42,158
information

3189
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,080
that's at least how i see it

3190
01:47:42,158 --> 01:47:45,279
no i i definitely see it that way as

3191
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:47,920
well i mean

3192
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:50,399
uh if if info comes out we end up being

3193
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:52,319
wrong about something i'd much rather

3194
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,399
correct myself and be right than to

3195
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:56,319
continue to be wrong

3196
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:58,079
and i'm i'm much happier knowing more

3197
01:47:56,319 --> 01:47:59,759
info that's that's one of those things

3198
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:01,359
about being a nerd more info is great

3199
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,199
even if it's counter

3200
01:48:01,359 --> 01:48:04,960
you know to what you think

3201
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:06,719
yeah i mean like i you know i understand

3202
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:10,480
what everybody likes history until it

3203
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:12,480
bumps up against their prejudices yeah

3204
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:14,399
exactly you know science too you know

3205
01:48:12,479 --> 01:48:15,759
it's like if they prove something and it

3206
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:17,599
goes against your religion or your

3207
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:20,239
belief set or you're this you're that or

3208
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,440
whatever and you're like no

3209
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:25,279
you know

3210
01:48:21,439 --> 01:48:27,279
oh also before we get done um the all

3211
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:29,599
the websites are working writeseats.nl

3212
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:30,880
riot seedco.com and writeteach.com no

3213
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:34,159
matter which one it is it all takes you

3214
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:36,560
to the site after this on the the

3215
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:37,839
patreon discord discord patreon we're

3216
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:41,600
going to give this set of the canon

3217
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:42,880
bibles away to one lucky person

3261
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:07,198
