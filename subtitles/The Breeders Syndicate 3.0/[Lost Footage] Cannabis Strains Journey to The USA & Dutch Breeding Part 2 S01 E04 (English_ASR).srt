1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,139
yeah there's really good questions right

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,859
now

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,859
all right

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,960
good evening everyone welcome to Burrito

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,759
Syndicate I'm here with uh our other

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,019
host natto I don't even like calling you

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,939
a co-host because you're you're really

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,679
just the other host yeah the other host

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,079
indeed

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,858
all right so so today we're going to

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,059
cover

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,340
um uh cannabis Brewing as it was back in

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,079
the Dutch era mostly in pre-datch Era

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,780
and a little bit after and why it

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,000
matters today and how we apply that to

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,500
what we're working with today and to

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,259
start with that we're going to have to

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,000
go over some very basic breeding

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,799
um terminology just so you can

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,238
understand when we move on move forward

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,738
some of the people who haven't quite

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,779
gotten there yet can understand what

23
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,659
we're going to be talking about

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,299
so yeah let's kick it off dude all right

25
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,339
so uh we'll kick it off with you know

26
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,319
just to just to go over what Matt said

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,239
again we're gonna try to take you

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,519
through like some early days of reading

29
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,920
kind of up to what we've already done so

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,439
far which is like the the 80s Holland

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,079
era and that style and then we'll move

32
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,539
forward onto different stuff later

33
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,519
um but as far as terms go probably one

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,860
of the more

35
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,019
misused terms is F1 right we'll just

36
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,118
start there so start with F1 because

37
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,859
this has a lot of this is used

38
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,599
incorrectly in the Cannabis World daily

39
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,459
even by myself like I mean there's not

40
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,099
really another term to switch it out

41
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,379
with as we use it so sadly uh there's

42
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,478
almost no F ones

43
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,399
um yeah and the reason being is that

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,739
like what an F1 means is when you take

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,560
two parents that are pretty much true

46
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,819
breeding okay and you cross them

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,379
together

48
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,539
right

49
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,719
um let's you know that would result in

50
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,320
what was called an F1 where basically

51
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,539
all the dominant genes from both parents

52
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,578
will be dominant right and so you'll get

53
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,720
what's called hybrid Vigor because

54
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,279
you're not going to get any weird

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,280
recessives you're not going to get

56
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,478
anything like that you basically end up

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,459
with

58
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,818
um whatever the dominant genes are on

59
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,400
both sides that's what pops yeah right

60
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:16,979
so you know an example of that for

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,140
instance would be you know say something

62
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,780
like you know for our purposes like

63
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,839
skunk one by Haze or something like that

64
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,280
like or or skunk one by an NL or

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,719
something something along those lines

66
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,378
part of the reason why they use skunk

67
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,659
one so much was simply because it was it

68
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:35,519
was an easy way to F1 something right

69
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,259
well even even technically you want to

70
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,300
get more basic if you're doing F ones

71
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,818
it's like Afghani cross to tie right

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,239
sure because it has to be the definition

73
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:47,939
is two Crossing two parental line lines

74
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,039
with distinctively different genotypes

75
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,919
the most importantly which makes it more

76
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,479
rare so it's one of the most incorrect

77
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,639
terms

78
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,500
um because a lot of times it's used just

79
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,539
to say this is the first time someone's

80
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,080
crossed these two things and my

81
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,219
cushman's by Skittles F1 yeah right and

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,379
that and that and that's not right

83
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,439
because no those aren't like parental

84
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:14,280
stock from region of origin you know

85
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:17,039
um type of thing so F2 would be if you

86
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,680
take that F1 seed and you grow up males

87
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,019
than females and you cross them together

88
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,719
that's when with a line you should see

89
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,759
all the dominance all the recessives all

90
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,519
the various permutations of what's in

91
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,199
that line can pop up so instead of

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,219
getting like all the dominant traits

93
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,518
combined

94
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,859
you get every trait imaginable combining

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,080
in every way imaginable and most

96
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,819
importantly you'll see stuff that you

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,739
would not see in the F1 line stuff

98
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,359
cannot show up there are things that

99
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,239
will never show up in the F1 line that

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,220
will only show up F2 and absolutely yeah

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,039
to give it to give a really easy example

102
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,560
for people like in humans

103
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,539
um brown eyes is a dominant gene and so

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,658
in order to have blue eyes gray eyes

105
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:03,000
green eyes hazel eyes both parents have

106
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,679
to have that Gene and they have to line

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,900
up the two recessives

108
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,360
right so if one parent doesn't have the

109
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,239
gene it'll never pop

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,540
if that you know so exactly so anyway so

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,540
that's that's F1 F2 S1 is is a

112
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,099
relatively modern thing uh in terms of

113
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,040
people being able to do it but that's

114
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,419
basically it's a self one

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,000
um either through hermaphrodism

116
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,918
naturally or something human induced

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,399
from some kind of spray that's used in

118
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,139
modern terms you S1 the line it used to

119
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,019
be sort of frowned upon

120
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,060
but in uh in recent years because we

121
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:40,799
have a lot of cuts that we don't have

122
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,680
the line anymore we just have the

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,199
specific cut it might be the only way to

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,000
look through genetics in that line

125
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,280
besides

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,160
you know besides an outcross or a hybrid

127
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,779
of it right so it's not as good as as

128
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,520
doing uh because you'll get a lot of

129
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,198
weirdness when you end breed you could

130
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,939
get some undesirable things but at the

131
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,139
very least it gives you an idea to like

132
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:05,879
look through something like chemd or you

133
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,759
know Trinity or you know something

134
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,800
that's old that's an elite clone only

135
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,720
right yeah

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,540
um and then there's a thing called and

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,580
also in adding on to it was looked down

138
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,919
on it was only looked down on in the

139
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,719
Cannabis sphere in normal agriculture

140
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,698
selfing is the normal way to breed

141
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,380
uniform crops that's how they do it they

142
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,960
don't use filial Generations they go

143
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,839
through solving yes yes so that's so is

144
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,000
it cannabis kind of uh old wives tale as

145
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,099
it were and one of the one of the things

146
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,139
that happens with cannabis too is that

147
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,060
you know in modern agriculture when

148
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,439
you're developing a seed line you might

149
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,120
want a whole bunch of like butter

150
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,639
lettuce for instance that comes out

151
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,918
extremely similar and you might want a

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,199
bunch of seeds of whatever cucumbers or

153
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,538
zucchini or what what have you that

154
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,720
comes out extremely dependable and so

155
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:56,879
they will S1 that until they get you

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,840
know a very dependable very narrow

157
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,339
breeding uniform uniform not a lot to

158
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,859
look not you know that's part of the

159
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,839
reason why like you know and so IBL

160
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,879
maybe we'll shift it yeah this segues

161
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,339
into it because IBL is another like

162
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,699
super misused terms and it stands

163
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,439
essentially for inbred line yeah um but

164
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,120
and hold on hold on let me add this in

165
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,500
because this is the the point where most

166
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,079
people lose it

167
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,478
because it says inbred lying it does not

168
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,359
mean that if you line breed that you

169
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,939
have an IBL it is a very specific term

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,400
and it is a basically don't look at it

171
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,620
like okay well I crossed this F1 made

172
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,978
f2s that's IBL right it's line bread

173
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,500
it's inbred line it it basically what it

174
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:42,360
means is uniformity in a line and that's

175
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,300
it it's not something that can always be

176
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,160
achieved at F6 or f8 it only means when

177
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,740
you're popping those seeds you have a

178
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,199
homogeneous line meaning uniform like

179
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,759
clones so for us

180
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,680
um for you know for like large-scale

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,379
agriculture something like that might be

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,879
useful for cannabis it's not that useful

183
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,259
for the most part unless you get

184
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,959
something amazing because what you see

185
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,780
is what you get if you breed with an IBL

186
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,239
it'll throw what you see

187
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,279
it's very valuable in hemp Farms I I

188
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,500
know that that's one place where they're

189
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,119
liking seeing uniformity in self-blinds

190
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,740
because they just it's it's more

191
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,060
vigorous it's faster they can pop all

192
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,579
those seeds and if they come out uniform

193
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,620
that's even more that you it takes the

194
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,839
the cloning out of the you know out of

195
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,280
the picture and stuff so in in hemp I

196
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,019
can see that being more useful but in

197
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,399
modern cannabis people want to find that

198
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,139
that keeper

199
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,839
yeah they want they want a little bit of

200
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,240
variety so there's New Paths if for a

201
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,519
breeder for somebody like you know um

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,439
for a breeder or anything like that and

203
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,240
uh all that

204
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,800
getting something where like there's

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,379
nowhere to go within the gene pool

206
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,060
itself because it's an IBL and it

207
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,219
already is what it is the traits you see

208
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,720
are the traits you get yeah unless you

209
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,240
really want to add those traits to

210
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,160
another line specifically there's not a

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,139
lot of room for places to go

212
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,840
yeah because it's already been all that

213
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:02,280
variety has been bred out of it yeah so

214
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,659
that that's another thing with breeding

215
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,939
where it's like a lot of breeding

216
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,160
depends on what your goals are yeah you

217
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,019
know um depends on goals some people

218
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,120
might want consistency some people might

219
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,459
want like the same three to six phenos

220
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,560
to regularly pop some people might want

221
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,659
to breed an IBL some people might want

222
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,759
to do an open pollination or an F2 and

223
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,520
have the widest possible

224
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,199
gene pool to hunt through depending on

225
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,698
what your what your goals are you're

226
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
trying to find like a random Elite

227
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,900
cutting to hold on to are you trying to

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,459
actually breed a line like Matt was

229
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,259
saying where you could like put it in a

230
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,359
hemp field and start thousands of seeds

231
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:39,059
and get the same consistent you know

232
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,879
size Bush type of thing

233
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:45,958
so that's kind of the thing

234
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:47,759
um so uh we have is in Cross incross is

235
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,319
the last one we have left so in Cross is

236
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,819
the last one so can this is another

237
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,860
weird term because uh in um we call it a

238
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,180
BX

239
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,159
right yes

240
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:02,939
um but in most other breeding they call

241
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,740
it a BC a back cross is actually like

242
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,560
the technical term that you would use

243
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,620
but for for most cannabis people they're

244
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,518
mostly familiar with a BX and a BX is

245
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,500
simply

246
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,139
you take a cut

247
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,399
um you know and you use an outside

248
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:22,439
pollen donor uh to make a male line of

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,778
it and then you take the children of

250
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,899
that and you back cross it onto the

251
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:29,939
original female so we've talked about on

252
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,620
the previous on the previous podcast we

253
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,459
talked about how

254
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,240
um you know uh you know Neville used

255
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:40,979
um Seattle Greg's nl1

256
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,720
and uh you know would use that as a

257
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,940
pollen donor and would back cross to

258
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,240
make a pure hash plant to make a pure

259
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,899
big bud to make a pure nor uh Hawaiian

260
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,560
Indica that type of thing uh JJ from Top

261
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:58,500
Dog you know he took uh an Afghani one

262
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,359
and used that to cross into

263
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,700
um chemd and did that a few times and

264
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,740
made double dog and Trace dog and so on

265
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,920
and so forth so that's basically what a

266
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,720
BX is is you find a pollen donor and you

267
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,000
cross it to a clone only for the most

268
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,339
part and then you back crop you keep

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,720
back Crossing so on and so forth so

270
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,820
those are kind of like the lockdown

271
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,120
single traits when it's back Crossing

272
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,980
and then IX is going to be similar to a

273
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,539
BX but going further down the line and

274
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,899
Crossing back to a previous generation

275
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:29,338
so like maybe an F6 cross to an F1 of

276
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,139
the same line that would be an in Cross

277
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,160
because you're Crossing in between the

278
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,100
same line

279
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,860
but sure yeah so that it is essentially

280
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,899
still a back cross though so those yeah

281
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,379
those things are and and it's only it's

282
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,078
only a BX or a BC if you back cross it

283
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,120
to the exact same parent exactly that's

284
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,879
super important cutting like if you for

285
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,519
instance had like a line of chemd for

286
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,860
instance and you and you crossed your

287
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,740
children of that to a different chemd

288
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,419
parent it wouldn't be a BX yeah it has

289
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,919
to go directly back to the original

290
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,860
genetic

291
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,979
stock that started the process otherwise

292
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,778
it's it's not a BX so

293
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,820
um those are some basic terms I think

294
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:14,639
that covers like most yeah cannabis

295
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,140
people deal with and so we we thought

296
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,399
about like

297
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,078
um I don't know exactly you know how

298
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,879
much time we'll spend on each specific

299
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,039
topic but we thought about like it might

300
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,700
be interesting to

301
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,319
um

302
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,000
we thought it might be interesting to

303
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,459
talk about how we got here as far as

304
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,980
breeding techniques yeah I see in the

305
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,419
comments you know where we're going we

306
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,120
have to know where we came from I think

307
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:38,399
yeah exactly so

308
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,320
um you know the the easiest way you know

309
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,120
we won't we could spend an enormous

310
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,860
amount of time on how cannabis moved

311
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,259
around places

312
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,419
um but you know the basic premise is

313
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:49,860
that for most of the like what we

314
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,199
consider to be like the land race

315
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,120
regions right when people were starting

316
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,399
to get Imports into America they were

317
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,539
coming from Mexico

318
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:03,240
uh Colombia Panama Jamaica uh Thailand

319
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:05,939
Cambodia Laos

320
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,860
um you know those type of places uh and

321
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,500
they were importing seeded weed right

322
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,060
and so how do those Farmers how did

323
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,039
those farmers get to the point where

324
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,379
they were growing tons of cannabis and

325
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,539
exporting it to our region right

326
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,399
well basically it's at some point in the

327
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,919
past we don't need to spend a super

328
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,320
amount of time on this but you know

329
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,319
somewhere humans figured out that THC

330
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,200
had cool effects yeah they get [ __ ] up

331
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,600
you know by by a lot of by a lot of

332
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,399
people you know um you know humans

333
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,139
started interacting with plants and the

334
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,700
nature around them they started figuring

335
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,439
out which ones were good to eat which

336
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,720
ones were good for health which ones did

337
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,779
this which ones did that and so on a

338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,339
certain level there was a point where

339
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:49,139
um people figured out that you know

340
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,120
marijuana that you know the wild

341
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,060
marijuana strains had some effects

342
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,820
whether it was like hand rubbed Shiraz

343
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:58,259
uh making hashish by rubbing Buds and

344
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,940
then getting it on their hands and then

345
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,399
rubbing it off and smoking it or

346
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,440
consuming it or various aspects like

347
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,120
that people started to sort out that

348
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,519
this was a useful plant

349
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,259
right yeah and so like just every other

350
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,480
kind of useful plant from corn to

351
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:15,059
watermelons to anything else people

352
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,579
started messing with it to get more of

353
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:20,458
what they wanted yeah right and so we

354
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:24,778
what we think is is we think as as you

355
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:27,179
go from Wild populations right that um

356
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:29,519
that uh started that humans started

357
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:33,719
interacting with to planted populations

358
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,940
of cannabis by humans what we assume is

359
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,579
the traditional method is that people

360
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,760
would go out into these fields and they

361
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:43,739
would pick uh females that they like the

362
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,120
smell they like the structure they liked

363
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,159
whatever it was about it maybe they

364
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,078
liked it it had increased THC compared

365
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,539
to its neighbors sure and they would

366
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,099
keep those plants and then therefore

367
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,219
next year they would plant a bunch of

368
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,560
seeds from their favorite females yeah

369
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,379
right and so then over time year after

370
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,539
year generation after generation humans

371
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,799
started slowly improving their local

372
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,778
gene pool

373
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,778
and breeding it towards things they

374
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,799
wanted yeah maybe it was Terps back then

375
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:14,519
although they obviously wouldn't have

376
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,899
called it that Aromas effects weight you

377
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,639
know finished who knows different

378
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,980
Farmers I'm sure had vastly different

379
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,200
things but sure you know Farmers back

380
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,839
then seed collecting was part of the the

381
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,940
way they grew everything so you picked

382
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,760
your favorite plants they were seeded

383
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,700
and you grew that next year and then

384
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,519
over time uh humans started having a

385
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,259
massive impact on what kind of you know

386
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,600
what kind of plants were being grown

387
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,578
because they'd done this selection over

388
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,100
time over time over time and that pretty

389
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,620
much I think happened

390
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,019
um virtually everywhere uh anywhere that

391
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,060
cannabis was endemic sure yeah I mean

392
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,278
it's it's kind of not well known but

393
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,379
just really quickly they think that

394
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:59,519
cannabis sort of started in the Highland

395
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:01,198
areas around China Tibetan Plateau

396
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,078
um you know that kind of region it went

397
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,838
down into India it went down into

398
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:10,620
Pakistan and Afghanistan and about 2 700

399
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:13,860
years ago we have verifiable evidence

400
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,379
that the scythians who were like Central

401
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,560
Steppy people were using it in their

402
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:22,679
culture that it was being used in the

403
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:25,458
very Northern parts of Afghanistan and

404
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,919
in certain parts of the caucus mountains

405
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:32,458
and that also we've they found THC

406
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:37,099
burned in temples about 60 miles south

407
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:37,099
of Jerusalem about 2700 years ago

408
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:42,719
so right so there's so there's a

409
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,459
situation where obviously like we have

410
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,680
we don't know how long ago it started

411
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:51,958
but China and uh Tibet and the caucus

412
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,179
mountains and where Israel is right now

413
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,059
are obviously pretty far far apart from

414
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,859
each other especially from the way that

415
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,500
people got around at the time which was

416
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,379
you know camels horses donkeys Etc right

417
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:08,159
so it is so smoking and consuming either

418
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:10,799
hash or cannabis is at least 3 000 years

419
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,899
old documented in multiple spots yeah

420
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,778
probably goes back uh significantly

421
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,519
farther than that we just haven't found

422
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:20,698
absolute evidence that it occurred

423
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,100
sure um and so you know then you have

424
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:25,019
then you have a scenario in which

425
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,060
um so that's kind of how it starts start

426
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,679
starts up in Tibet and China area it

427
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:30,479
comes down into Pakistan India

428
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,698
Afghanistan it starts going into Iran

429
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,060
and the Middle East then it goes down

430
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,559
into uh into Africa

431
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,778
right yeah

432
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:44,958
um in Russia it turns into what becomes

433
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:48,360
known as ruderalis uh and um

434
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:52,739
so so then so then there's uh you know

435
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,500
the the weird part is the Americas right

436
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,759
is how it got to America uh it seems

437
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,799
like

438
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,778
um although this isn't 100 verified but

439
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,240
it seems like that most of the stuff

440
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:05,160
that ended up in America came along with

441
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,480
the Conquistadors and then later the

442
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,640
slave trade

443
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,798
uh it seems like a bunch of hemp hemp

444
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,919
was obviously used for most rope most

445
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,939
sales uh it was Sailors brought it with

446
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,100
them

447
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,959
um everywhere because it was like if you

448
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,698
got Shipwrecked or something you might

449
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,679
need to grow a crop of hemp to turn it

450
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:25,620
into sales or rope again so you could

451
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,740
get off your island or wherever you were

452
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:31,259
um so you know uh hemp was hemp was

453
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,058
critical to that era's

454
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,940
um trade and so it was kind of brought

455
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:40,259
everywhere so it seems like uh to Brazil

456
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,000
to the Caribbean to Mexico when they um

457
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,359
when they start talking about that kind

458
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,759
of thing genetically most cannabis from

459
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:51,538
those regions ties back to some kind of

460
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,940
African yeah right another weird thing

461
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:55,798
and uh there's there's not a lot of

462
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,538
evidence to back this up but the strange

463
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,298
thing is is when

464
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,339
they did genetic work on Panamanian and

465
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:06,779
Colombian

466
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:08,759
that has to tie back to uh

467
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:11,759
um to Southeast Asia

468
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,798
yeah okay which is weird and so I only

469
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,058
have like one little tidbit on that and

470
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:18,599
it has nothing to do with cannabis

471
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:21,240
necessarily but obviously at some point

472
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,939
um if that if it's true in the genetics

473
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,579
of Panama and Colombia tie back to more

474
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,558
southeast Asia region then somehow it

475
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:31,259
had to get from there to to from

476
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,599
Southeast Asia to the Western half of

477
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,940
South America right yeah and so there's

478
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,798
essentially two options either it

479
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,679
happened once the Spanish and others

480
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:43,379
started trading with the East uh after

481
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:46,019
the conquests or there's another

482
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,460
interesting thing where there's Pacific

483
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,079
Islanders

484
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,960
and some others that they've done

485
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,819
genetic testing on in Southeast Asia and

486
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,400
some of these islands where they have

487
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:59,460
discovered pre-columbian

488
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,640
um Indian people's DNA

489
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:07,019
uh in these Pacific Islanders from about

490
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,780
11 or 1200 A.D oh wow so we know for a

491
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:12,240
fact because they interbred they had

492
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,178
babies with them they implanted some of

493
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,980
their DNA from

494
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:20,460
pre-columbian peoples into Pacific

495
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,440
Islanders and so we know for a fact that

496
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,440
hundreds of years three four hundred

497
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,320
years perhaps before uh Columbus sailed

498
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,600
and discovered and rediscovered uh the

499
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,819
Caribbean and Americas

500
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,579
um there was some kind of trade or at

501
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:38,220
least inner relationships between the

502
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:40,139
Pacific Islanders and the Panamanian and

503
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,480
Colombian peoples

504
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,120
um and we know if people are [ __ ]

505
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,200
they're probably smoking yeah and and

506
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:51,538
since we know that that happens was

507
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,880
absolutely was absolutely required for

508
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:55,558
sailing uh it makes sense that it

509
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,299
theoretically could have been required

510
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,879
for sailing

511
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:01,679
um back then and they they traded some

512
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,299
of these pre-columbian indigenous

513
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,100
peoples that were sailing out to the

514
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:07,679
Pacific Islands

515
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:09,240
um they traded them some seeds and the

516
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,038
seeds would be necessary on both ports

517
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,660
if they're going both places and so

518
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,579
that's not proof we have guaranteed

519
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,679
proof that they were interbreeding an

520
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,480
1100 A.D because the way DNA and

521
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,640
genetics works so we know that there was

522
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,579
trade ongoing

523
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,679
um we don't know exactly when but it

524
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:28,500
does seem like Colombian and Panamanian

525
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,600
tie in somehow to the southeast Asia

526
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,140
portion of the gene pool not the African

527
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:36,779
where Mexican Jamaican the island weed

528
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,179
uh the stuff that's on the Eastern side

529
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:42,960
of South America that all seems to come

530
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:44,519
from African origins search makes sense

531
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,980
because there wasn't just a mammoth

532
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,740
amount of trade both slave and otherwise

533
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,579
coming over from all portions of Africa

534
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,079
over to the new world yeah right and so

535
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:58,079
we know some of it was introduced then

536
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,119
it's entirely possible that that some of

537
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,038
it was introduced earlier I mean you

538
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,678
know some of this some of this stuff is

539
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,720
not poorly poorly you know documents

540
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,000
poorly documented for lack of a better

541
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,579
term uh you know the Conquistadors

542
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,259
burned most of the writings of the

543
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:14,519
Mayans and the Aztecs and the other

544
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,740
peoples because they thought they were

545
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,019
devil works so most of their knowledge

546
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,620
was sort of lost so who knows maybe they

547
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:26,879
even had it down uh and we just don't

548
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:28,379
know so you fast forward again and you

549
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,080
have these various people in these

550
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,720
various regions that are improving their

551
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,819
own genetic stock the people in Thailand

552
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,640
the people in Lao the people in Mexico

553
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:41,158
the people in Colombia they're growing

554
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,080
their stock they are working with what

555
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,840
them and other local farmers in their

556
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,519
area have access to right and they're

557
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,899
breeding it every year and that's where

558
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:54,179
all of these varietals kind of came from

559
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,940
obviously it was all seeded weed

560
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,860
um you know there was uh you know and

561
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,779
there was two distinct cultures going on

562
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,959
too right maybe we should mention this

563
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:06,599
so in the North Indian Pakistan and

564
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Afghanistan regions it was primarily a

565
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:12,000
hashish culture so they viewed the plant

566
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,860
as essentially I don't want to say the

567
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,500
beater it's garbage but they viewed it

568
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:19,259
as a way to get a hold of the trichomes

569
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,700
yeah whether they did hand rub like I

570
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,038
was talking about or whether they did

571
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,240
dry sift or whatever method they used to

572
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,460
extract it

573
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,940
they thought that the proper use of

574
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,460
cannabis was to turn it into hash yeah

575
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:36,058
um you know and so but then you go to

576
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,340
Lao or Cambodia or Thailand or Mexico or

577
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:40,158
Colombia these kind of places they

578
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:43,500
smoked flour

579
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,520
so you had some groups breeding for

580
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,679
specific basically hash plants right and

581
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,240
then you had some groups breeding for

582
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,559
smokable flower

583
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,900
yeah

584
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,000
right and those were the kind of those

585
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,220
were the kind of selections that people

586
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,220
were making back then right

587
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,919
and then you know uh obviously like

588
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,259
America's founded on capitalistic

589
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,179
principles right and so if there's a

590
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:12,658
demand somewhere and there's a supply

591
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:15,360
somewhere else Adam Smith says that the

592
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,460
Invisible Hand should come along and get

593
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:21,119
the supply from where it is to where the

594
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,038
demand is right so you have all these

595
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,779
regions that we've talked about have

596
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,279
been probably improving their crops a

597
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,200
year to year they're saving their best

598
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,000
seed like they do with their food crops

599
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,100
they're slowly improving their genetic

600
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,839
lines but there's really not a lot of

601
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:36,178
interaction between them and other

602
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:39,000
groups they're kind of growing what's

603
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,620
available in their area except except

604
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,380
for the one thing we we had talked about

605
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:46,379
I believe it's referenced in Rob Clark's

606
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,940
hashish book except in Afghanistan where

607
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,720
they were importing they had learned the

608
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,360
trade of uh of of hand rubbing and hash

609
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,980
collecting via the route from India so

610
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,158
most of the stuff during that time they

611
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,679
were importing Indian uh more sativity

612
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,600
tight narrow Leaf varieties to

613
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,860
Afghanistan because that's what the

614
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,259
Indians were using to make their hash

615
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:09,240
and they weren't using their afghanis in

616
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:12,179
their fields yet they they weren't using

617
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,259
those to get the trichomes collect and

618
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,880
make the hash they were actually using

619
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,298
Indian sativas during that time and it

620
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,220
wasn't until more modern uh the past

621
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,319
1950 when they started using and

622
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,940
collecting their own varieties so maybe

623
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,158
a better way to more accurate way to

624
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,480
State it would just say that like we

625
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,120
can't discount that there was some

626
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,279
Regional trading going on sure right

627
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,019
between say you know India Pakistan

628
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:35,759
Afghanistan they're all connected to one

629
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,798
another you can kind of go back and

630
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,359
forth

631
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,099
there could be Panamanian and Colombian

632
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,819
going back and forth there could be some

633
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,798
Caribbean exchanges but in general there

634
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,859
wasn't Caribbean trading with Thailand

635
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,379
yeah with Afghanistan there wasn't like

636
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,839
different regions of the world the

637
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,760
regions themselves mixed a bit you know

638
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,319
it's obviously not written down so it's

639
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,980
really hard to determine with any kind

640
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:04,319
of factual basis how it exactly occurred

641
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,140
um but you have all these over all

642
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:10,439
hundreds of years by the time that like

643
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,840
America gets involved you have all these

644
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,519
uh weed cultures

645
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,918
that have developed around the world

646
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,379
some of them are hash cultures some of

647
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,940
them are smokeable flower cultures so

648
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,640
obviously they made different decisions

649
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,340
on their strains based on

650
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,020
uh you know whether they wanted to smoke

651
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:31,619
flour or whether they wanted to to

652
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,900
create a hash plant sure um and you know

653
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:36,479
prohibition was was fully going on in

654
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,940
America and

655
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,140
um you know invisible hand comes in and

656
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,140
there's a bunch of people in America

657
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,179
that want to smoke pot

658
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,679
musicians jazz artists

659
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:51,179
um hippies uh counterculture beatnix

660
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:55,019
various various types of people get

661
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:56,640
introduced to it most likely Mota uh

662
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,639
probably most people's first experiences

663
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,080
with it were probably Mexican

664
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,820
coming into the country

665
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,980
there was a lot of you know back and

666
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:06,960
flow over the Border uh with Mexican

667
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,460
like you know Farm working and stuff

668
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,740
like that they probably brought it with

669
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,440
them there's definitely records of of

670
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,859
famous jazz people smoking it in the 20s

671
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,240
and 30s looking at jazz cabbage yeah you

672
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,058
know I mean obviously it was it was a

673
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,220
big enough issue that uh they decided to

674
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:25,678
do some crazy Prohibition in the late

675
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,798
1930s

676
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,298
um up till that point and uh so

677
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,400
so then you have a situation where you

678
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:35,339
start hitting like what matters to most

679
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,720
people I think uh with with this way

680
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:39,859
that we've kind of brought ourselves to

681
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,100
here is that various entrepreneurs

682
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:47,339
decided to start sourcing weed from

683
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:49,139
various countries that grow weed and

684
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,778
figure out a way to get it into America

685
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,360
and sell it for a high dollar to

686
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:57,000
American people and the difference in

687
00:26:54,359 --> 00:27:00,899
profit between buying it from a Thai

688
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,259
farmer to selling it to a guy that lives

689
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,298
in Venice Beach was extremely high yeah

690
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:08,700
so there was a lot of economic incentive

691
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:11,700
for these people to start figuring out

692
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,620
ways to smuggle it into the country and

693
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,538
and feed the demand

694
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:19,979
right yes and so uh sadly uh one thing

695
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:21,538
that was so we start getting Imports

696
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,400
right we start getting

697
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:25,980
we start getting Imports and we start

698
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,200
getting things from uh Panama people

699
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,298
start smuggling from Panama and Colombia

700
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,640
people certainly start smuggling from

701
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:36,279
Jamaica and other Caribbean islands

702
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,679
Mexico Hawaii

703
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,839
[Music]

704
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,940
um you know Asia there's some pretty

705
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:45,418
famous Smugglers that were working in

706
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,460
Thailand and Cambodia and Lao in the 60s

707
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,740
and they start you know all the famous

708
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:54,900
stuff you've heard about uh Colombian

709
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:56,519
gold Panama Red Thai sticks every every

710
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,700
um I'm sure Matt can think of some

711
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:03,000
others there's a bunch of them

712
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:05,819
Jamaican Lambs bread uh you know Holly

713
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,500
from from you know Mexican

714
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:10,439
um you know Mexican stuff was generally

715
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,859
named by region you had Michoacan you

716
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,900
had oaxacan you had this you had Baron

717
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,719
yeah you had various things and that's

718
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,460
kind of like those were the first names

719
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,860
that you would get

720
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,419
um you know the very first names of weed

721
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:27,658
was like where it's from

722
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:30,200
and maybe some nickname like maybe maybe

723
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:33,659
then maybe they dried Colombian gold

724
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,700
into a brownish gold color and then

725
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,799
there was Panamanian red and it had red

726
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,600
hair or there was this and you know they

727
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,599
wrapped they wrapped in Thailand they

728
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:45,058
wrapped the loose buds around sticks to

729
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,519
make it like a more these go from like a

730
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:49,678
super leafy hermaphroditic loose flowers

731
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,839
and they'd pack them tight to make it

732
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,179
into something and you get Thai stick

733
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,220
and so all the original names they're

734
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,778
not really strain names they're like

735
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,940
this is where it's from

736
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:02,099
and this is its nickname that we gave to

737
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,500
it from where it's from possibly a color

738
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,259
or smell or some other attribute yeah

739
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:10,558
yeah you know or rhyme

740
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,179
yeah right Maui Wowie yeah exactly they

741
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:16,139
guaranteed picked it because it rhymed

742
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:17,940
yep that was that's the reason right and

743
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,980
so you know

744
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,080
um and so that's when so that's when

745
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,659
like the the breeding that everybody is

746
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,418
familiar with kind of starts

747
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:31,440
yeah right you've got all this seeded

748
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,899
weed coming into America from all these

749
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,500
regions I named southeast Asia the

750
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:40,079
Caribbean uh Mexico America uh you know

751
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,720
South America that type of thing and as

752
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,240
you know I mean for the younger cats out

753
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,720
there you know I used to sit there with

754
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,940
my head down and a tray at an angle and

755
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,860
you would break your weed up here

756
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,679
right and then that allowed all the

757
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:57,298
seeds to roll down the tray and collect

758
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,000
at the bottom lip of the tray as you

759
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:01,619
broke up all your herb right and then

760
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,839
you'd have a bunch of fluffed up herb

761
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:06,538
for a bowl or a bong or rolling a joint

762
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:09,839
or something along those lines right

763
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:12,179
um and so everybody got free seeds

764
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,220
right free seeds we weren't really too

765
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,019
much we weren't really too much of a

766
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,778
hash culture and that's part of the

767
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:21,240
reason why and then also hash is is

768
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:23,819
trichomes separated from the flower and

769
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,859
and the such so everything that was

770
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,319
coming into America at first was various

771
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:31,139
kinds of sativas yes

772
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,220
because the sativas were the buds you

773
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,419
know yeah and if you were getting

774
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:38,940
imported Afghan Afghani Indica hash you

775
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,559
were getting blocks of hash yeah you

776
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,360
weren't getting Afghani Bud like that

777
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,359
important yeah it didn't come with free

778
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,459
seats yeah yeah there's no seats no

779
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,099
there was sometimes the random seed

780
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,600
didn't break a half stamp there the

781
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,538
random button I mean there's a famous

782
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:57,719
actually uh there's some serious debate

783
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:59,778
in Europe over uh over there's two camps

784
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,759
basically on the on the White Widow Camp

785
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:03,898
there's uh you know uh just so and the

786
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,419
only reason why I bring that up is

787
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:08,519
because there's a guy over there ingmar

788
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:10,620
uh and one of the one of the stories

789
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,418
about how white widow happened is like

790
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,759
the founding part of white widow is he

791
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:18,778
was breaking up a block of imported hash

792
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:22,019
and some seeds fell out yeah and he got

793
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:24,538
an original Afghan from some region out

794
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:25,859
of that block of seats yeah so it was

795
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:26,640
rare

796
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:28,619
um

797
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,200
you know there was some hash being

798
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:33,359
imported into America but like I said

799
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,000
you know it uh it didn't come with free

800
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,619
seats yeah where um there was no

801
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,960
seedless in any of these other regions

802
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,178
so all the sativas that we were

803
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,298
importing came with 3C

804
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:46,919
yes and that free seed is the start of

805
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:49,558
every famous breeder you ever heard of

806
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,320
Journey yes for the most for the most

807
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:55,200
yeah it really is yeah it is so people

808
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,759
start smoking weed right people start

809
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,058
liking the weed

810
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:02,278
and then some people have get the idea I

811
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:04,798
have these seeds I wonder what would

812
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:07,558
happen if I started growing my own weed

813
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,879
right and then there's places uh some of

814
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,220
them are pretty famous the Emerald

815
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,860
Triangle Trinity County Humboldt County

816
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,100
Mendocino County where I live

817
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:20,339
um the Central Coast San Francisco uh

818
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:21,199
Santa Cruz area of Bakersfield yeah of

819
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:24,720
California

820
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,319
legendarily you know basically anywhere

821
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,538
where it was mountainous smoked

822
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,240
people weren't going to find it

823
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:34,558
and the climate was cool I'm not saying

824
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,120
people weren't doing it in other parts

825
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,278
of the country because of course they

826
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,500
were but

827
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:41,940
uh you know wherever people could start

828
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,980
to get away with it with their with

829
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,380
their Imports they start growing it yeah

830
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,120
and meccas were built and Mecca's will

831
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,320
build and then the only reason why I

832
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:51,298
brought up those regions is because

833
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,519
enough people in those regions all

834
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:55,278
decided to start doing it that it

835
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,379
started the beginnings of American

836
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,359
growing culture sure right if you're

837
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,880
growing in Upstate New York or Oklahoma

838
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,500
or Florida or some [ __ ]

839
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,200
um you're probably trying to keep it

840
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,700
pretty small yeah you know there was

841
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,620
definitely some stuff with hippies and

842
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,200
Santa Cruz and Mendocino County and

843
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,579
Central Coast and different areas that

844
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,740
um they were a little bit more open with

845
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:18,839
each other uh and so there was a little

846
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,640
bit more trading going on and a little

847
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,740
bit more of a culture started to develop

848
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,240
whereas some of the other more harsh

849
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,759
police state regions of the United

850
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,798
States uh that were a lot more populated

851
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,579
it was a lot more secretive and you know

852
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,798
circles were even smaller right sure so

853
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:38,339
you know people start growing seed

854
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:41,398
probably with varying success and

855
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:43,678
they start discovering stuff

856
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:46,018
right they start discovering that when

857
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,298
you grow Thai and you grow Colombian boy

858
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:51,058
is it hard to finish in America yeah

859
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:53,460
very you know the stuff wants to go till

860
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:54,918
December or January or whether it

861
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,380
doesn't go that long

862
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:00,120
people start having issues with getting

863
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,440
you know because if you could grow weed

864
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,479
from the seed then you could get free

865
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,159
weed yeah and you wouldn't have to be

866
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,259
buying it what does this free weed look

867
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,960
like when it hasn't been compressed and

868
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:13,199
bailed and shipped from you know

869
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,720
International locations what would it be

870
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:19,678
like if you got it fresh so yeah the

871
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,299
initial success for people was

872
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,280
um you know people people could get the

873
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,440
Mexicans to finish

874
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,359
because the Mexicans typically were

875
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,760
farther away from the equator and they

876
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,378
were a little shorter right and they had

877
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,839
significant struggles getting the

878
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:35,460
Colombian and the Panama and the and the

879
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,519
ties and the different stuff like that

880
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,139
to finish right yeah so this this is

881
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,300
where people start to get the idea of

882
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,240
like I got some Thai stick or I got some

883
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,419
Colombian gold and I got some oaxacan

884
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,699
right and what happens if I grow them up

885
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:53,098
and I cross them

886
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:55,199
yeah that's that's basically the start

887
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:57,300
of American breeding that's the that's

888
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,399
the the honest to God that's the start

889
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,320
of how everybody in America started

890
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,019
breeding things right and I'm not going

891
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,180
to say America is unique but it is rare

892
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,880
in the sense that America is the plate

893
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:11,639
or one of the places where for the first

894
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,220
time in hundreds of years people started

895
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:16,440
Crossing these wildly different Gene

896
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:17,399
pools from these different regions

897
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,079
together

898
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,480
yes

899
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,920
right um I think I think the way you put

900
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,539
it the other night and I wrote it down

901
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,579
because it was it was worded very well

902
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,139
whoever and wherever the weed was

903
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:29,820
becoming imported the most that's where

904
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:33,000
the weed was Blended together the first

905
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,519
time right and that's that's well put

906
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,880
and so you know

907
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,500
um and so there's so so yeah so

908
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,720
basically

909
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,338
um you know there's uh you know there's

910
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,899
some pretty famous stuff that started

911
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:46,980
happening then

912
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,480
um people started getting these

913
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,760
different these different things they

914
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,579
started breeding them together

915
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,579
um they started experimenting with stuff

916
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,619
um in the San Francisco Bay area and in

917
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:02,039
Santa Cruz and stuff like what became

918
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:04,380
known as Hayes started which according

919
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,779
to Sam and others was essentially

920
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,500
Colombian by Colombian

921
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,540
um

922
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,739
you know and uh but you needed a

923
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:12,838
greenhouse

924
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:14,338
you needed you they figured with some of

925
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,440
these some of these land races you

926
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,320
needed to grow it in a mild climate

927
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,079
which the central coast and uh the Bay

928
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,700
Area definitely had and you needed you

929
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,740
needed some way to protect it from the

930
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:27,299
weather and give it maybe some heat or

931
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:30,598
some whatever and and

932
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,940
finish it right so they start Crossing

933
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,440
things yeah one of the famous people

934
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:38,519
that started Crossing things is a guy

935
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,380
named Rob Clark right yes uh Rob has

936
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:42,960
some very famous stuff that he did he

937
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,480
started Crossing Colombians and Mexicans

938
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,820
uh because Mexicans finished quite

939
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,858
faster and so he was trying to get the

940
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,660
qualities of the two and get something

941
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:52,920
that would finish in California

942
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:55,799
yeah right

943
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,838
and so they start breeding obviously Sam

944
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,579
Skunk Man is breeding obviously there's

945
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,500
other various people that are popping

946
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,140
and doing all kinds of stuff a lot of

947
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,940
the the oldest and most legendary names

948
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,858
that we know

949
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,980
are from this era

950
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:13,019
sure from this like pioneer take some

951
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,639
Thai take some Cambodian cross them

952
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,619
together cross it with some Colombian

953
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,440
cross it with some Mexican cross it with

954
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,880
some this cross some Jamaican buy this

955
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,200
you know trade some seeds with your

956
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,920
friend

957
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:29,460
um and you know uh so that's kind of

958
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,838
like the start of like uh cannabis

959
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,619
growing in America

960
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:38,338
yes on any kind of scale and so even

961
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:40,079
when I started in the early 90s

962
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:41,880
um I still have them some over there

963
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,579
there's I got like three books that I

964
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,400
bought uh knowledge was extremely

965
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:49,560
limited there was no internet there was

966
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,200
no forums there was no forums to confuse

967
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,059
you yeah no and so and so even for me in

968
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:55,319
the 90s think about how difficult it

969
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:57,719
must have been

970
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,359
um for the people in the 70s that had

971
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,799
even less knowledge oh I'm sure because

972
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:03,059
one of the things I'll hold it up right

973
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,680
now one of the things that taught me

974
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:06,119
breeding

975
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:09,858
was this

976
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,780
the Bible this is the Bible uh Rob Clark

977
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:15,598
took his experience with growing a bunch

978
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:19,380
of weed and breeding a bunch of weed and

979
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,260
he figured out how marijuana grows how

980
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,119
it breeds how it triggers how all the

981
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,060
different traits the different traits

982
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,180
and he wrote this I mean that's right he

983
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:32,460
wrote sort of a Bible yeah right he

984
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:35,159
wrote a basic Bible so when I started

985
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,980
out I was able to buy this Bible

986
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,838
when I got interested in weed and I was

987
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,900
able to read this book over and over and

988
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:46,679
over again and it taught me a ton about

989
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:49,200
how to grow cannabis yeah I'm sure Matt

990
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,358
had the same experience most readers

991
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,980
most breeders that get curious about

992
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,319
breeding

993
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,760
um you've read Rob Clark's book yeah if

994
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,800
you hear a seed maker and you actually

995
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,380
are passionate and want to learn and

996
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,180
make things better you almost everyone

997
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,980
eventually runs into Rob Clark's work

998
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:07,019
and eventually I think with the breeder

999
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,740
Syndicate thing one of the plans is to

1000
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:14,099
do for patreon a course based on uh

1001
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:15,838
cannabis Evolution and ethnobotany uh

1002
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,220
Rob Clark gave us his permission to use

1003
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,139
that for a course so I thought that

1004
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,578
would be pretty cool to do yeah and so

1005
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:22,500
he I mean I don't need to go through all

1006
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:25,380
of it but he started talking about the

1007
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,260
differences in latitude and you know

1008
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,000
finish times and the differences in the

1009
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,579
various kinds of cannabis and regions

1010
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,159
and what to expect from them how to make

1011
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,500
seed how to make seed mature like really

1012
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:40,259
like and so you know he deserves an

1013
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,838
enormous amount of credit sure uh

1014
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,400
because I'm sure there was an enormous

1015
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,858
amount of fuckups

1016
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,740
yeah in order to learn reading when

1017
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:51,598
breeding is 90 [ __ ] ups there was uh

1018
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:53,699
there was a there was a but you know

1019
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,740
they had to learn all that and they had

1020
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:58,379
they had to put that down into some kind

1021
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:01,379
of information base and I'm sure his

1022
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,519
journey to learn was significantly

1023
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,680
harder

1024
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,800
uh than the people that came after it oh

1025
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:10,618
I'm sure because there was no books for

1026
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,000
him to buy exactly right I mean I don't

1027
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,358
think there was any cannabis books in

1028
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,059
the 60s and you know um there was not

1029
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,219
breeding I mean in the 70s it sort of

1030
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:22,799
exploded a little bit

1031
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:25,500
um Steve Murphy uh who we've talked

1032
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,300
about Murphy Stevens Murphy Stevens it

1033
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,358
was his pen name but you know the

1034
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:33,780
gentleman that gave the Afghani seeds to

1035
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:35,699
uh Seattle uh Greg uh which he used to

1036
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,359
to create what we know as Northern

1037
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:41,059
Lights uh he wrote some I think like by

1038
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:45,480
74

1039
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:47,880
73 74-ish he had some books out uh Mel

1040
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,880
Frank and Ed Rosenthal started

1041
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,519
contributing some stuff uh there was uh

1042
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,220
since Mella tips

1043
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,199
um there was High Times

1044
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:59,699
uh there was various other magazine

1045
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,618
there's all kinds yeah there was all

1046
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:03,719
kinds of things so people started the

1047
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:06,720
70s is where all of a sudden there

1048
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:09,179
starts to be like um information coming

1049
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,239
out that people can access and they

1050
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:14,219
don't have to like learn from scratch

1051
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,679
or what their neighbor knows or what

1052
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:21,059
their buddy that got them into it knows

1053
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:24,598
yeah right and uh and so and so you know

1054
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:27,000
Rob uh Rob did things like Rob crossed

1055
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,760
Colombian and Mexican

1056
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
right Robin and Sam scope man are

1057
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,839
friends you know skunk one is

1058
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,239
Afghan by Colombian Mexican yep you know

1059
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,980
they start blending things

1060
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:42,838
um longer things with shorter things

1061
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,639
they start playing they start looking to

1062
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:47,219
see can I get the traits of this Mexican

1063
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,199
with the traits of this Colombian can I

1064
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:52,439
get this tie to stop herming and not

1065
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,598
take seven months yeah I uh can I this

1066
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,700
it's a bad structure to the tie

1067
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:00,119
different structure all that type of

1068
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:02,759
stuff and so you know and then

1069
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,480
um so people so people start

1070
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,660
um

1071
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,179
uh Crossing these things right and so

1072
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:11,219
maybe this is a good time so that that's

1073
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:12,539
what's really happening in the I don't

1074
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:14,098
know exactly when it started happening

1075
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:16,320
in the 60s

1076
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:18,539
um but it definitely was happening in

1077
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,838
the 60s to some degree it accelerated

1078
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:24,059
greatly in the 70s one second I'm just

1079
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,619
gonna chime in um Greg actually said I

1080
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,480
studied Luther Burbank and then bought

1081
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:30,300
all of Rob's books Burbank worked with

1082
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,000
cannabis in California yeah so there you

1083
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:35,220
go even even somebody like Greg who's I

1084
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,980
consider to be in a very early Pioneer

1085
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:40,379
oh yeah doing a lot of stuff uh Rob's

1086
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:42,599
work helped him you know

1087
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,519
um and so that's kind of and that's

1088
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,338
that's also a theme that I'd like to say

1089
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,838
uh you know right now is that and this

1090
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:51,119
remains true no matter what episode

1091
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:54,119
we're gonna chat about is that every

1092
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,920
single breeder out there stands on the

1093
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,920
shoulders of the people that came before

1094
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,659
them whether it's whether it's the seeds

1095
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,960
and the genetics they have access to

1096
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:06,420
whether it's the forums or books or

1097
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,639
Knowledge from older cats there was a

1098
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,099
wave of pioneers that really figured it

1099
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,318
out and that every generation after that

1100
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:16,619
every Group after that they got to take

1101
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:18,719
their work in genetics and improve it or

1102
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,519
mess it up you know as the case maybe it

1103
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:21,899
was it depending on your opinion right

1104
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:23,400
yeah but they also got a bunch of

1105
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,800
knowledge by the time a lot of you guys

1106
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,619
on this that are listening got into it

1107
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,480
there was probably forums you could go

1108
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,700
there was breeding forums I mean you go

1109
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,679
on the breeding Forum of overgrow and

1110
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:36,838
there's Sam Skunk Man and Chimera and

1111
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,639
people that have a lot of knowledge you

1112
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:40,980
start reading that

1113
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,719
um and you know the internet books

1114
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,400
started putting the knowledge out there

1115
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,759
in a way for people to really access

1116
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,440
which really sped up the time it took

1117
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,020
you know

1118
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,780
um you know on uh I mean on a previous

1119
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:57,239
interview uh that you know Greg's on

1120
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,220
this when when Matt interviewed Greg I

1121
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,739
mean Greg spoke about you know they got

1122
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:04,559
some Afghan beans uh that were extremely

1123
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:07,139
limited from uh Steve Murphy and they

1124
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,000
crossed them to themselves and then they

1125
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:12,000
basically crossed them with every sativa

1126
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,358
they knew of yeah Hawaiians Colombians

1127
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,699
ties you know lots of Mexicans lots of

1128
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,440
Mexicans lots of this lots of that they

1129
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:21,539
were just everybody was just playing

1130
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,400
around with and that's the other part

1131
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,739
that people need to know right is that

1132
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,059
nobody knew what an Afghan by a Mexican

1133
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:30,358
would look like

1134
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:32,099
yeah it hadn't happened not yet we knew

1135
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:33,539
what Colombian by Mexican would look

1136
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:36,240
like because that hadn't happened either

1137
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:38,579
so a lot of these Pioneers they're

1138
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,078
taking you know Rob's like I wonder if I

1139
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:42,359
took Colombian and Mexican and crossed

1140
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,519
it what does that look like yeah you

1141
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:46,858
know and then maybe later on when skunk

1142
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:49,920
one is born Sam is like hey I got access

1143
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:52,679
to some Afghans Let's cross this Afghan

1144
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,900
into your skunk into your you know your

1145
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,759
Colombian Mexican maybe that'll shorten

1146
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,960
it up even earlier and it'll be done in

1147
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,060
October

1148
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,338
and this and I think this is a good

1149
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:05,400
segue into talking about how breeding

1150
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:07,318
for uh just to see what happens

1151
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,119
um turned into breeding for traits as

1152
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:10,858
they learn these traits as they as they

1153
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,480
saw you know this one's purple this one

1154
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:14,639
smells like watermelon this one smells

1155
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,740
like cereal they started learning well

1156
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,019
if we combine these traits you know

1157
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,939
let's let's see if we can get this trait

1158
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:23,818
to pop out if we cross this and this and

1159
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:26,159
they started going and actually having a

1160
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:27,659
purpose for breeding uh with cannabis

1161
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:29,399
and finding out that there were these

1162
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,318
traits that they could follow long

1163
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,440
flowering short flowering colors smell

1164
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:37,559
taste hi all of it and it went from

1165
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,260
seeing what can happen to a real purpose

1166
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,659
a real purpose yes and so I think

1167
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,020
probably the two traits in the beginning

1168
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:48,539
the people were after was I like the way

1169
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:51,480
this weed tastes and smokes

1170
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:53,940
it won't finish where I live yeah how do

1171
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,880
I get it to finish where I live because

1172
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,280
a lot of this stuff like Panamanian uh

1173
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,500
Colombian the Southeast Asian stuff is

1174
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,200
all very near the equator takes a long

1175
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,880
time uh America is not particularly near

1176
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:07,618
the equator

1177
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,260
um you know so they had to figure out

1178
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:12,960
how do I blend stuff to get the stuff I

1179
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,420
like and be able to grow it in my region

1180
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,059
yeah right and obviously there's a big

1181
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,159
Financial incentive in that too right

1182
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:22,199
because you don't have to import it it

1183
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,000
doesn't have to come through customs and

1184
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:25,618
that's kind of where green Bud was born

1185
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,559
yes

1186
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:30,000
right uh you know the way that most of

1187
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,500
these traditional cultures they didn't

1188
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,539
have air-conditioned dry rooms or

1189
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,400
anything like that a lot of them dried

1190
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:38,818
hanging in the woods a lot of them dried

1191
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,780
in the Sun a lot of them dried it and

1192
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:42,900
then

1193
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:45,480
key load it right and then it begins to

1194
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,519
ferment and it gets wrapped up in

1195
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,219
plastic for weeks or months and then

1196
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,199
shipped for some period of time you know

1197
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:54,000
if you were lucky maybe you got some

1198
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:55,500
green Mexican that was only lightly

1199
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,559
compressed that they figured out some

1200
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,599
way to get it across the border without

1201
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:02,818
smushing it into a block that you could

1202
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:04,859
cut with a knife uh yeah you could

1203
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:07,500
actually like break it up into actual

1204
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:09,480
buds instead of it just being like a a

1205
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,059
flat Mass

1206
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,039
um you know and so that's where you know

1207
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:16,858
great Steve Murphy was breeding in the

1208
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:18,779
70s uh Greg and his whole Pacific

1209
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:20,880
Northwest crew

1210
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,460
um the you know most people in

1211
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,400
California were breeding either outdoor

1212
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:28,740
or in greenhouses yes

1213
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,838
uh the indoor wave was still and maybe

1214
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:33,259
this is a good segue

1215
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:36,420
um for a second I printed out this thing

1216
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,740
and uh you can't really see it so I'm

1217
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,599
just gonna read it because it's really

1218
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:43,379
dark this is a this is a Seed Catalog

1219
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,980
um

1220
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:49,800
you know uh from 1981 it's tied into Sam

1221
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:52,858
and his crew we assume

1222
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,318
um but it lists uh strains in order of

1223
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:57,779
of when they matured October November

1224
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:00,119
and December and it lists like what so

1225
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,460
it gives you a snapshot of what people

1226
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,838
were actually working with right yeah

1227
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,880
and uh

1228
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:09,539
so I'll read it to you in October

1229
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:12,660
you had Afghani one Afghani two Afghani

1230
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:15,239
two purple skunk one skunk two

1231
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:17,219
yep that's all they list five things

1232
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,459
before that finished before Halloween

1233
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:22,459
yeah the faster finishing right then you

1234
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:26,699
have November right

1235
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:31,380
Nepali Malawi Nepali Afghani Malawi

1236
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:33,379
Nepali early Haze by Afghani yeah and

1237
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,300
those are done hopefully by Thanksgiving

1238
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:39,539
yep and then here comes the motherload

1239
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,579
of everything and I'll say on this list

1240
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:44,699
it says all of the above can be grown

1241
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:46,920
outside in most years in the SF Bay Area

1242
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:49,679
and that's the October and the November

1243
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:53,280
stuff right and then below it it says

1244
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:56,338
all below require a greenhouse to finish

1245
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,140
in the San Francisco Bay Area yeah and

1246
00:48:56,338 --> 00:49:01,078
now you've got South Indian one two

1247
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:04,858
three original Haze one to four burning

1248
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,280
bush Nepali Hayes Hayes Nepali Nepali

1249
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:10,559
hey South Indian early Haze South Indian

Haze South Indian Thai hey South Indian

1251
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:17,578
South African Haze burning bush by

1252
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,440
Nepali burning bush by South Hayes uh by

1253
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:22,339
South Indian Hayes and then you even

1254
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:28,079
have one category matures in January

1255
00:49:22,338 --> 00:49:30,179
extra late New Year's Haze yeah I bet so

1256
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,720
maybe when people are listening to that

1257
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:35,399
right yeah and uh you're uh you're

1258
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:36,899
realizing that oh my God everything that

1259
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,880
they're mentioning other than afghanian

1260
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,920
skunk I've never had

1261
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,680
yeah I don't have Afghan I don't I don't

1262
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,260
I don't Malawi and Nepali and

1263
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,818
Hayes Thai Nepali and this and that and

1264
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,420
everything else

1265
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,300
um

1266
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,039
there's a bunch of um there's a bunch of

1267
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,318
stuff like that so that gives you like a

1268
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,420
snapshot of like these are what the

1269
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:59,338
Breeders back then were crossing to each

1270
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,818
other yep

1271
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:04,259
right which is super different okay and

1272
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:06,960
so you know

1273
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:08,640
um maybe we can mention this even though

1274
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,619
it kind of like it fits in but it kind

1275
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,480
of doesn't but the reason why we're

1276
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:14,760
talking about all this stuff is that

1277
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,000
basically like every 10 years in my

1278
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,240
opinion cannabis reinvents itself yes

1279
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,179
absolutely and what was common becomes

1280
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:26,039
uncommon or rare yeah and then you go 20

1281
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:29,818
years from that point and what becomes

1282
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:33,599
uncommon or rare becomes like impossible

1283
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:36,000
yeah you know uh Matt and I were

1284
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,338
recently looking at somebody's uh

1285
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,619
freezer collection that they had been

1286
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:42,299
gifted it was a big collection it was

1287
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:44,818
super impressive it was really exciting

1288
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:48,780
to look through and most of it was from

1289
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:50,818
08 to 2012. yeah and I was electing

1290
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,800
heavily during that time and that so

1291
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:54,659
that was Matt's kind of era when he was

1292
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,720
really collecting a ton and stuff and

1293
00:50:54,659 --> 00:51:01,679
and it's amazing that it's it's only 10

1294
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:03,000
to 13 14 years later and 98 of that

1295
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,399
stuff that's on the list you couldn't

1296
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,079
buy today if you wanted to yeah and and

1297
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,519
you'd be lucky to find a reproduction if

1298
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:10,500
you were lucky you'd be lucky to find a

1299
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,300
reproduction you know and there's some

1300
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,159
famous people on there like you know a

1301
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,780
bunch of stuff that people found Fire OG

1302
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,578
Rascal work

1303
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,460
um yeah tons of awesome [ __ ] back then

1304
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:22,318
too and and nowadays like I I even still

1305
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,639
look out for like white Urkel and white

1306
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:25,318
master and a few things when I see them

1307
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:27,118
in lists but they're they're not common

1308
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:29,338
and he was selling tons of those packs

1309
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,800
back then you know he was killing it

1310
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:34,799
still probably is so all this stuff that

1311
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,460
we're talking about right is that you

1312
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,200
know

1313
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:40,199
um what's common in this in the 60s and

1314
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:43,618
70s becomes uncommon in the 80s almost

1315
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:45,960
unheard of in the 90s a unicorn by by

1316
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:49,740
today and that just keeps happening

1317
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,119
right every every 10 or 15 years uh what

1318
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:54,299
you used to be able to get easy access

1319
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,338
to become super hard to find right sure

1320
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,099
but then every generation those 10 or 15

1321
00:51:56,338 --> 00:52:01,440
years they're building on certain things

1322
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,420
like I mentioned that list there's a

1323
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,119
series of afghanis that made it over to

1324
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:08,280
Neville and sssc there's this there's

1325
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:11,160
hazes there's scums there's different

1326
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,920
things that happened in that in that era

1327
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:16,199
that survived sure right but most of the

1328
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,440
stuff on that list you've never smoked

1329
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:21,539
yeah I've never smoked you know I've

1330
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,780
never smoked burning bush by Nepali by

1331
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:27,239
salary bush is I don't I've never seen

1332
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:30,300
it I've heard it was made I've heard

1333
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:32,699
I've heard it was a pre-pre to Haze you

1334
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,160
know it was an early you know but but

1335
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:36,118
you know these names South Indian stuff

1336
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:37,980
like that

1337
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,180
um you know they they just didn't they

1338
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,500
just that but that's what they were

1339
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:43,440
growing

1340
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,059
so all these guys what that shows you is

1341
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,720
that all these guys

1342
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:47,640
um

1343
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:50,159
all these guys were basically breeding

1344
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:52,139
sativas yeah

1345
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,460
right that's the majority of that list

1346
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:57,420
was some sativas there's a couple

1347
00:52:53,460 --> 00:53:00,420
afghanis even skunk one was 75 sativa

1348
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,220
yeah it was a blend of Mexican Colombian

1349
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,500
and a little bit of Afghan

1350
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:06,118
so it was still even heavily influenced

1351
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,719
right

1352
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:11,579
um and so Sam Skunk Man became very

1353
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:13,679
famous in that era that's where you know

1354
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:16,800
he he says he started breeding his skunk

1355
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,659
one in 1975.

1356
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,880
um you know he bred it for eight or ten

1357
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:22,500
years before he brought it to uh

1358
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,099
California or brought it from California

1359
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:28,679
to Amsterdam uh Mel Frank was working

1360
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:30,900
with an afghan that got named Afghani

1361
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:33,598
one that he got from another Bay Area

1362
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,920
breeder uh who had gotten some Afghani

1363
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,780
seeds

1364
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,300
um he got some Durban Poison that he was

1365
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,880
working in the 70s they were breeding

1366
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,859
some other stuff like that Rob Clark was

1367
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,960
obviously busy

1368
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:48,119
um in uh you know Seattle Greg's neck of

1369
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,519
the woods they had somehow come across

1370
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:51,660
some Afghan and they were also blending

1371
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:54,480
in

1372
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:56,159
um some you know all the various sativas

1373
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,260
that people had then

1374
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:00,239
in Hawaii you know people call stuff

1375
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:04,980
Hawaiian but there obviously is no

1376
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:07,078
Hawaiian yeah uh 98 of the species uh on

1377
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,699
Hawaii are not native

1378
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:11,220
um because it's an island in the middle

1379
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:13,558
of nowhere uh that created by a volcano

1380
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:15,179
yeah but people started bringing

1381
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:17,099
Colombian it's very tropical people

1382
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:19,019
started bringing Thai and Colombian and

1383
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,420
Afghans and Mexicans there and blending

1384
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:23,280
them and growing them on the islands and

1385
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,440
then they became known as Hawaiian

1386
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,540
yep you know even though there are

1387
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,059
there's no Hawaiian genetics there's a

1388
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:33,058
blending of sativas

1389
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:35,040
maybe with a touch Afghan right we're

1390

um we'll talk we'll talk a little bit

1426
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,240

00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:58,619
then we'll and then we'll answer some

1428

00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:04,980
this week so we might as well chat at

1431
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:08,099
that so fast forward a bit people are

1432
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:12,179
doing all the stuff in the 70s and

1433
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:13,559
um you know in the uh in the late 70s uh

1434
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:16,259
things were really blowing up people

1435
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:18,000
were doing all kinds of stuff together

1436
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,260
um in very in these various regions I

1437
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,199
was talking about it was really

1438
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,940
advancing uh then Carter loses the

1439
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:26,399
election

1440
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:29,338
Reagan gets uh Reagan gets involved and

1441
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,858
the War on Drugs gets ramped up and the

1442
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:33,599
world goes to [ __ ] for from the from

1443
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:35,519
where it had been the penalties are yeah

1444
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,240
they start putting more money into it

1445
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:41,219
and uh they start flying

1446
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:43,558
they start taking helicopters and they

1447
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:46,019
start flying in Hawaii they start flying

1448
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:48,000
in Mendocino County they start flying in

1449
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:51,480
the Central Valley and some of this

1450
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,679
stuff rep and so what that does is that

1451
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,240
all of a sudden all these guys are

1452
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:55,799
growing all this weed and they're

1453
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:57,239
growing it in the mountain regions and

1454
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,519
they're growing it in valleys and stuff

1455
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:01,558
like that and they're not too concerned

1456
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,119
because nobody's looking for them and

1457
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:05,640
then also there's a helicopter flying

1458
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,680
overhead sure and they got a big field

1459
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:10,679
that nobody's ever bothered with before

1460
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:13,019
and they get in trouble right so

1461
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:16,440
pressure starts happening right

1462
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:18,780
so you know they start hunting it uh

1463
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,420
people start getting in trouble and then

1464
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:23,160
this is when so we mentioned before

1465
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,079
Steve Murphy's book

1466
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:27,000
um and stuff like that but

1467
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:29,640
people were on the What's called the

1468
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,559
hippie hashish Trail where people were

1469
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:33,118
traveling to Nepal people were traveling

1470
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:35,220
to India people were traveling to the

1471
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,380
Hindu Kush mountains they were meeting

1472
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:39,598
up with tribal you know people and stuff

1473
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:42,720
like that and so there was some small

1474
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,119
amount of Afghan seeds and indicas that

1475
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:47,879
started making its way into America yeah

1476
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,980
mostly only to breeder circles certainly

1477
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,720
not to Consumers the way every bag was

1478
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:53,818
every sack of weed you bought had a

1479
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,818
bunch of seeds in it for free but they

1480
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:59,460
started trickling in smuggling style to

1481
00:57:56,818 --> 00:58:02,639
Trinity Humboldt Mendocino to the Bay

1482
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:04,679
Area to various other places

1483
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,759
um you know in in Steve Murphy's book

1484
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:11,699
you see some broadleaf Afghans in 74. uh

1485
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,640
obviously uh you know uh you know

1486
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:16,139
Seattle Greg was working with some of

1487
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,299
this stuff

1488
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:20,400
um and so the the big advantage in the

1489
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,079
beginning to people was that you start

1490
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,818
Crossing these Afghans into some of

1491
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,559
these sativas and now maybe you're

1492
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:28,139
getting stuff that's finishing you know

1493
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:30,599
the more heavy Afghan you select you're

1494
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:33,118
finishing in September or October

1495
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:34,318
sure and and one second I just want to

1496
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,119
make sure everybody's really paying

1497
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:37,920
close attention to this part because I

1498
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:40,680
found one of the biggest uh myths in

1499
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,380
cannabis is that afghanis existed in our

1500
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:44,699
culture you know just as long as sativas

1501
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,338
and as long as we've been smoking broad

1502
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:49,500
or uh narrow Leafs you know people

1503
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:51,179
didn't know that afghanis came as a late

1504
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,579
entry so when you see a lot of these

1505
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:56,098
people making claims about 60s afghanis

1506
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:57,780
and 50s afghanis it's very easy to

1507
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:02,579
Discount with history

1508
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:04,500
so while seed of sativas like we said

1509
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:06,960
before were getting imported by the

1510
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:10,500
literal ton with every bag of weed you

1511
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,358
bought you got seeds of seeds and the

1512
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,039
the Indica stuff was being brought back

1513
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:17,039
by Smugglers and what I would imagine

1514
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:19,739
would be relatively small amounts uh you

1515
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,420
know in his interview uh you know Greg

1516
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:24,598
told you that he got a whopping four

1517
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:26,280
Afghan seeds yeah whopping a whopping

1518
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:28,200
four you know

1519
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,880
um and the biggest problem that you know

1520
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:31,858
you grow in Afghanistan and you and you

1521
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,180
grow in the Hindu Kush mountains it's

1522
00:59:31,858 --> 00:59:35,639
obviously colder there and it's

1523
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:36,838
extremely dry so people start growing

1524
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:40,920
them in America

1525
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:43,259
and they rot yeah the sativas were grown

1526
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,298
in tropical much more humid regions they

1527
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:47,579
had a lot of genetic resistance to rot

1528
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:49,739
and so a lot of the things that people

1529
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:51,298
were trying to figure out is they can

1530
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:53,519
grow these Afghans and they're like oh

1531
00:59:51,298 --> 00:59:55,858
my God it's an amazing beautiful Frosty

1532
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:57,719
crazy looking weed yeah and it's not

1533
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:59,940
done and you get some weather and all of

1534
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,379
a sudden it rots on and it has a totally

1535
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,358
different High than a lot of people are

1536
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:05,818
used to yeah people go from an up

1537
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:09,480
energetic kind of Zippy High somewhat

1538
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:11,940
psychedelic wow this that indicas come

1539
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,880
with much more couch lock much more

1540
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:18,119
heaviness much more limitations so a lot

1541
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:20,940
of the early smokers didn't like indica

1542
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:24,240
yeah it clashed so hard with what they

1543
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:26,818
were used to as Buds and and the effect

1544
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:28,798
they weren't super into it but from a

1545
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:31,920
Grower's perspective since I read all

1546
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:34,739
that stuff you know going from November

1547
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,240
December Harvest to September October

1548
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:39,479
Harvest when you have police pressure

1549
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:41,159
becomes extremely important yeah

1550
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,760
right

1551
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:44,940
um

1552
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,799
and so you know I maybe we should talk

1553
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,480
very briefly

1554
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:51,539
um because it's a pretty simple subject

1555
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,699
but when I moved to Mendo in the late

1556
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:54,719
90s people still mostly Grew From seed

1557
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:56,519
outside

1558
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,858
and the traditional way that you grew

1559
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:01,619
from seed was that you would grow some

1560
01:00:58,858 --> 01:01:03,960
seed you would pick your males you would

1561
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:06,119
take your males to like a kind of a

1562
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,639
darker part of your Hill somewhere and

1563
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:11,160
you would stash them away from your

1564
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:13,739
females you would grow your females in

1565
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:16,318
some patches right and then you'd

1566
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:18,838
collect pollen and you'd go take this

1567
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:20,940
pollen from all your males and you'd

1568
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:23,639
brush it on some of the lower branches

1569
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:26,760
of your favorite females from that year

1570
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:28,618
yeah and I believe that's how the vast

1571
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,900
majority of breeding occurred even when

1572
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:33,420
you look at like Rob Clark's book he

1573
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,539
talks about like putting like a paper

1574
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:39,059
bag paper bags the paper bag with a with

1575
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:41,279
a tie over specific branches and putting

1576
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:43,079
one up on the bag you know even talks

1577
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,359
about like gluing a strip of clear

1578
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:47,940
plastic so that it gets some sun on it

1579
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:50,759
while it's doing this yeah

1580
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:54,298
all that type of stuff and so most most

1581
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,040
70s breeding in America was pollinating

1582
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:57,179
the bottoms of stuff you were intending

1583
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:58,259
on selling

1584
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:00,239
yeah

1585
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:03,240
and then keeping it

1586
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,798
yeah right and then you know with the

1587
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:06,899
police pressure and stuff like that

1588
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:11,519
that's really where modern modern

1589
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:15,298
breeding starts yeah okay so

1590
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:18,000
um 70s breeding not exclusively but

1591
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:20,460
essentially was the vast majority was

1592
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,039
seasonally they would pollinate their

1593
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:26,220
best females with males they had kept

1594
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,960
somewhere else yeah right with the

1595
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:31,318
Advent of indoor lights and the Advent

1596
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,818
of hydroponic stores and people like uh

1597
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:35,460
and growing in the Pacific Northwest

1598
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:37,440
like we've talked about multiple times

1599
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:40,260
people started to do some of this

1600
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,900
breeding inside yeah they started doing

1601
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:46,740
it away from the helicopters

1602
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:49,858
away from away from the lights away from

1603
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:51,358
the ability to get caught and it also it

1604
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:53,759
also enabled

1605
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,480
um people to do more than one breeding a

1606
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,500
year

1607
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,318
yeah yeah I mean back

1608
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:04,559
in the day you got like you got one shot

1609
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:06,539
right yeah that's that's what you got

1610
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,280
you all of a sudden you go indoor and

1611
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:10,139
now as you know you can get four or five

1612
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,079
shots if you want

1613
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:16,199
yeah you know right and so that's when

1614
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:19,680
that's when you know prohibition really

1615
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:24,598
forced people to start going inside

1616
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:28,679
and going inside is obviously how 99 of

1617
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:30,539
modern breeding occurs yeah I would say

1618
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:32,940
you know there's not I mean there are

1619
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:36,480
some people that still breed Outdoor and

1620
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,338
I would say most people breed Outdoor in

1621
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,679
modern times because it's much more

1622
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:42,058
cheap to make seeds that way I think the

1623
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:43,739
ones that take it very seriously and are

1624
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:45,780
doing actual selections do it indoors

1625
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:48,298
but generally speaking let's do it

1626
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,460
outdoor you know maybe I should rephrase

1627
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:52,619
it most of the seeds that you guys have

1628
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:55,079
access to that you can buy currently

1629
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:57,838
were probably made indoor

1630
01:03:55,079 --> 01:04:00,240
no you know you don't think so no not at

1631
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:04,259
all no not at all it's all done outdoor

1632
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:05,338
in Greenhouse yeah 99 of it 99 of it

1633
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,740
yeah

1634
01:04:05,338 --> 01:04:08,818
yeah even today even today most of the

1635
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:12,659
seeds that people buy are going to be

1636
01:04:08,818 --> 01:04:15,659
coming from places big seed banks from

1637
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:17,219
the UK maybe stuff like that so I the

1638
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:20,639
way I was looking at it is most of this

1639
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:22,618
most of the small and and Motors most of

1640
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:24,659
the pipe breeders that people are

1641
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:27,240
actually buying a bunch of packs of

1642
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:28,858
these days they're you know

1643
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,618
um they're mostly doing they were mostly

1644
01:04:28,858 --> 01:04:32,699
doing it in indoor scenes

1645
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:34,260
um some of them were doing it in

1646
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:35,939
greenhouses

1647
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:38,099
um certainly he's correct in the sense

1648
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,659
that like if I'm only talking about what

1649
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:41,700
most people have access to obviously

1650
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:44,159
when it comes to like all the Mexican

1651
01:04:41,699 --> 01:04:45,539
and all the traditional stuff and some

1652
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:48,480
of the stuff that's going on in Europe

1653
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:50,099
at a larger scale uh where legality is

1654
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,318
different like Switzerland or Spain

1655
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:56,838
they're still probably using greenhouses

1656
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:56,838
that's like 95 of the market though

1657
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:03,298
American American Boutique breeding is

1658
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:05,279
still small Market

1659
01:05:03,298 --> 01:05:06,960
um and even then a lot of these guys are

1660
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,640
doing it Outdoors making the seeds

1661
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,039
outdoors and I don't know places like

1662
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:12,659
Compton is crazy crazy places that you

1663
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,980
can never imagine you can never imagine

1664
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:18,358
so small small greenhouses tucked away

1665
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:22,019
who make the most amount of seeds and

1666
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:23,539
and that's I think for during the uh

1667
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:26,099
oh

1668
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:29,338
early to late

1669
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:31,140
up to 2008 2009 a lot of the boutique

1670
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:34,500
breeders were all doing it indoors in

1671
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:36,779
indoors yes but so basically Galaxy that

1672
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,298
was a poorly phrased way to say sure

1673
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:41,519
that from the 80s 90s and the first 10

1674
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:44,159
years of the 2000s for about a 30-year

1675
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:46,798
period yeah prohibition had a lot of

1676
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,719
breeding happening indoors exactly a lot

1677
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:52,079
of your famous strains that you know of

1678
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:55,019
uh whether they were from sssc or from

1679
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:58,318
Neville or from smaller breeders in

1680
01:05:55,019 --> 01:06:00,358
America all the northern lights work all

1681
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:03,179
that type of stuff the prohibition was

1682
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:05,759
Heavy uh the legality was still not

1683
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:07,318
spread out very much and so for three

1684
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,079
decades

1685
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:13,440
um the vast majority of of breeding that

1686
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:16,500
we're aware of uh did did happen inside

1687
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,539
yeah and now it's opened up again uh you

1688
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,099
know in various ways in the last you

1689
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:22,079
know 10 or 15 years and it's beginning

1690
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:23,700
to shift yeah it took legalities

1691
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,318
changing in the US though really I think

1692
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:26,939
that's what changed it when people were

1693
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:29,099
able to grow outdoor or and not get

1694
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,599
popped for it they realize that the

1695
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:33,838
amount of seeds you can make outdoor

1696
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:35,519
versus indoors is Monumental but pollen

1697
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:37,440
control is totally a different subject

1698
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,599
control is hard

1699
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,579
um not and no and pollen viability is

1700
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,920
hard too I mean I know people that have

1701
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:46,980
tried to throw off huge Greenhouse runs

1702
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:49,440
and their Greenhouse is too moist and

1703
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,599
pollen doesn't like heat light or water

1704
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,579
and I've seen a bunch of people have a

1705
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,160
bunch of failure uh because they weren't

1706
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:57,900
able to control their humidity uh in

1707
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,298
their greenhouse and they think oh I'm

1708
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:03,900
gonna make 15 million seeds sure and

1709
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:05,880
they make 80 000. yeah which is still a

1710
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,380
lot but it's a far cry from 15 million

1711
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,838
because they lost control of their

1712
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,480
humidity so

1713
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,940
um you know part of the so this is kind

1714
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,460
of taking us up to like

1715
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,500
people are getting busted I think bad

1716
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:22,380
things are happening and a lot of these

1717
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:24,239
American breeders okay and this is what

1718
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,400
segues into what we've done the last few

1719
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:27,959
shows a bunch of these American breeders

1720
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,298
start fleeing

1721
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:33,358
where it's hot and uncomfortable which

1722
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:36,298
is Reagan America to where it's more

1723
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:39,719
comfortable which is Europe Holland

1724
01:07:36,298 --> 01:07:42,900
right Rob yeah ends up in going into

1725
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:44,578
Holland's Sam uh Jim all these guys are

1726
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:47,760
bringing that's why Neville and all

1727
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:49,619
these groups got access to it uh was not

1728
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,599
because that all these guys wanted to

1729
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:53,220
share it was because they were seeking a

1730
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,119
new place to continue doing what they

1731
01:07:53,219 --> 01:07:56,639
were doing

1732
01:07:54,119 --> 01:08:00,000
yeah it got real plot it got real

1733
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:02,578
problematic in the early in the early to

1734
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,039
mid 80s late 80s

1735
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:06,780
um I mean you know uh to bring up

1736
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,579
Seattle Greg again he you know he

1737
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:11,099
mentioned on on when you interviewed him

1738
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:12,780
that by the late 80s a rolling series of

1739
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:15,298
busts had pretty much taken out his

1740
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:18,119
whole crew yep all the work that they

1741
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:19,798
had done had been lost yeah to them you

1742
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:21,119
know luckily he shared it with people in

1743
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:24,420
Holland

1744
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:27,659
um you know uh Sam skunkman and Rob and

1745
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,940
Mel and Ed and uh these different names

1746
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:31,500
that shared things with groups they did

1747
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:34,198
so because it was getting uncomfortably

1748
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,838
hot to do it where they lived

1749
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:38,219
right yeah and they were trying to they

1750
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:40,979
were trying to figure out where to do it

1751
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:42,600
and so that kind of segues us into

1752
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:45,000
what we what we talked about which is

1753
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,560
kind of where we were at of this is how

1754
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,039
breeding got

1755
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:53,279
and then with sssc and with Neville and

1756
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:55,500
with other groups and that whole era not

1757
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,900
only because Holland has you know

1758
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,298
um not the greatest weather uh but also

1759
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:02,278
for clandestine reasons and simplicity

1760
01:09:00,298 --> 01:09:04,738
and everything like that most of the

1761
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:08,160
breeding in the 80s and 90s uh at least

1762
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:11,579
by the mid 80s uh through the 90s uh was

1763
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:13,738
indoor yes you know the famous strains

1764
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:16,679
uh you know Sour Diesel was made inside

1765
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:18,959
a lot of the famous Pops that happened

1766
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:21,298
uh that came about 90s weed was coming

1767
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,219
from indoor right that was where people

1768
01:09:21,298 --> 01:09:24,838
could get away with it

1769
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:27,359
um people were able to grow in the 60s

1770
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:28,798
and 70s for a while freely and then the

1771
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,600
cops found out what they were doing and

1772
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:31,979
they started looking for it and it

1773
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,120
became much more difficult to get away

1774
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:36,298
with it

1775
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:37,679
and uh and so then people responded to

1776
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:40,679
that police pressure

1777
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:42,779
by hiding it yep

1778
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:45,359
and then we went from sort of like

1779
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:48,600
yearly breeding outside and in

1780
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,039
greenhouses to much more cracks at the

1781
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,140
same thing you could breed you could set

1782
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:54,479
up different rooms it's probably very

1783
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,340
unlikely that somebody like Neville or

1784
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:57,779
somebody like the super sativa seed Club

1785
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,460
group would have been able to offer as

1786
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:02,039
many strains as they did

1787
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:04,380
oh yeah without your individual rooms

1788
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:06,179
yeah uh the amount you know Matt and I

1789
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,640
were joking about the amount of pollen

1790
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:10,800
contamination that could have been

1791
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,940
possible back then yeah you know but

1792
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,500
certainly if you were trying to do it

1793
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:16,619
outside in the greenhouse you're limited

1794
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:18,779
to one you know one set of pollen

1795
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:20,340
yeah otherwise it's just gonna be you're

1796
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:21,658
just going to have pollen grains flying

1797
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:23,159
around and who the hell knows what is

1798
01:10:21,658 --> 01:10:24,899
happening playing who's your daddy with

1799
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:27,179
seeds like a lot of these guys do now

1800
01:10:24,899 --> 01:10:31,198
yeah right you know so indoor gardening

1801
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:33,179
also allowed people to uh you know

1802
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,859
it allowed people to do multiple

1803
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:38,579
different lines you could offer skunk

1804
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:41,099
one and Durbin and nl5 Haze and nl5

1805
01:10:38,579 --> 01:10:42,719
skunk one and you could have

1806
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,940
you know I don't exactly know the size

1807
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,140
of these people's rooms but that's

1808
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:48,839
probably not that much different than it

1809
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:51,960
was today some bedrooms yeah closets

1810
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:56,039
some garages you know some converted

1811
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,840
spaces yeah and that's kind of like that

1812
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:59,119
kind of like brings us from like where

1813
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,920
we were

1814
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:04,920
importing you know uh indigenous

1815
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,260
people's weed to like how people first

1816
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,000
bred in the 70s to how it changed and

1817
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:11,760
police pressure kind of led us to like

1818
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,439
where we're at today yep um you know

1819
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,020
that's kind of that's that's kind of the

1820
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:17,759
arc and that kind of leads us right into

1821
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:19,679
what we talked about at length the last

1822
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,880
two episodes of how Neville was doing

1823
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,579
all his work

1824
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,980
yeah um they were uh

1825
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:28,619
you know they moved it inside

1826
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:30,599
you know so I don't know maybe we can

1827
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:32,819
pause since we're how long in now an

1828
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,640
hour and ten minutes hour and 20. yeah

1829
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:37,079
maybe we can pause and we can start I

1830
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,880
don't know can you see questions because

1831
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:41,819
yeah I can see questions this time yeah

1832
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:45,000
so maybe we should uh maybe we should

1833
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:46,920
start an order on the votes aspect yep

1834
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,319
uh all right

1835
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,658
there I go uh what are each of your guys

1836
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:53,219
daily driver strains right now and what

1837
01:11:51,658 --> 01:11:56,219
do you like about the strains to use

1838
01:11:53,219 --> 01:11:58,140
them every day go ahead

1839
01:11:56,219 --> 01:12:00,119
uh what's your what's your normal daily

1840
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,860
driver like uh not necessarily today but

1841
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:04,679
your normal one that you you would grab

1842
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:06,179
if you had it every time so I like you

1843
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:09,359
know I think it's pretty obvious to

1844
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:11,279
people I like uh sour diesels and chems

1845
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,079
and headbands

1846
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,779
um you know I like strains that have a

1847
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:17,519
potent and unique High uh and I also

1848
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:19,738
like strains that I can smoke every day

1849
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,239
and they get me high yeah there's a lot

1850
01:12:19,738 --> 01:12:23,279
of strains out there that get you pretty

1851
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:25,559
high the first number of days you smoke

1852
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:27,300
them and then you kind of plateau on

1853
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,239
them and they don't take you to where

1854
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:32,159
you need to be yeah on a daily basis so

1855
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,079
I like strains that have lasting power

1856
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:35,460
and the ability to like get me high the

1857
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:39,238
way I like every day

1858
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:41,399
uh and there is no I mean the chem 91

1859
01:12:39,238 --> 01:12:43,859
makes me feel like I'm a stone teenager

1860
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:46,920
about to watch a comedy eating popcorn

1861
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:50,819
and making it's a warm fuzzy comforting

1862
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:53,399
buzz you know uh nl5 hazes can make me

1863
01:12:50,819 --> 01:12:55,319
feel up energetic maybe a little

1864
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:57,119
paranoid

1865
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:58,619
um you know different types of things to

1866
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,019
be honest there are certain things that

1867
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:02,119
are quite famous that I find have a

1868
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,560
boring High

1869
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:07,460
you know so

1870
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:10,520
um chems headbands sour diesels

1871
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:12,719
uh you know sativas that type of thing

1872
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:15,239
uh you know it depends on my mood

1873
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,279
obviously I don't want to smoke uh you

1874
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:19,319
know a high-end sativa like dog [ __ ]

1875
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:21,479
like at 11 30 at night right before bed

1876
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:23,039
because I might like set my mind off

1877
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:26,579
till 1am

1878
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:29,460
but uh yeah chems headbands diesels

1879
01:13:26,579 --> 01:13:31,979
that's what I like what do you like Matt

1880
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:34,319
um I'm pretty uh obvious with mine like

1881
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:37,919
I'm a blueberry thing and I like them

1882
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:41,039
different ties they seemed afghanis were

1883
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:43,440
where most afghanis generally speaking

1884
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:45,840
broadly if afghanis tend to relax people

1885
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,879
and and you know ease them in that [ __ ]

1886
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,380
me up that [ __ ] makes me stay in my head

1887
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,600
it's like living in your [ __ ] head

1888
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:53,039
and hating life so I tend to like the

1889
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,480
ties that are really light I like

1890
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:56,579
lighter high so if I have to punch

1891
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:58,619
someone I can still I don't like to be

1892
01:13:56,579 --> 01:14:01,380
disabled you know but yeah that's

1893
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:04,198
typically what I like and one point that

1894
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:05,520
we should make is that uh you know we

1895
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:07,379
have some really good friends where some

1896
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,000
of my favorite strains they dislike they

1897
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,679
don't dislike them they breed with them

1898
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,140
but they don't like their High very much

1899
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:16,020
and so there is you know everybody

1900
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:18,539
thinks what happens to me is normal

1901
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:20,040
um but with weed it's not normal uh

1902
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:21,119
people can have different effects I know

1903
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,939
people you know there might be people

1904
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:26,460
that have a little add that they smoke a

1905
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:29,339
a racy sativa and they feel calm and

1906
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:30,899
relaxed and melt yeah where they smoke

1907
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:32,460
an Afghan and it makes them want to jump

1908
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:34,738
out of their skin and climb up a wall

1909
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:36,000
yeah where an Afghan for me makes me

1910
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:38,519
want to like lean back and eat some

1911
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,319
popcorn and mellow out and laugh yeah an

1912
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,060
Afghan makes me want it like would make

1913
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:45,479
me like think about chopping down my

1914
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:47,640
grow you know like paranoia yeah so so

1915
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:50,218
it's kind of it is very individual

1916
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:52,140
it's it doesn't affect people the same

1917
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:54,840
the next question is what in your

1918
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:57,360
opinion was the most prominent strain to

1919
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:01,860
come out of Holland in the 90s other

1920
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:04,519
than chem NL Haze and skunk

1921
01:15:01,859 --> 01:15:04,519
boy

1922
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:11,579
boy

1923
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:13,139
well I mean that was a big one for me

1924
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:14,698
one of my one that I was really

1925
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:18,000
interested in was purple star and that

1926
01:15:14,698 --> 01:15:20,178
was a uh a Dutch purple Afghani of some

1927
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,179
sort

1928
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:23,279
um you know this is kind of cheating

1929
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:26,880
because I kind of think it's like modern

1930
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:29,579
skunk but certainly in the 90s uh you

1931
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:32,039
know Sour Diesel in America

1932
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:34,019
um became you know it's it's a it's

1933
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:35,880
possibly a blend of Kevin skunk so maybe

1934
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:37,260
that's not the same but it is it is

1935
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,119
different it's not either one of those

1936
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:40,860
things that's its own thing and it

1937
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:44,340
became one of the most popular strains

1938
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:46,319
in America during that time frame

1939
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:48,659
um you know it's hard because when you

1940
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,460
say NL Haze and skunk

1941
01:15:48,658 --> 01:15:51,960
there's a lot of things that have at

1942
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:54,840
least one of those components in them

1943
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,279
yeah you know very hard not to name one

1944
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:59,819
yeah it's very hard not to name

1945
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:01,198
something that doesn't happen yeah uh

1946
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:02,880
you know but but if you're gonna name

1947
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:06,599
some of that stuff you could probably

1948
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:08,159
throw in uh the white family that came

1949
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,800
out of Holland you know I mean in the

1950
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:14,099
mid 90s the White Widow the great white

1951
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:16,980
shark the White Russian uh that whole

1952
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:18,900
line it doesn't have any NL hazer skunk

1953
01:16:16,979 --> 01:16:19,439
that we're aware of

1954
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:21,119
um

1955
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:23,279
you know it was completely it was

1956
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,260
different genetics uh it was extremely

1957
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:27,179
popular it was all over High Times it

1958
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:29,760
was winning cups yeah it was getting

1959
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:31,140
blended into all kinds of stuff

1960
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,539
um when I first started growing White

1961
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,560
Widow and white rhino were the ones you

1962
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:35,939
know like that's what people were

1963
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,280
talking about yeah

1964
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:41,519
um you know another thing is uh this

1965
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:45,000
this kind of I think this angers DJ but

1966
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:47,699
um you know DJ gave uh DJ gave Tony from

1967
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,460
sag Martha a bunch of blueberry lines

1968
01:16:47,698 --> 01:16:52,859
and sag Martha started selling blueberry

1969
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:55,020
and probably for most people that was

1970
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:57,960
their first ability to actually purchase

1971
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:59,520
those lines yeah um he didn't you know

1972
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,560
if he was giving it to friends or people

1973
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,620
in his small Network it certainly wasn't

1974
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:07,199
as prevalent as giving it to Sag Martha

1975
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:09,359
yeah later uh later later on in the 90s

1976
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:12,658
after he had soured on sag Martha I

1977
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:15,000
believe Dutch Passion uh took over some

1978
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:18,119
of his blueberry work and stuff like

1979
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,279
that and so whether or not he is

1980
01:17:18,119 --> 01:17:23,099
appreciative of that or not certainly

1981
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:27,000
sag Martha and Dutch Passion and their

1982
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:29,400
breadth of sales put blueberry and those

1983
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,198
lines on the map they did gave people

1984
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:33,479
access to them it gave people the

1985
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:35,399
ability to buy them you know it made

1986
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:37,979
them it made him essentially Forum

1987
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:39,420
famous when cannabis world and overgrow

1988
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:42,000
were happening because all of a sudden

1989
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:43,500
you could get these like these cool

1990
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,840
sounding strains with these pretty

1991
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,640
colors all that kind of stuff was going

1992
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,619
on so

1993
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:52,199
um those were those were pretty famous

1994
01:17:49,619 --> 01:17:54,779
you'd have to say they certainly caught

1995
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:58,139
Americans attention

1996
01:17:54,779 --> 01:18:00,539
um and they're also not NL chem Haze or

1997
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:03,199
skunk yep but for the most part most

1998
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:03,198
famous things

1999
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,100
you know he's the building these are the

2000
01:18:06,539 --> 01:18:11,460
building block strains so it's hard to

2001
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:14,699
get away from them this one is all matte

2002
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:16,319
okay with me what was Hobbes breath

2003
01:18:14,698 --> 01:18:18,899
creating or was Hog's Breath created

2004
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:21,840
using SSC genetics yes uh the only thing

2005
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:24,238
I know for sure pretty sure is uh that

2006
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,920
Jimbo used uh Williams Wonder now

2007
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:28,619
whether it was Williams Wonder crosstalk

2008
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,779
random NL Williams Wonder cross two and

2009
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:32,099
Afghani Williams Wonder it hard to say

2010
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:34,198
hard to say

2011
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,880
um his story did change based on who we

2012
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:37,799
told but that was intentional he did not

2013
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,420
want people recreating it

2014
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,699
um that that cut was kept very tight

2015
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,440
until uh several years after his passing

2016
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:45,658
and it is now

2017
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:47,579
out there

2018
01:18:45,658 --> 01:18:49,259
um his sister has the Hog's Breath

2019
01:18:47,579 --> 01:18:51,359
company and her husband they're doing an

2020
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:53,460
awesome job with it uh awesome awesome

2021
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:55,259
clothes I'm still getting all my Hogs

2022
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:57,359
gear and Jim Jim was a major influence

2023
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:59,039
on me for those that don't know

2024
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:00,899
um so yeah Hogs one of my favorite

2025
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:03,179
all-time strains I believe crd

2026
01:19:00,899 --> 01:19:04,619
underscore SD is going to be doing some

2027
01:19:03,179 --> 01:19:08,039
stuff with the Hogs breath family to

2028
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:10,140
bring it back again all right uh can you

2029
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:12,719
guys talk about the 88g13 hash plant

2030
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:14,520
that Indian worked with not bread please

2031
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,739
Bodhi uses it as a male and I believe

2032
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,060
Haze man or someone else even though

2033
01:19:16,738 --> 01:19:21,059
they weren't supposed to be released

2034
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:23,940
pure yeah um the the G13 hash plant was

2035
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:26,520
selected uh from supposedly bought 1988

2036
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:28,919
via Sensi which was not the case

2037
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:31,440
um and

2038
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:32,899
and that was by swampy who was an old

2039
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:35,279
overgrown member Indian was his friend

2040
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:36,899
uh Indian gets his name attached a lot

2041
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:38,639
of stuff but what ends up happening is

2042
01:19:36,899 --> 01:19:40,198
he asks other breeders to send in

2043
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,820
precedes he distributes them without the

2044
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:43,559
breeder's name and it get his name about

2045
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:44,819
stuck with it again like the ADHD 13

2046
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,920
hashplan

2047
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:50,460
um but it is it is the G13 hash plant

2048
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:52,640
aka Mr Nice that seed bank or was this

2049
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:55,079
seed bank distributed

2050
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:59,460
there's a couple things with this yeah

2051
01:19:55,079 --> 01:20:02,698
I'll throw in uh one is that there is no

2052
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:05,100
88 G13 hash plant in the seed bank it

2053
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:07,439
comes out in 89. yeah

2054
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:09,600
um so you know what's a year uh anyway

2055
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,178
but and

2056
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:15,300
um from my understanding uh it had been

2057
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:19,199
sort of bred to F4 before Bodhi got it

2058
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:20,880
and Bodhi cracked him and did some he

2059
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,819
didn't realize it had been bred to F4

2060
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:26,279
and bottlenecked a bit so he got it and

2061
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:28,079
he bred it and he bred it a few times

2062
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:29,399
and he realized that all the breeding

2063
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:33,600
work that he had done with it was kind

2064
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:35,460
of bunk and his best work with it which

2065
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,860
is what he crossed everything to and

2066
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,480
everybody has access to was actually the

2067
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:42,000
initial seed pop

2068
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:43,559
you did better with the initial batch of

2069
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,020
seeds that he got because they'd already

2070
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,820
been heavily selected for than him

2071
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:50,640
trying to work within the narrow pool

2072
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:52,979
post that he thought he was going F you

2073
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:55,920
know F1 to F3 maybe yeah and he was

2074
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:57,779
really going like F5 to f8 yeah and

2075
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,279
that's a big difference right that is

2076
01:20:57,779 --> 01:21:01,139
amazing so I think most of what you're

2077
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:02,698
getting when you get stuff from Bodhi is

2078
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,880
the initial batch of seeds that he had

2079
01:21:02,698 --> 01:21:07,738
got that had already been narrowed down

2080
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:10,380
and I don't know when they came from

2081
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:13,379
they didn't come from 1988

2082
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:15,719
um they were sold in 89 and in 90. they

2083
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:19,380
were not sold by Scentsy

2084
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:21,119
um and I don't think until uh Mr Nice I

2085
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:22,859
believe until they named it Mr Nice and

2086
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:24,920
Matt and I discovered that that didn't

2087
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:28,679
pop up in a Scentsy catalog until almost

2088
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:30,960
1999. yeah it was a long time so it was

2089
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:33,840
available for two years from Neville's

2090
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,539
seed bank in 89 and 90. I believe that's

2091
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,699
probably where they come from uh it was

2092
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:41,579
probably a pack or two that the guy bred

2093
01:21:38,698 --> 01:21:44,339
with yeah know honestly and so that's

2094
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:46,679
not that big of a selection pool uh and

2095
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:48,060
that's the it's obviously you know I

2096
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:51,300
mean bodies had some great success

2097
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,620
breeding with some of that uh it's also

2098
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,960
probably one of those ones where there's

2099
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:58,198
not a bunch of places to go with it

2100
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,640
yep it kind of is what it is the breed's

2101
01:21:58,198 --> 01:22:01,198
very dominant

2102
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:03,119
um it's pretty purple

2103
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,219
smaller butted uh some are some are

2104
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:07,198
large yielding but I I believe the one

2105
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:09,179
that the male that buddy uses imparts

2106
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:11,579
purple traits the deadly Gmail I think

2107
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:13,859
he calls it and also uh for those that

2108
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:16,559
don't know swampy who originally put out

2109
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:18,658
those G13 hash plant seeds he also did a

2110
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,360
cross called free Leonard and that was

2111
01:22:18,658 --> 01:22:22,439
the G13 hash plant butterscotch wine I

2112
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:23,099
believe the butterscotch wine was a

2113
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:24,599
female

2114
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:28,140
yeah

2115
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:30,360
um and that was phenomenal phenomenal

2116
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:33,360
um who was it was it Oren that worked

2117
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:34,799
with it I think uh yeah Oren worked with

2118
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:36,059
it for a little bit and has done some

2119
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,279
cool [ __ ] with it

2120
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:39,780
um it made his caramel line and a lot of

2121
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:43,319
people have since used the caramel line

2122
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:45,238
and and you know yeah that's about all I

2123
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:46,738
can do that one the next question will

2124
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:48,238
go over very quickly because I think

2125
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:50,218
Matt and I will both kind of want to

2126
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:52,139
punt on it but we'll see

2127
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:53,760
did Barney's Farm ever have their own

2128
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:56,100
in-house breeders have they always been

2129
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,900
a bulk seed reseller uh I don't think

2130
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,219
matter I had a super high opinion of

2131
01:22:57,899 --> 01:23:00,799
Barney's

2132
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:04,020
um I think they've always kind of been a

2133
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,719
serious seller I think they came in very

2134
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:08,580
late to the game when the Dutch scene

2135
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:11,219
had already been significantly reduced

2136
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:13,319
from its golden and even silver era they

2137
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:16,500
kind of came in at the at the tail end

2138
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:18,779
of all that uh I don't know anybody that

2139
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:20,039
has actually bred for them doesn't mean

2140
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:22,019
that they didn't have a little bit of

2141
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:24,300
their own house stuff doesn't mean you

2142
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:26,100
couldn't have found good stuff uh but

2143
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:28,500
certainly most of the Dutch seed banks

2144
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,300
in the last 10 years have have certainly

2145
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,460
fallen off from what they were previous

2146
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,779
to that in terms of what people find

2147
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:39,420
from them so uh next question

2148
01:23:35,779 --> 01:23:42,238
longitivity on seeds and pollen uh one

2149
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:45,060
is quite easy if you put seeds in the

2150
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:48,059
fridge and or the freezer

2151
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:49,620
um you can extend their life ex you know

2152
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:51,719
by quite a bit and that's pretty

2153
01:23:49,619 --> 01:23:54,719
standard just about every breeder I know

2154
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:57,239
that wants the longevity on his seeds

2155
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,800
um they uh

2156
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:00,178
you know they put them in the freezer or

2157
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,179
the fridge

2158
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:06,179
right yeah I'm just trying to read the

2159
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:08,640
other questions the pollen the pollen um

2160
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:10,560
Matt can speak to this I'm sure pollen

2161
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,280
is a lot more delicate than seeds it has

2162
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:16,679
a lot more limited shelf life

2163
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:18,960
and Rob Spurs book they talk about you

2164
01:24:16,679 --> 01:24:21,179
know baking some flour in the in the

2165
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,880
oven you know and then mixing that flour

2166
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:25,920
either 10 or 100 to one and then

2167
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,520
freezing that

2168
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:32,640
um you know uh pollen is a lot iffier

2169
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:34,679
heat light water all kills it

2170
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:39,539
um it's a lot less viable than a hard

2171
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:41,219
seed to keep alive so uh you know

2172
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:43,019
um that's all I'll say about that any

2173
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:45,239
any way you want to store pollen that's

2174
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:48,060
not fresh there's various ways to go

2175
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:50,479
about it if they're all iffy people have

2176
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:53,699
some greater success than others

2177
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:55,198
next couple questions ignore ignore a

2178
01:24:53,698 --> 01:24:57,919
few of these because there's nothing

2179
01:24:55,198 --> 01:25:00,539
yeah I can't I'm not gonna you know T

2180
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:03,480
tkogee Urkel Sour Diesel those are all

2181
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:05,340
their own longer things anyway uh do you

2182
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:07,139
think Mendo purp is possibly related to

2183
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:09,600
the purple skunk it was only available

2184
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:11,579
in the original 85 catalog and it being

2185
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,960
inbred for eight years and the sativa

2186
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:14,460
effects of the purple Hindu Kush type

2187
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,719
plant with those purple flower sounds

2188
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,880
similar

2189
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:20,219
you know

2190
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,859
um like a lot of 90s stuff that you get

2191
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:24,500
uh the lineage and the back story that

2192
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:27,299
you would prefer to come along with it

2193
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:29,039
uh is not there

2194
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:31,260
um the only information that I have that

2195
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:34,140
I think is factual about the Mendo perps

2196
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:37,020
is that the guy that I got it from grew

2197
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:39,960
it in the late 70s in kovalo which is a

2198
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:41,400
remote Valley in Mendocino County I

2199
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,399
don't know anything other about it

2200
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:46,439
besides that I don't know purple isn't

2201
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:48,420
there I mean there you know there was

2202
01:25:46,439 --> 01:25:50,158
it's sort of a pipeline you know and

2203
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:52,199
part of the reason why part of the I

2204
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:54,179
should say this too is that a lot of

2205
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:56,158
land race stuff that we were talking

2206
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:58,679
about a lot of it tested between seven

2207
01:25:56,158 --> 01:26:00,359
and fifteen percent THC and it was

2208
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:02,279
really the blending of these various

2209
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:04,439
land races and Afghans and these

2210
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:06,479
hybridizations that really started

2211
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:10,079
bumping us up into the higher teens

2212
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:12,299
lower 20s mid-20s type of thing and so

2213
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:14,039
the Mendo perps while it has amazing

2214
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:16,199
qualities

2215
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:19,560
um it has very low THC it's probably

2216
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:22,319
somewhere between 8 and 12 percent if

2217
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:25,139
they're not bumping it up which actually

2218
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:27,479
kind of lends it lends to its truth that

2219
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:28,980
it could be an original land race

2220
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:31,259
brought over

2221
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:32,879
um but I don't have a regional origin uh

2222
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:34,440
the only thing I've ever smelled in my

2223
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,619
entire life that smelled like the Mendo

2224
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:40,219
perps was The Nepalese Temple balls that

2225
01:26:37,619 --> 01:26:42,779
I got from hash smugglers in Amsterdam

2226
01:26:40,219 --> 01:26:44,760
absolutely I've thought that it might be

2227
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:47,460
Nepalese because of that but I have

2228
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,440
absolutely zero evidence pointing one

2229
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,920
way or the other other than the fact

2230
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:51,919
that it's purple

2231
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:57,420
I don't think it's purple skunk simply

2232
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:00,839
because Matt and I have grown tons of

2233
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:03,179
skunks various kinds it doesn't really

2234
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,039
have any other skunk characteristics I

2235
01:27:03,179 --> 01:27:07,800
think Urkel is purple skunk I really

2236
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:10,738
genuinely do I know uh CSI probably I

2237
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:13,079
think he's uh more akin to something x18

2238
01:27:10,738 --> 01:27:15,119
or ptk something like that I think it's

2239
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:16,679
purple skunk one Urkel but I do not

2240
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:18,059
think Mendo purposes purpose kind of

2241
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:19,859
corn

2242
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:22,500
um okay so here's some funny ones what's

2243
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:26,059
my favorite color in weed

2244
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,060
uh you know uh

2245
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:34,500
okay here's the thing I do think that

2246
01:27:32,939 --> 01:27:36,719
purple is extremely physically

2247
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,840
attractive to look at I do think that

2248
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:42,359
the cookies and that the stuff from DJ

2249
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:44,940
Short and his son JD can be extremely

2250
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:46,380
beautiful the lavenders the pinks the

2251
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:48,319
blues

2252
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:52,319
um I think the Mendo perps is beautiful

2253
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:55,198
do I think that those kinds of weed uh

2254
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:56,219
are as potent and as strong as the green

2255
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:57,539
weed

2256
01:27:56,219 --> 01:27:58,380
no

2257
01:27:57,539 --> 01:28:01,019
no no

2258
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:03,420
so if you like very light to moderate

2259
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:05,820
potency it could be your thing but

2260
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:07,980
literally every potent strain that I

2261
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:10,920
hold and care for

2262
01:28:07,979 --> 01:28:13,638
um is some shade of green yeah I I want

2263
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:16,199
to see purples I need that oh my god um

2264
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:18,239
I would love people I would love people

2265
01:28:16,198 --> 01:28:21,178
to breed an extremely high potent

2266
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:23,698
potency purple I haven't seen it I've

2267
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:26,100
seen a few the the purple unicorn was

2268
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:28,319
the chemd Blackberry Widow from JoJo

2269
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:30,539
Rizo it was the first time I got candy

2270
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:32,639
potency in a just Stark purple plant

2271
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:34,139
yeah I'm sure it could exist I'm just

2272
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,239
saying as far as most purple things

2273
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:38,579
you're aware of it's not common no they

2274
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,799
tend to be they tend to be lighter yeah

2275
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:42,600
uh this is a good one the the Golden Age

2276
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,920
of Canada I like that question quite a

2277
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,199
bit

2278
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,239
I'm gonna you know I'll I'll talk about

2279
01:28:46,198 --> 01:28:49,919
this one for a minute because this one's

2280
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:52,198
kind of dear to my heart and maybe it's

2281
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:55,199
just because I was young but I think the

2282
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:56,879
90s was the Golden Age of cannabis

2283
01:28:55,198 --> 01:28:58,619
um you know I still think that we could

2284
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,560
go into another golden age I don't think

2285
01:28:58,619 --> 01:29:03,179
it's like it's it's unachievable but the

2286
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,920
reason I think it was the golden age is

2287
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:06,239
because it was like the first poly

2288
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,300
hybrid era

2289
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:11,519
right things were less inbred

2290
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:13,320
um you know there was a lot more f1s and

2291
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:16,440
various poly hybrids coming out that

2292
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:19,799
were quite potent and the you know the

2293
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:21,960
chems the sour diesels the nl5 hazes

2294
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:25,260
like most of our Fame like very

2295
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:28,079
extremely famous the the cushes they all

2296
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:31,739
originate from that era and people are

2297
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:33,359
still using a lot of 90s cuts

2298
01:29:31,738 --> 01:29:35,279
um in their breed work

2299
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:37,079
they're some of the most common cuts to

2300
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:40,439
use they're sort of the backbone of our

2301
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:42,179
modern industry is 90s cuts and the

2302
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:44,579
other thing I think that makes 90s Cuts

2303
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:46,619
different is that 90s was the last era

2304
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:48,658
before the The Name Game

2305
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:50,880
and then Matt can speak to this

2306
01:29:48,658 --> 01:29:53,460
extensively but one of the downsides to

2307
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:55,679
the name game is that every time a

2308
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:59,039
famous name or a famous craze happens

2309
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:01,260
with cannabis so many cool unique things

2310
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:04,019
that were easy to sell

2311
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,940
before get pushed to the Wayside because

2312
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,659
as soon as something becomes not easy to

2313
01:30:05,939 --> 01:30:08,279
sell

2314
01:30:06,658 --> 01:30:10,439
the amount of people that are willing to

2315
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:11,519
hold on to it becomes tiny

2316
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:12,658
so

2317
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,340
you know

2318
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:16,439
um I'll give you guys a perfect example

2319
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:19,619
you know I live in Mendocino County when

2320
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:22,439
the when the purple craze hit in o40506

2321
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:26,340
and everybody wanted to grow Grape Ape

2322
01:30:22,439 --> 01:30:28,198
Urkel lavender uh you know so on and so

2323
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:30,000
forth there was all these Hill people

2324
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:31,859
that had been growing all these killer

2325
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,899
strains for a long time and easily

2326
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:36,839
selling them and then they couldn't sell

2327
01:30:33,899 --> 01:30:39,479
them and their neighbor was like hey

2328
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,579
you grow this Urkel I'll sell as many of

2329
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:43,919
them as you can get every gram every

2330
01:30:41,579 --> 01:30:45,539
gram will go give me your Urkel and so

2331
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,819
all these strains start to get dropped

2332
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:50,100
and so a lot a lot of the reasons why we

2333
01:30:47,819 --> 01:30:52,019
still breed with 90s work is because

2334
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,760
that's when the that's before the

2335
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:55,980
bottlenecking happened

2336
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,900
and now if you look at what people are

2337
01:30:55,979 --> 01:31:00,779
selling now all these Boutique breeders

2338
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:03,539
every famous thing gets crossed to every

2339
01:31:00,779 --> 01:31:05,399
famous thing yeah so sour got crossed to

2340
01:31:03,539 --> 01:31:07,800
everything Kush got crossed to

2341
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:09,960
everything cookies got crossed to

2342
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,639
everything Skittles

2343
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,859
you name it then they start getting

2344
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:17,340
crossed to each other from both sides

2345
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:20,279
again yeah Schmitz by this by this you

2346
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:23,819
know Cherry Pie by cushman's by wedding

2347
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:25,139
cake by and it's all the same blend of

2348
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:28,340
the same

2349
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:30,539
30 Cuts unintentional inbreeding

2350
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:31,920
unintentional inbreeding because and

2351
01:31:30,539 --> 01:31:33,899
that's and I don't mean to call out

2352
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:37,699
breeders because that's what the public

2353
01:31:33,899 --> 01:31:37,698
wants yeah yeah two

2354
01:31:37,738 --> 01:31:42,539
um Soma definitely all in Soma

2355
01:31:39,539 --> 01:31:44,600
definitely had some worthwhile offerings

2356
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:48,060
um his lavender stuff was worthwhile

2357
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:50,940
declining Buddha his reclining Buddha he

2358
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:52,860
got he got some G13 by Haze a from

2359
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:55,138
Neville that he used as a male in some

2360
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:56,880
of his sativa lines and a lot of that

2361
01:31:55,139 --> 01:31:59,100
came out to produce a lot of the CBD

2362
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,319
lines later on that G13 Hayes Mill yeah

2363
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:04,980
so uh you know when I used to go to

2364
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:06,779
Amsterdam uh you could buy his his Bud

2365
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:09,539
from the dam cring which was one of the

2366
01:32:06,779 --> 01:32:10,859
nicer coffee shops in Amsterdam he grew

2367
01:32:09,539 --> 01:32:13,139
good weed

2368
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:15,179
um some of his weed was quite popular it

2369
01:32:13,139 --> 01:32:17,880
was a little different

2370
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:19,679
um that's because he kicked it first

2371
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:21,960
you know I try to be nice to people but

2372
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,760
he was he was a little notorious for

2373
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,560
potentially running his YouTube Tumblr

2374
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,239
for two or three minutes before he put

2375
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:29,400
it in the bag to sell different things

2376
01:32:27,238 --> 01:32:32,158
so he could collect the Keith that's for

2377
01:32:29,399 --> 01:32:36,238
real uh who is a legitimate source for

2378
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:38,039
nl1 NL seeds the problem when I

2379
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:39,899
mentioned earlier on the podcast which

2380
01:32:38,039 --> 01:32:42,779
is like every five or ten years we'd

2381
01:32:39,899 --> 01:32:44,879
reinvents itself you can go look at

2382
01:32:42,779 --> 01:32:47,880
almost all of these catalogs from the

2383
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,579
90s and it is almost impossible to find

2384
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,300
the vast majority of these lines in seed

2385
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:55,139
form

2386
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:57,840
yeah unhybridized pure skunk you know I

2387
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:59,159
mean it just is it's it sucks to say it

2388
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,139
but

2389
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:04,019
um every 10 years stuff becomes rare

2390
01:33:01,139 --> 01:33:06,359
that's the 90s now that's you know 25

2391
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:07,560
years ago plus

2392
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:10,279
um most of the stuff that was available

2393
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:12,600
in the 90s is no longer available today

2394
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:15,059
you can't get it

2395
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,860
um it exists in various hybrids I have I

2396
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:20,699
have a tendency to think that Bubba Kush

2397
01:33:16,859 --> 01:33:22,380
is has heavy nl1 influence

2398
01:33:20,698 --> 01:33:25,379
um you know so I think some of this

2399
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:27,060
stuff exists in different names

2400
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:29,340
um but that's the sad part if you don't

2401
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:32,520
buy it and store it uh you might want it

2402
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:35,279
later on and you can't get it yep

2403
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:37,080
history of the 1979 Christmas tree I'm

2404
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:40,619
gonna skip that one maybe I don't know

2405
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:41,698
it maybe if CSI comes on at some point

2406
01:33:40,619 --> 01:33:46,019
um

2407
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:48,960
uh aspiring breeders

2408
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,520
um oh I'll uh skip that one too not

2409
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,579
because not because it's a bad question

2410
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:55,620
but it's kind of complicated yeah I

2411
01:33:53,579 --> 01:33:58,019
haven't heard of any bud called UFO in

2412
01:33:55,619 --> 01:34:00,139
Florida nope

2413
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,139
um

2414
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:05,579
I don't know anything about freeze

2415
01:34:03,658 --> 01:34:08,460
drying cannabis I know there's companies

2416
01:34:05,579 --> 01:34:10,920
out there you know uh there's there's

2417
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:13,920
companies that are that are claiming

2418
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:16,020
that freeze drying is amazing uh I have

2419
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:18,539
specific methods of drying and it

2420
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:20,639
certainly doesn't involve freeze drying

2421
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:22,560
uh here's a good one when and who

2422
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:24,539
started making feminized seeds Dutch

2423
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,100
Passion off uh gives themselves credit

2424
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:28,260
for it but it was actually a man named

2425
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:30,900
Mohan RAM and I can't remember something

2426
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:33,179
set as ett that we're first doing the

2427
01:34:30,899 --> 01:34:36,679
the scientific experiment experiments on

2428
01:34:33,179 --> 01:34:40,880
plant reversal using Cobalt colloidal

2429
01:34:36,679 --> 01:34:40,880
SDS and several other methods

2430
01:34:41,579 --> 01:34:44,519
um

2431
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:46,739
okay so here's something that's

2432
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:49,500
interesting

2433
01:34:46,738 --> 01:34:51,059
um I uh we'll skip a couple of these not

2434
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,380
because they're not nice questions but I

2435
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:55,320
don't know anything about the New York

2436
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:57,000
recreational uh rules or anything like

2437
01:34:55,319 --> 01:35:01,679
that I don't know anything about the new

2438
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:03,658
uh uh attorney general for our state yet

2439
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:05,460
um you know

2440
01:35:03,658 --> 01:35:07,799
uh

2441
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:08,880
Central American cannabis what's the

2442
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,779
importance of it I mean it's very

2443
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,480
important

2444
01:35:09,779 --> 01:35:14,880
um Mexican is is Central America

2445
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:16,259
uh and Mexican has been bred into all

2446
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,239
kinds of stuff

2447
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:20,820
um that we use uh the other essential

2448
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:23,218
American countries not so much

2449
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:25,198
um it does exist but it certainly didn't

2450
01:35:23,219 --> 01:35:26,460
have the impact in terms of breeders

2451
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:29,460
working with it there's certainly

2452
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:32,520
Honduran and El Salvadorian and you know

2453
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:34,859
that kind of thing Panama's also is also

2454
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:36,960
technically Central

2455
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:39,599
um is also technically Central America

2456
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,639
so uh the two famous ones from Central

2457
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,139
America that have a lot of influence and

2458
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:45,480
have been bred into a bunch are Mexican

2459
01:35:43,139 --> 01:35:46,859
and Panamanian yeah

2460
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:51,718
um

2461
01:35:46,859 --> 01:35:54,719
let's see cubing cubing is sort of bxing

2462
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:56,179
in a way it's kind of [ __ ] concept

2463
01:35:54,719 --> 01:36:00,119
but

2464
01:35:56,179 --> 01:36:01,500
yeah cubing is is great if you have a

2465
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:05,099
true F1

2466
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:07,020
and you want to isolate a single one or

2467
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,639
two traits that that that's effective

2468
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:10,739
and then you Cube then you then you

2469
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,179
cross forward that's that's generally

2470
01:36:10,738 --> 01:36:14,759
how it works

2471
01:36:12,179 --> 01:36:17,158
um however I always give this example

2472
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:19,560
every time uh people tend to think of

2473
01:36:17,158 --> 01:36:21,960
c99 when they hear cubing because it was

2474
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:24,000
back crossed three or four times

2475
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:25,980
um can't remember what the claim was

2476
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,738
from Seoul but it was all [ __ ]

2477
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:30,419
anyways but in a sense it's in a sense

2478
01:36:28,738 --> 01:36:32,759
you don't want to take a line that has

2479
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:34,199
[ __ ] a thousand phinos and try to

2480
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:35,940
cube it you're not going to get anywhere

2481
01:36:34,198 --> 01:36:38,460
in four steps back

2482
01:36:35,939 --> 01:36:39,960
to isolate all the trades like that and

2483
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,899
a lot of people confuse that cubing

2484
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:45,420
isolate a few traits Crossing forward

2485
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:47,158
isolate multiple traits that's that's

2486
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:48,119
really the the best way I can describe

2487
01:36:47,158 --> 01:36:49,559
it

2488
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:51,119
um that kind of ends most of the

2489
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:53,639
questions I think for this week There's

2490
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:54,599
a few we didn't get to Urkel is potent

2491
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:58,039
no

2492
01:36:54,600 --> 01:37:00,360
I don't think Urkel is super potentially

2493
01:36:58,039 --> 01:37:02,100
but other people might think so I

2494
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:03,420
definitely think it's one of them I

2495
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,460
think it's one of the more potent

2496
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:07,800
purples but I would not put it up

2497
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:09,719
against the more I would not even

2498
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:12,719
remotely it wouldn't be in my top 10 or

2499
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:13,819
even 20 uh most potent strains that I've

2500
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:16,260
tried

2501
01:37:13,819 --> 01:37:19,259
it's one of the top ten that will

2502
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:20,600
instantly get me paranoia anytime I mean

2503
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:24,000
you know

2504
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:25,679
see it's just the way it goes with my

2505
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,600
brain yeah there's a guy there's a

2506
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,399
there's a gentleman asking about do you

2507
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,900
think land race seeds are still good at

2508
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:32,039
the source

2509
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:34,738
um you know if I don't know anything

2510
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:36,840
about those guys but I certainly support

2511
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:37,919
people going around in Afghanistan and

2512
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,480
Pakistan

2513
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:41,579
is he talking about a specific company

2514
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:43,500
or is he talking about I think there is

2515
01:37:41,579 --> 01:37:46,139
a company called land race seeds that

2516
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:48,000
bring stuff over from Afghanistan and

2517
01:37:46,139 --> 01:37:49,980
Pakistan

2518
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,380
um it's not that easy for white people

2519
01:37:49,979 --> 01:37:54,359
to go there and collect things right now

2520
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:55,859
I mean when we went to war with them for

2521
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:58,079
a couple decades and so it's a little

2522
01:37:55,859 --> 01:37:59,939
sketchy at the Taliban and stuff and so

2523
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:01,800
the fact that you have people that are

2524
01:37:59,939 --> 01:38:03,839
going to collect and send seeds I don't

2525
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:06,239
know what will come of it but it's

2526
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,779
definitely an access point

2527
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:11,459
um and we'll go from there uh you know

2528
01:38:09,779 --> 01:38:14,460
and uh

2529
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,899
the difference in early Colombian Haze

2530
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:17,760
I think the difference in early

2531
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:20,399
Colombian Haze and why it was better was

2532
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,679
it was just raw crosses and less inbred

2533
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:25,019
I think there was a lot of mistakes made

2534
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:26,760
in the 70s on accident as people learned

2535
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:30,239
they didn't use large enough population

2536
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:32,280
sizes I think it's been documented that

2537
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:34,319
a lot of the best females that the haze

2538
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:37,139
guys liked started disappearing in the

2539
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:39,899
mid to late 70s because they made some

2540
01:38:37,139 --> 01:38:42,719
some poor choices with selections and

2541
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:44,759
they weren't sure what they were doing

2542
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:46,980
um you know the South Indian stuff has

2543
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:49,980
kind of been debunked now Sam is saying

2544
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:52,500
that it was always Colo by Colo which is

2545
01:38:49,979 --> 01:38:54,658
Colombian by Colombian he's saying that

2546
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:57,840
the this four-way blend is a bunch of

2547
01:38:54,658 --> 01:39:02,759
bunk and it's not true

2548
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:04,440
um so uh I can't I can't speak to that

2549
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:07,440
um so I don't know you know I mean here

2550
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:10,019
we are as that's basically the end of

2551
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:11,819
the questions there's you know there's a

2552
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:12,739
guy that said that Mexico is North

2553
01:39:11,819 --> 01:39:16,380
America

2554
01:39:12,738 --> 01:39:18,178
uh I'm aware that uh that uh that they

2555
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:20,100
don't consider Central America continent

2556
01:39:18,179 --> 01:39:22,440
but since the question was asked about

2557
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,880
what came from Central America that was

2558
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:25,559
beneficial

2559
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,420
you know if people are talking about

2560
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,860
Central America it's pretty much Panama

2561
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,480
Mexico

2562
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:32,880
um I realize it's all either North or

2563
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:35,158
South America as the way that uh

2564
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,900
geography would work I was just trying

2565
01:39:35,158 --> 01:39:38,819
to answer the question

2566
01:39:36,899 --> 01:39:41,279
the Durbin stuff we're going to ignore

2567
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:42,960
simply yeah we have some stuff coming up

2568
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:45,300
that I think will shed a lot more light

2569
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:48,840
on the Durbin thing next week and so I

2570
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:50,000
don't want to chat on that two weeks two

2571
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,020
weeks something like something

2572
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,738
relatively close there'll be some really

2573
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:56,940
good new information

2574
01:39:54,738 --> 01:39:59,218
I think we could talk about it now since

2575
01:39:56,939 --> 01:40:00,178
it's most of it's in the can um is that

2576
01:39:59,219 --> 01:40:02,639
okay you want to talk about it real

2577
01:40:00,179 --> 01:40:04,139
quick just plug it yeah we could plug it

2578
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:07,139
really quick so

2579
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:09,719
um you know we uh we we were blessed and

2580
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:13,440
we have been able to interview

2581
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:15,960
um the the founder of super sativa seed

2582
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:18,299
club uh and

2583
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:20,760
um as part of our like 80s breeding

2584
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:22,380
program Neville's obviously passed so we

2585
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,239
weren't able to interview him but you

2586
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:27,420
know Neville and super sativa seed Club

2587
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:29,519
were the two largest ones and we have a

2588
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:31,319
quite long interview coming that we're

2589
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,000
going to be giving some context to where

2590
01:40:31,319 --> 01:40:35,579
we ask him a bunch of questions about

2591
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,840
some very famous trains what it was like

2592
01:40:35,579 --> 01:40:39,479
back then

2593
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:42,239
a lot of cool stuff a lot of stuff that

2594
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:44,698
surprised even Matt and myself uh new

2595
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:47,459
information he was super engaging and

2596
01:40:44,698 --> 01:40:49,379
cool I'm really excited about it we

2597
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:52,380
