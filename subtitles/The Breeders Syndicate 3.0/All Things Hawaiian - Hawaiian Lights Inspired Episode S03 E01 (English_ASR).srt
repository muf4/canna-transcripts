10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,280
hey what's up hey

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,839
yeah so oh oh

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,198
[ __ ] uh instagram blocked me because

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,760
someone's been reporting me i wonder who

14
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:03,198
i mean uh you're popular

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:06,798
i yeah yeah it could be any one of my my

16
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,319
loyal adoring fans so you know so we can

17
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,640
uh

18
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:14,959
yeah i mean it it's hard to to uh

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,959
um

20
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,920
it's definitely got the potential for

21
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,520
abuse

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
yeah i mean if

23
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,239
if you want to tell history you're going

24
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,520
to be pissing people off no matter what

25
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,359
you do no matter what you're talking

26
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,560
about no matter which subject it is

27
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,879
because there's always someone making

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
money off the subject you know

29
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,959
oh yeah there's people that are make

30
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,280
there's people that like

31
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,399
uh what is it the more mystery less

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,239
history

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
yes yes

34
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,759
that's like relationship advice but i

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
guess it comes into play with cannabis

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,560
you know it does it does i was thinking

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
like

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
even in ufos dude people go [ __ ] nuts

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
on each other when they don't

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
necessarily believe the same exact you

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
know thing

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,600
and and they report each other and they

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,920
get real nasty and like dox each other

44
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,078
and swat each other i mean everybody

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
likes science until it challenges their

46
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,438
assumptions

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,118
yeah there you go i mean it is you know

48
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,000
and it's rare

49
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,759
that

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
science is going to back you up on

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,239
everything that you believe

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
yeah yeah exactly oh wow we do have 80

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,520
people in here so that's a plus it is

54
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,680
like this account being much smaller

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,120
it's it's looks like it's popping up so

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
and it's only been a couple of minutes

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,439
so hopefully

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,598
uh more people pop on

59
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,680
and whatnot and i guess if if we're

60
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,359
interesting enough we'll have a podcast

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,439
on it or something too maybe so we'll

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,800
see yeah we'll see how it goes we'll see

63
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,840
how it goes

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
all right is there anything you wanted

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
to touch on early on

66
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,280
uh well i mean we kind of like uh we

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,519
were kind of going to have a grab bag of

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
things to chat about today we were going

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,159
to talk a little bit

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
since it kind of ties into what you and

71
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,199
csi have going on we were going to kind

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,199
of touch on

73
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,759
a little bit of hawaiian history and

74
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:01,119
what hawaiian means in general

75
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,120
in terms of cannabis you know yeah um

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,480
and uh you know and then we were gonna

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
then there was something that kind of

78
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,399
irritated both of us about terpenes and

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
some other stuff that we were gonna

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,959
[ __ ] about i think that's right i

81
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,679
printed this out too so so we can you

82
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,439
know so yeah you know um

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,680
so not too bad so maybe what we can do

84
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,959
we got 91 people in climbing so that's

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,280
pretty positive

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,680
yeah um so maybe what we can do is we'll

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,318
we'll keep off the the

88
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,959
semi-controversial stuff for a little

89
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:34,958
bit and we'll start on we'll start on

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,080
the on hawaiian right hawaii

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,560
hawaiian so uh so hawaiian is

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
interesting hawaii is a trippy place

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,759
because

94
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,359
i believe it's the farthest islands from

95
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,479
a continent

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,280
in the world

97
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,079
yeah

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
right

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
um of of one of the seven continents

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
it's the farthest it's the farthest

101
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,919
thing and so

102
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,719
um there are no

103
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,119
there's not much on hawaii that's native

104
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,959
yeah of any kind anything most things

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
are non-native to hawaii because it's

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,920
essentially a volcanic island chain in

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,799
the middle of nowhere right

108
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,158
um

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,799
but one of the interesting things about

110
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,199
hawaii hawaii is that

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,798
hawaii i believe is the only american

112
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,039
state that's actually in the tropics

113
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,319
oh yeah that would make sense so like

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,000
even even if you go down to like say um

115
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,560
florida like the very southern tip of

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,319
florida or the florida keys for instance

117
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,319
yeah those are still considered the

118
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,040
subtropics

119
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,159
yes not actual tropics yeah right what

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,160
about what about guam

121
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,879
you know guam is an estate

122
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,359
that's that's true yeah it's a territory

123
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,439
territory uh and i will admit that i'm

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,199
not familiar with all of america's

125
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,639
territories and where they may or may

126
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,478
not be located

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,240
yeah i only know that guam people are

128
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,918
called chamorin that's i learned that

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
because i had a friend that was from

130
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,560
guam and i said he was guamanian he got

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
real pissed but but i'll say this like

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,959
from the perspective that we're speaking

133
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
of

134
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,038
if you're doing something in the united

135
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,959
states and the 50 united states you

136
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,639
don't go through customs the same way as

137
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,519
if you're outside of it

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,478
yeah

139
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,799
so

140
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,879
um you know we've got this you know i i

141
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,879
don't have it but um they they're doing

142
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,399
some you know hawaiian lights and i have

143
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,839
a pretty old strain from hawaii and so

144
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,638
we thought we'd chat about what that

145
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,439
meant

146
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,960
so there is no wheat unlike most of what

147
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,279
we talk about where

148
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,000
mexican or colombian or panamanian or

149
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,000
thai or african or any of this [ __ ]

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,319
there really is no

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,319
record of marijuana in hawaii

152
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,360
um much before

153
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,560
you know

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,400
the 60s or something yeah you know um so

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,038
there's not like there wasn't really any

156
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,638
indigenous cultures cultivating it there

157
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:53,599
yeah right

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
and

159
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
so there's an aspect where

160
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,038
um

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,800
you know it's rumored uh and they

162
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,639
certainly were involved that the

163
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,038
brotherhood of eternal love

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,918
yeah that was one of the locations that

165
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,959
they used to grow cannabis um before

166
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,198
helicopters flew yeah and

167
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,599
so as a result of that a lot of the

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,360
common strains back then uh mexican

169
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
colombian that kind of thing could be

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,280
grown successfully out there yeah even

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,759
today in hawaii um most people if they

172
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,879
want to grow in hawaii they veg

173
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
indoors

174
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,600
or in greenhouses with artificial

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,079
lighting

176
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,800
because it's it's basically so close to

177
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,639
1212 there all the time that anything

178
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
that we normally grow in our in in our

179
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,720
stuff unless it's some kind of pure

180
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,960
equatorial sativa would flower

181
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,800
immediately upon going outside

182
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,959
oh wow i didn't know that

183
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,160
yeah i mean it's it's it's you know i

184
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,638
mean that's part of the reason why

185
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,800
equatorials take so long yeah is they

186
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,400
don't have any like wintertime pressure

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,360
where they have to create seed before

188
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,598
they die

189
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,439
yeah it's always kind of warm and nice

190
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,439
and there's not you know you take

191
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,120
afghanistan or hindu kush or something

192
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,879
like that where there's a pretty good

193
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,918
amount of difference between daytime and

194
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,598
nighttime versus summer and winter and

195
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,918
in the equatorial regions there's not a

196
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,199
big difference yeah it might be a couple

197
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,120
of hours

198
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,439
yeah right um and so you might be 12 12

199
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,319
or you might be 13 and 11 or you might

200
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,639
be 11 and 13 but you don't really vary

201
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,840
much beyond that little

202
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,199
aspect

203
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,839
yeah um

204
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,840
so hawaiian hawaiian it basically is a

205
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,839
catch-all term for anything

206
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,719
in hawaii

207
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,598
yeah

208
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,599
right yeah uh and what apparently what

209
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,478
used to be grown out there

210
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,240
was some combination of colombians

211
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,758
mexicans ties

212
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,079
and uh

213
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,160
um and then some of that stuff was mixed

214
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,159
with afghans

215
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,479
for structure and weight and this and

216
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,160
that you know and and all that type of

217
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,120
stuff so

218
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,199
um

219
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,598
you know when when for instance like

220
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,759
they were talking about you know the the

221
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,560
stuff that seattle greg and those guys

222
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,400
were getting in the 70s or 80s that they

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
were mixing with their afghans they were

224
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,598
getting hawaiian

225
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,918
right

226
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:17,279
but you know that was probably some

227
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,038
combination of colombian thai mexican uh

228
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,239
blended together

229
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,439
and or maybe mixed with afghan

230
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,079
yeah

231
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,598
is kind of is kind of that you know and

232
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,800
so

233
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,240
um hawaii used to be a pretty bomb place

234
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,879
to grow cannabis

235
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,360
uh and then the problem became is when

236
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,158
the helicopters started flying in the

237
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,240
early 80s and stuff um there's not very

238
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,958
much land mass in hawaii

239
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,799
yeah so it's not it it's not like

240
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,958
northern california or other areas where

241
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,759
they just have this vast area to search

242
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,639
through

243
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,159
yeah there's you know volcanic areas

244
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,799
that it's really easy to see if there's

245
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,519
a weed growing there's jungle areas that

246
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,799
are unsuitable there's only so many you

247
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,200
know human area human habitation areas

248
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,319
and so the area they have to cover is

249
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
pretty small

250
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
yeah it wouldn't be too hard to just

251
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,720
fly up a little bit and see there was a

252
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,080
big boom in the 60s and 70s of people

253
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,120
growing out there

254
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,080
and then as soon as the helicopters

255
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,000
started flying a lot of people got a lot

256
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,240
you know hawaii kind of ceased being an

257
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,320
export place

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
on any major level i'm not saying that

259
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,080
it wasn't some of it still didn't exist

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,240
but a lot of it moved into green houses

261
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,560
it moved on to the edge of jungles it

262
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,399
became really difficult to get off any

263
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,079
kind of large-scale stuff

264
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,080
yeah because the islands are so small so

265
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,160
when matt did his interview with with

266
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,080
greg i think was the very first breeder

267
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,958
syndicate interview

268
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,120
um

269
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,439
you know he talked about he thought that

270
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,200
the hawaiian that they were using in nl5

271
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,360
was some blend of

272
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,640
mexican and colombian

273
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,159
yeah

274
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,319
was his was his

275
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,639
take on it yeah that was his take some

276
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,480
kind of mexican colombian which would

277
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,199
have been uh pretty common because that

278
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,039
would have been two of the main imports

279
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,879
seeded weed imports that were coming

280
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,838
into america at the time

281
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,799
yeah

282
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,399
right

283
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:19,759
um and uh you know and so i have a small

284
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,879
tie to uh to hawaiian not that i lived

285
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,159
there or anything like that because i

286
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,799
never did but

287
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,639
um one of the strains that i still have

288
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,319
is we call it the maui

289
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:33,679
and of all places i met a guy from maui

290
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,800
in the in 94 in amsterdam who would come

291
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,399
out there to

292
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,278
trade seeds with some of the breeders

293
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,958
out there

294
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,399
and we shared a joint and stuff like

295
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,559
that and i was with some friends and he

296
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,879
gave us a small handful of seeds

297
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,199
and uh one of them became the mount

298
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,879
so they have truck stops in

299
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,839
hawaii is what you're saying

300
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:55,278
so or i mean amsterdam i mean so they uh

301
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,279
they i mean they have a whole district

302
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,560
district you know they don't even have

303
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,278
they don't even call it they just they

304
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,599
just it's very much more open there so

305
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,159
um and so being 19 or whatever the [ __ ]

306
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
i was i asked zero intelligent questions

307
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,439
of this man

308
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,360
uh i thought he was a super old timer

309
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,760
which he was probably about my age he

310
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,480
was probably mid-forties but to 19 year

311
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,879
old

312
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
yeah he seemed a grizzled veteran yeah

313
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,639
i'm sure you know

314
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,200
and that trip i spent thousands of

315
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,439
dollars on seeds uh and the only thing

316
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
that i ended up keeping was this female

317
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,040
from a handful of seeds that he gave me

318
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
when we shared a joint

319
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,838
wow

320
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,199
it was pretty good about the dutch stuff

321
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,760
out of all the dutch

322
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,839
that particular trip uh which was was

323
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,759
one it was my it was actually my first

324
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,720
trip to amsterdam believe it or not in

325
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,278
94. um that particular trip

326
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,800
um i didn't find anything that was a

327
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,480
keeper amongst the stuff that i bought

328
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,319

00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,958
you know i i

339
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,839
i think i bought some bubble gum that

340
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,719
year

341
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,079
yeah um i bought i bought a a random i

342
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
bought some stuff from maybe dutch

343
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,679
passion

344
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,320
anyway i was stupid um and instead of

345
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,000
buying well i was 19 right so instead of

346
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,800
buying like three or four things and

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,159
buying like you know 50 seeds of each

348
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,559
thing yeah i bought like 15 or 18 things

349
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,399
and like one or two packs of each yeah

350
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,159
right so then you like crack a pack and

351
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,240
it's 10 seeds and you get four females

352
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,000
and you don't like any of them yeah and

353
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,839
i was that wasn't at the era i was so

354
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,919
young then that wasn't at the era where

355
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,000
we were like keeping males or breeding

356
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,599
or anything like that right

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,839
um so that's the other thing too is i

358
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,879
got that maui and we tossed all the

359
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,200
males because they were [ __ ] useless

360
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,120
right what are we gonna do with those

361
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,360
you know um

362
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,480
but uh but so hawaiian hawaiian is

363
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,159
definitely

364
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,120
you know in that it's kind of it's in

365
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,919
the lexicon right and you know someone

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,519
just said oh maui wowie uh maui wowie

367
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,679
was is kind of like

368
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,000
madness [ __ ] or this or that or

369
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,278
whatever it's a catch-all term

370
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,278
it was

371
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,838
it was originally

372
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,120
made by a guy named fast eddie from the

373
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
brotherhood of eternal love so there

374
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,278
really was a maui wowie at one time

375
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,439
unlike madness [ __ ] we can't

376
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,240
trace it to one person but that one we

377
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,160
can but what has become maui wowie i

378
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,360
think most of what we see is maui wowie

379
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:40,078
are mostly afghan dominant types

380
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,879
um you know they used to uh they used to

381
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,919
ship

382
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,320
uh some of that stuff in macadamia nuts

383
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,838
oh wow they did they used to ship it to

384
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,399
the states they used to hide it in the

385
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,199
center of macadamia nut tins yeah that's

386
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,839
funny and stuff like that and so

387
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,519
you know hawaiian was sort of a was sort

388
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,199
of a catch-all phrase there is no

389
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,159
indigenous hawaiian

390
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,599
yeah right it was all basically

391
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,039
entrepreneurs

392
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,639
bringing other indigenous weed to hawaii

393
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,120
and trying to figure out how to get

394
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,440
worthwhile buds

395
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,440
is basically what it boiled down to

396
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,440
um and uh you know what's interesting

397
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
about like the the hawaiian that i have

398
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,399
the what we call them and the only

399
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,000
reason why we call it the maui

400
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,320
is because i was dumb and i didn't ask

401
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,919
any [ __ ] questions so

402
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
uh the only thing that we knew was the

403
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,120
dude was from maui

404
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,759
yeah

405
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,759
um but that's it right i met fast eddie

406
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,919
i doubt you met you met fast eddie um

407
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,198
because uh the fast daddy that you

408
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,399
probably met was a very famous dude from

409
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,278
dead tour

410
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,919
uh

411
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,919
who is part of the wrecking crew

412
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,639
uh maybe you met fast betty from the

413
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,479
brotherhood of eternal love but around

414
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,320
but yeah i've never been able to get a

415
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,000
hold of him i've tried a lot but the

416
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,399
fact the fast eddy that most people are

417
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,278
familiar with um is from the wrecking

418
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,360
crew he was he was a pretty famous uh

419
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,198
person on he goes yeah that guy it was

420
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,240
it was a pretty famous dude on deadlot

421
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,319
if you went to dead tour uh on any level

422
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,959
um you probably heard him be like dow

423
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,720
says he had the deepest voice dow says

424
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,159
he would scream at little kids and stuff

425
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,879
and they were all drunk and they were

426
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,319
just a mess but anyway

427
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,159
um

428
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,399
so there's an aspect where

429
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,120
uh you know so that's hawaiian hawaiian

430
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,278
is anything that got brought to hawaii

431
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,759
and got grown there

432
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,600
yeah basically right yeah um and then it

433
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,199
just gets the name hawaiian and just

434
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,278
like a lot of like we've talked about

435
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,679
this before but just like a lot of stuff

436
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,600
where it obscures like we give nicknames

437
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,519
to things and it obscures the origin of

438
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,159
where it came from yeah that's what

439
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,278
hawaiian did you know seattle grey got

440
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,198
hawaiian

441
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,679
which isn't very helpful

442
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,879
did he get pure mexican pure colombian a

443
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,239
blend a blend with afghan

444
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,799
he didn't know

445
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,959
yeah they they said they could tell was

446
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,479
after mexican colombian because that's

447
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,879
the best being hotel was mexican

448
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,399
colombia you know and so

449
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,919
you know um

450
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,198
and so that's what got blended in and

451
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,479
back then uh especially you know nobody

452
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,159
knew that all this stuff was gonna be

453
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,759
famous and lineage and all that was

454
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,480
gonna get poured over and be super

455
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,680
important right yeah and notes were a

456
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,278
bad thing

457
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,919
so it is like saying oh i got the

458
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,919
californian yeah there was a california

459
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,679
indica that made it around amsterdam i

460
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,439
got the california you know it's about

461
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,799
it like gives you an idea of where the

462
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,839
area was from

463
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,120
right

464
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,160
and so

465
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,679
um you know what's interesting is that

466
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,319
being that i'm not from hawaii and i

467
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,399
don't really have any ties there um

468
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,320
i do have we i do have some good friends

469
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,639
that grew up on the island on various

470
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,600
islands and grown there their whole life

471
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,120
yeah and when i showed them um pictures

472
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,360
and flowers of uh my maui cut they did

473
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,360
say that there was that wasn't that

474
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,440
uncommon of a phenotype that they had

475
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,278
seen in the past in hawaiian that they

476
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,679
had grown from the past

477
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,798
yeah you know um so hawaii is sort of

478
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,319
like a catch-all from people get stuff

479
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:11,679
you know i mean like like there was even

480
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,240
a thing we were talking about a couple

481
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,038
episodes ago during the chem dog episode

482
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,439
where

483
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,599
um there's a maui

484
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,240
yeah why is it called maui dog because

485
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,159
someone got a supposedly a dog bud seed

486
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,400
and took it to maui

487
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,880
yeah popped it on maui and now it's maui

488
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,600
dog you know so the interesting thing

489
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,600
there's some pictures of maui on my page

490
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,719
it's really interesting it's huge it's

491
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,639
chunky

492
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,880
uh it's pretty short it's got a bunch of

493
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,038
afghan influence but if you look at it

494
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,480
uh the leaves are incredibly skinny and

495
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,359
double serrated

496
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,079
yeah

497
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,079
there's that

498
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,440
uh

499
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:53,918
is my audio kicking out ooh

500
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,360
it's just on my back off from your

501
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,720

kinda i mean we can hear you but it's

503
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,240
just off from your speaking you look

504
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,840
like you're in a kung fu movie i look

505
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,839
like i'm on a kung fu is it better now

506
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,279
no but it'll work it'll work so sorry

507
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,679
that uh sorry that it's ad-libbed or

508
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,519
whatever like i'm i'm dubbed

509
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,519
uh hopefully that changes but um

510
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:21,359
but yeah so my maui

511
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:24,639
uh is you know csi is always looking to

512
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,399
um do things that match right and so in

513
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,320
addition to my headband you know i've

514
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,960
shared a bunch of stuff with him in the

515
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:33,359
hopes that he would breed it uh and it

516
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
would get out to a wider audience a bit

517
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:39,119
and um one of the things that's going to

518
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,000
get dropped with matt and and csi is

519
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,558
um

520
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,880
my maui by the hawaiian lights i think

521
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:48,079
it's i don't know if that one or maui by

522
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,400
nl5 it might be just be it might be maui

523
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,199
yeah but anyway he used it so

524
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,038
um you know and so there's an aspect too

525
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,038
where it's like

526
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,279
you know uh it's it's been out there

527
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,119
before there's a cut from uh mandelbrot

528
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,918
called the truth

529
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,079
which is uh maui by superdog that i made

530
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,160
20 plus years ago or something like that

531
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,678
um so it's percolated around and it's

532
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,759
kind of been a mendo it's been a

533
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,080
mendocino county classic

534
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,079
because it's uh probably not now with

535
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,159
the way the market is but for a long

536
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,480
time it was one of those cuts that you

537
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,160
could put outside reliably get four or

538
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,839
five pounds off it and it would be done

539
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
in the middle of october yeah

540
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,080
you know decent that's very decent and

541
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,519
it's pretty i remember i remember seeing

542
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,119
pictures of it i've never uh i don't

543
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,480
think i've ever smoked maui but i've

544
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,159
never seen pictures of it and thinking

545
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,000
it was absolutely gorgeous especially

546
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,240
for an outdoor plant yeah and it turns

547
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,079
purple in the cold you know and stuff

548
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,160
like that and it's obviously some kind

549
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,480
of sativa afghan blend because if you

550
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,640
look at the buds and the density and how

551
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,200
quick it finishes it's got a heavy

552
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,280
afghan you know but its leaves are like

553
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,120
that's i mean it's like super skinny

554
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,879
leaves they don't even fatten really

555
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,239
they're just like consistently skinny

556
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,320
the whole way down and they've got a

557
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,079
bunch of double serrations

558
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,038
what's it smell like

559
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,279
um

560
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,519
you know it smells kind of

561
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,839
it smell i mean it's one of those ones

562
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,440
where when i asked oh god let's not do

563
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,959
that yet because i'll get all irritated

564
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,400
uh it

565
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,079
it's one of those ones where i've asked

566
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,919
trimmers for years and years what it

567
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,038
smells like yeah

568
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,240
and you get ranges from my favorite is

569
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,079
uh you know wrigley uh wrigley fruity

570
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
gum

571
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:31,359
that's a good smell you know um it's got

572
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,280
a super distinctive smell and i will say

573
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,240
jokingly that it's uh i joke that it's

574
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,119
like my longest female relationship

575
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,759
because

576
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,239
we popped that seed in 1994

577
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,599
yeah and i still have it

578
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
so she's

579
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,879
uh

580
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,240
28 years this year

581
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,480
28. yeah [ __ ] old yeah that's really

582
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,759
old it's [ __ ] old and so i've had her

583
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,880
literally i

584
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,038
she was the next to the crystal chunk

585
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,159
um she was the second weed that i ever

586
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,400
really started religiously cropping

587
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,480
yeah um and if you're in indiana or

588
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,159
chicago or illinois area and you ever

589
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,839
smoked the maui it's very likely it's

590
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,360
the same cut

591
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,759
because that's where we cropped it first

592
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,119
and a bunch of friends um grew it out

593
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,919
there and probably still grow it here

594
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,158
and there you know yeah it's not elite

595
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,640
by today's standards in terms of like

596
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
the high but it's probably it's kind of

597
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,600
good high

598
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,679
but it's it's not up there with the best

599
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,359
of the best in my opinion you know but

600
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,000
yeah it's got a bunch of amazing

601
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,158
qualities and it it's um

602
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,558
you know it breeds really well for for

603
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,080
color and frost and structure and all

604
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,480
that type of stuff

605
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,798
um it's really consistent and

606
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,120
uh it'll probably be another show but it

607
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,119
is blended into some very famous stuff

608
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,599
you know that we won't dive into um

609
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,799
but

610
00:21:51,599 --> 00:22:00,480
uh all i know is uh all i know is um

611
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,759
where it's from yeah that's the totality

612
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
that's how it goes it was from an old

613
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,879
dude on maui they've been growing there

614
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,558
for a long time and he basically said he

615
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,559
grew things and acclimated him there and

616
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,599
he came over to amsterdam to trade seeds

617
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,279
with friends

618
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,158
yeah and he would bring stuff back and

619
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,678
mix it into his lines and

620
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,000
so he said it was an afghan that

621
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,960
finished quick and yielded well and was

622
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,960
rot resistant and you could see the

623
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400
you know you could see the the sativa in

624
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,960
it and so

625
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,200
i have pretty high hopes uh that csi

626
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,919
will blend into a few different things

627
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,279
um because it's such a stable breeder

628
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,759
and the other part about it that i

629
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,319
really like is that when any time you

630
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,038
get anything that's that old

631
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,879
its lineage ties to something completely

632
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,079
different than what's a mishmash of

633
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,159
today

634
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,960
yeah that's true anything from the mid

635
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,960
90s doesn't really have any of the most

636
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,840
famous 40 or 50 cuts that we usually

637
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,360
talk about that's in it

638
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,879
yeah so a lot of times when you're

639
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:58,319
breeding you get the best results when

640
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,280
you start breeding things that are kind

641
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:04,480
of unlike each other and not too related

642
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:07,200
um so it's not related to chem or kush

643
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,679
or this or that or da da da da da da da

644
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
you know and so it hasn't been overused

645
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,480
and over blended

646
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,038
um

647
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,038
you know and so there's uh matt sent me

648
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:21,200
a a thing this morning um about all the

649
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,558
um

650
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,880
i'm sorry i started reading stuff and

651
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,038
got distracted but you know we could one

652
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,559
day do i we have some good friends that

653
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,679
probably uh

654
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,319
would be a a lot better experts on like

655
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,919
hawaiian growing culture and famous

656
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,119
strains and stuff like that i don't

657
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,280
really feel

658
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,599
it's like my place to like lead a kind

659
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,918
of discussion like that it's not an area

660
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,240
where my knowledge goes hella deep

661
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,159
yeah i couldn't talk on molokai frost

662
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,919
like people are asking or quite electric

663
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,440
i couldn't talk on any of that yeah i

664
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,679
mean you know i've heard plenty of

665
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,679
stories secondhand i've had you know i

666
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
know a bunch of growers uh from over

667
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,960
there and stuff like that over the years

668
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,359
um

669
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,880
you know but you know that we could do a

670
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,119
whole episode

671
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,679
uh where people could ask questions

672
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,278
um you know but i we did think it was

673
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,440
worth mentioning we did think it was

674
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,200
cool to talk about because hawaiian is

675
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,519
sort of getting like brought back in

676
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,558
because of this interest in the nl and

677
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,480
the nl5 and what greg was doing and

678
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,079
and you know maybe maybe there's an

679
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,519
aspect of like talking about what

680
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,678
hawaiian was

681
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,639
yeah yeah was beneficial

682
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,600
so

683
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,278
you know hawaiian is is sort of and like

684
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,359
what hawaiian was

685
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,960
isn't what hawaiian is

686
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,519
that's correct yeah because what

687
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,679
hawaiian was back then might have been a

688
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,200
mix of colombian and mexican and some

689
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,880
afghans and stuff that the brotherhood

690
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,640
of eternal love was doing

691
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,400
but hawaii now

692
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,360
is just another place that clones get

693
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,679
sent

694
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,918
right so it's got cherry pie and it's

695
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,038
got skunks and it's got this and it's

696
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,679
got chems and da da da da and you know

697
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,839
so on and so on and whatnot um yeah it

698
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,519
is a cool place in the sense that

699
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,839
there's uh

700
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,200
you know it's super humid there

701
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,519
and um

702
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,759
it's a totally different environment

703
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,918
and so you have to find things that do

704
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,359
well in that environment

705
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,440
yeah you know what i that would be a

706
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,759
good idea maybe we could have pacololo

707
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,278
in paradise on and yeah that's why i

708
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,038
just want to talk about it we have some

709
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,440
resources and some friends that would be

710
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,759
far more educated uh because that's

711
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
their neck of the woods yeah to talk

712
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,278
about that kind of stuff than we would

713
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,640
be i just wanted to bring it up in the

714
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,038
sense that we've been getting a bunch of

715
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,000
questions about hawaiian

716
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:39,038
and hawaiian lights and

717
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,960
what's your maui and stuff like that and

718
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,519
you know maui is one of those ones where

719
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,880
i even lost it uh sadly for a number of

720
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,240
years due to some unfortunate

721
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,278
circumstances

722
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,240
um but because it was a classic grown by

723
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,558
old timers around my area in mendo

724
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,319
um it it lift

725
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,038
yeah because like i said you know there

726
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:02,720
was you know in in an era where like

727
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,640
weed was weed to some degree um

728
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,319
you know a four to six pound reliable

729
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,840
plant that was done in the middle of

730
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,960
october was pretty beneficial

731
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,759
yeah so it was kind of one of those

732
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,640
things i brought i brought it out

733
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,079
in 98 or whatever yeah and started

734
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,000
spreading it around

735
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,158
and it's kind of percolated around our

736
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,798
area off and on since then and it's

737
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,960
still around there yeah uh yeah i mean i

738
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,119
still have it i live here

739
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,880
uh there's a few friends that have it uh

740
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,918
it's certainly probably under pressure

741
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,520
with how few strains sell currently

742
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,759
you know and how rough the market has

743
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,200
become and how how low the market has

744
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,400
become recently

745
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,038
um but it definitely still exists

746
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,400
um i gave it to like i said i gave it to

747
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,519
csi

748
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,519
um

749
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,798
to breed with

750
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,679
you know

751
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,440
and preserve help preserve you know it's

752
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,960
always it's always risky

753
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,320
when you're trying to save things you

754
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,079
have to find people that have an

755
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,798
interest in stuff that were willing to

756
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,319
hold on to it yeah

757
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,599
right because there could be a fire

758
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,839
there could be an accident there could

759
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,199
be a bus there could be any number of

760
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,359
different things

761
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,519
um people are talking about what's aloha

762
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,278
white widow i don't really know much

763
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,440
about aloha

764
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,079
except for amsterdam except for it was

765
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,519
white widow from amsterdam popped on in

766
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:25,199
hawaii

767
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:27,038
aloha seeds was from amsterdam

768
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,319
from amsterdam yeah they were a dutch

769
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,679
company and they they made it

770
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,519
and they just called it aloha white

771
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,519
widow so everybody assumed it was you

772
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,759
know a hawaiian white widow

773
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,519
see there you go i even assumed yeah

774
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,519
yeah i just assumed that it was a it was

775
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,599
another one of those things where

776
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,440
you're in um

777
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,558
you know you're in it's it was just one

778
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,960
of those things where it's like oh it's

779
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,558
from hawaii let's add hawaii i actually

780
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,000
called aloha seed bank in amsterdam

781
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,200
god when i first heard about the

782
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,558
strength because i wanted to see if i

783
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,840
could still source it at the time um

784
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,079
yeah they wouldn't even talk about what

785
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,678
was in it or any of that but yeah it was

786
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,119
it was their their seed line they

787
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
weren't they just weren't interested in

788
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,119
selling it anymore so it's sort of one

789
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,000
of those things where uh soma decided to

790
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,959
call a line new york city diesel exactly

791
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,720
and it's not sour diesel but we'll call

792
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,440
it diesel because it was the first you

793
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,480
know

794
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,880
yeah um

795
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,079
so who knows who knows i was mistaken

796
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,240
right there i didn't actually know it's

797
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,678
back history i've never personally grown

798
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,640
it you know

799
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,759
um

800
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,278
so so

801
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:33,278
i think probably like 99 of people had

802
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,759
no clue that it was aloha seats

803
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,519
amsterdam um it's just it's just how

804
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,440
it's always gone everybody was a

805
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,119
aloha widow of course it would be and

806
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,038
that's that's one of the things that

807
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,918
matt and i always talk about where it's

808
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,240
like you can make misleading statements

809
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,640
and not outright lie

810
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,679
and then people will just assume

811
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
yeah

812
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,038
exactly

813
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,080
these genetics are authentic

814
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,240
by the way i i was super stoked a long

815
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:03,278
time ago i made a joke about how you

816
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,679
could rename blueberry or blue dream and

817
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,919
call it blueberry [ __ ] yum yum and

818
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,480
someone would probably buy it i just

819
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,320
today saw a string called blueberry yum

820
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,519
yum taken off oh man damn hot damn

821
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,720
called it

822
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,798
oh somebody's talking about ncga

823
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,000
rock 10 rock

824
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,519
you know so yeah i mean there's the the

825
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,240
the name game and then creating

826
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,278
assumptions based on that yeah um you

827
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,159
know i mean

828
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,398
20 years ago if something was

829
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,559
was named after some kind of smell or

830
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,158
aroma or whatever it probably had some

831
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,359
kind of distinctive

832
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,679
remembrance of that yeah uh now it's it

833
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,000
has no connection to it

834
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,200
you know is it a ludicrous song i call i

835
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,159
pull blueberry yum yum out my ass but

836
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,519
god damn it's hard being original

837
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,120
i wouldn't have known that it's very

838
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,918
hard being original

839
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,519
so

840
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,799
yeah i mean there's there's aspects

841
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,679
where

842
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,440
you know hawaiian um

843
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,519
uh you know it's probably going to

844
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,080
remain a mystery and when any time

845
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,839
anytime you have like a mystery right

846
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,079
that's hard to be proven

847
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,199
you're going to get people that are

848
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,720
going to claim that they have knowledge

849
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,399
yeah and they have facts behind the

850
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,798
rumor and it's like oh well you might

851
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,398
not have had the hawaiian that went to

852
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,319
greg but we did

853
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,639
yeah that was my uncle

854
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,319
yeah yeah

855
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,240
that was my dad that was my uncle that

856
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,960
was my that was my dad's best friend

857
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,599
that was my you know my aunt's you know

858
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,079
my my aunt's boyfriend whoever you know

859
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:40,319
because you can't really refute it and

860
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,158
that's really popular in cannabis

861
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,798
um is

862
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,600
being able to not refute things well i

863
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,798
mean you saw just just in this episode

864
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,398
just in this

865
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,359
20 minutes or whatever that we've been

866
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:55,119
live you saw one person come in here

867
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,158
ask for an opinion because they weren't

868
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,879
sure and then flip out because it was

869
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,200
counter to what they wanted to hear

870
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,799
i missed that part

871
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,440
i'm not very good at patting my head and

872
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,798
rubbing my stomach so i ignore a lot of

873
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,640
the comments not because they're not

874
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,839
valuable but because i i have a hard

875
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,038
time like

876
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,000
bullshitting

877
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:18,398
uh and reading at the same time yeah you

878
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,398
know my brain

879
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,319
my brain was in here repeatedly asking

880
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,918
about someone non-stop

881
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,720
and then asked about someone that

882
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,799
referred him to that person um someone

883
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,558
from virginia that dude so i was just

884
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,240
like dude stop yeah i mean i don't know

885
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,398
there's and there's aspects too where

886
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,079
it's like sometimes people make a really

887
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,839
good assumption that like this is old

888
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,398
enough and this is mysterious enough

889
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,319
that it'll never be outed oh yeah yeah i

890
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,158
think most of them that do it think that

891
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,558
i think that it's old enough and it's in

892
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,320
the past enough and it's i mean we even

893
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,398
saw when i won't even mention their name

894
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,678
but we did this that we outed somebody a

895
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,079
few years ago

896
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,919
um that consistently had he was a

897
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,079
younger cat and he consistently had

898
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,799
strains that were from one to two years

899
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,558
before they were ever released yeah and

900
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,440
you could just tell that they were just

901
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,960
hunting on the forums for early info

902
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,080
yeah and then they figured they'd they'd

903
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,519
ratchet it back for a week a year or two

904
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,278
and then they didn't realize that there

905
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,798
was people that were actually alive and

906
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:16,558
in cannabis then

907
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,879
yeah you know

908
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,558
um yeah yeah he didn't even that dude

909
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,600
didn't even go look at the catalogs to

910
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,798
see if he could get the you're right

911
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,798
he's just like [ __ ] it

912
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,000
we won't even talk about that but when i

913
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,919
first saw him on instagram i thought

914
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,278
that dude was like in his 50s

915
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,720
he would have had to have been and then

916
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,519
i figured and then i figured out he was

917
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,600
like 27 and i was like what in the [ __ ]

918
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,440
you know no yeah

919
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,038
so you know and yeah there's a thing i

920
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,679
mean there's multiple people that that

921
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,679
have claimed um you know that have

922
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,360
claimed connection to various seed banks

923
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,399
or various people or various this or

924
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,398
that and

925
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,000
you know uh one of the cool things about

926
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,959
the internet is that it's linked a bunch

927
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,599
of us

928
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,798
yeah and so you get a chance to you know

929
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,719
you get a chance to ask those people

930
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,480
and then they're like hell no

931
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,798
yeah

932
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,159
you know and uh

933
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,079
you know and so

934
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,240
you know there's uh yeah it's go hey

935
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:13,918
someone picked it up skunk 18 fam uncle

936
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,720
fester skunk 18. uh nature fraud

937
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,200
i noticed someone mentioned about the uh

938
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,880
seats being federally legal and i at

939
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,038
first i was like what

940
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,799
first that's from a source like a single

941
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,240
source and i'm not 100 sure on what they

942
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:30,000
posted but if if um cannabis seeds were

943
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,519
to be classified as hemp seeds you'd

944
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,759
still need a hemp license you need a

945
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,960
seed distribution license and you'd only

946
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,558
be distributing in your state so no i

947
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,558
think you can send it i think you can

948
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,200
send it out of state but i think the

949
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,879
issue is is that you can't just be like

950
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,798
i'm going to send my buddy in florida a

951
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,760
bunch of seeds and write

952
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,519
hemp and we're good no you have to have

953
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,759
there has to be legitimate companies in

954
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,798
both states

955
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,798
because

956
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,720
hemp is legally registered in the state

957
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,480
of california as a california hemp seed

958
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,720
company yes and you'd have to send it to

959
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,640
a registered i use is that how it works

960
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,600
you'd have to be in the market for them

961
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,240
to see

962
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,960
is hemp was put in the farm bill

963
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,678
yeah so it's um it's legal in all 50

964
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,079
states yes it's not a state it's not a

965
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,079
state by state thing and there's even

966
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,039
there's even hemp transports where you

967
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,560
can transport legal hemp clones from one

968
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,239
state to another

969
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,078
interesting but you

970
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,239
still to this day after working at the

971
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,480
hemp farm i know that they cannot buy

972
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,358
anything not licensed to be sold in

973
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,440
california by a hemp register sure that

974
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,440
might be a different so yes technically

975
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,200
it's legal but there's but

976
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,119
it's still like you have to have two

977
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,918
hemp businesses it has to be a

978
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,679
legitimate sale between hemp businesses

979
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,519
it's not like i'm gonna send a bunch of

980
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,960
hemp seeds legally

981
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,559
we haven't gotten to the point where

982
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,320
it's like tomato seeds or something like

983
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:53,759
that where it's just like enthusiasts

984
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,639
can just trade whatever the [ __ ] they

985
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,640
want yeah i mean i i just ran through

986
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,599
this and experienced it with uh the

987
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:03,519
california hemp laws and like register

988
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,680
trying to register to be a breeder of

989
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,119
hemp and stuff like you have to do go

990
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,799
through so many [ __ ] hoops maybe

991
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,559
that's just california too

992
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,839
but you have to go through so many hoops

993
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,559
to be able to grow

994
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,880
hemp in california for sure yeah i mean

995
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,880
i'm sure i'm sure states state by state

996
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,640
they can put their own regulations on it

997
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,320
yeah but i don't believe that any state

998
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,239
can make hempi legal because it's a

999
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,920
federally federally legal on the farm

1000
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:29,679
bill it's just it's not illegal but it's

1001
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,440
heavily regulated

1002
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,559
and i think what happened is is that all

1003
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,960
these people in all these different

1004
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,320
states jumped into hemp and there wasn't

1005
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,199
a pipeline

1006
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,039
for that much cbd or cbg or

1007
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,799
hemp products yet

1008
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,199
yeah people are saying

1009
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,960
that um like costco doesn't have a

1010
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:48,879
license no but they're selling hemp

1011
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,280
that's been treated with heat that's a

1012
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,640
whole another different kind of license

1013
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,800
everything else once it's been treated

1014
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,319
with heat it's unviable so of course

1015
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,240
they can sell that

1016
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,280
yeah i mean that's that's been around

1017
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,959
forever but yes it has

1018
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,119
so i don't know i mean

1019
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,639
there's uh but yeah there's there's been

1020
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,400
i mean that's one of the one of the

1021
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,480
reoccurring frauds

1022
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,880
in cannabis is just

1023
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,358
like you know since new people are in

1024
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,599
every five or ten years you can recycle

1025
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,239
the same garbage over and over again you

1026
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,838
know

1027
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,679
and then people get all mad and they

1028
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,199
start coming on and defending themselves

1029
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,199
and then the people that told the lie

1030
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,759
first they start to change aspects of it

1031
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,519
because they realize they've been outed

1032
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,960
you know and they have to shift what it

1033
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,519
is you know

1034
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,199
um and it's just one of those it's just

1035
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,759
one of those areas that's like right for

1036
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,719
[ __ ] yeah you know

1037
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,720
um and so maybe maybe i should

1038
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,480
maybe i should do like i never do a plug

1039
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,559
on here but maybe i should do like a

1040
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,480
plug right yeah so

1041
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,279
uh anytime you see

1042
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,119
like

1043
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,880
quote unquote my headband cut or like

1044
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,720
when i just talked about the maui or

1045
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,358
anything like that like

1046
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,759
my entire intention for spreading

1047
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,358
genetics is for people to have good weed

1048
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,560
yeah so

1049
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,358
um

1050
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,599
you know i uh

1051
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,960
i don't um

1052
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,680
i don't

1053
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,079
i'm not making anything off of uh

1054
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,919
off of can't off off these things i'm

1055
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,440
not profiting in any way i'm not trying

1056
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,519
to jump into the seed game i've had a

1057
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,559
bunch of friends trying me to

1058
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,880
trying to get me to uh one of them is on

1059
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,000
is your is on your screen right now

1060
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,440
um but uh i've resisted you know um and

1061
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,119
it's nothing it's nothing against people

1062
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,079
that make seed for money or anything

1063
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,680
like that because obviously i have a

1064
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,119
bunch of friends that do so

1065
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,598
um but

1066
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,039
like part of passing out uh you know

1067
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,000
clones and stuff like that to good

1068
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,320
friends uh and especially csi is that

1069
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,400
he's got enough of a matt and csi and

1070
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,000
others have enough of a customer base

1071
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,358
that you can get good stuff out there

1072
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,760
that's different

1073
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,559
yeah and one of the ways that like you

1074
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,079
know i've said it before but um probably

1075
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,440
the person that probably the person that

1076
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,599
did the biggest

1077
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,480
guarantee that my mendo perps will never

1078
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,559
disappear from the community is caleb

1079
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,519
yeah because he fell in love with it and

1080
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,480
he

1081
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:10,480
grew he crossed it to a [ __ ] ton

1082
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,400
of different things and enough people

1083
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,719
bought that that even if the mom was to

1084
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,800
terribly get lost her children and

1085
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:20,000
grandchildren are freaking everywhere

1086
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,720
yeah and so that's really if you want to

1087
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,719
talk about legacy with seeds um or

1088
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,118
anything else you know anytime anything

1089
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:30,480
gets popular like all of a sudden you

1090
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,559
know caleb releases um some ella some

1091
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,480
chem d and and l.a

1092

1094
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,319
amazing things in it and now for the

1095
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,320
first time ever all of a sudden you

1096
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,760
start to see clone sellers popping up

1097
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,640
with the cut

1098
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,960
you know

1099
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:52,719
um and you start to see

1100
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,679
freaking uh and you start to see

1101
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,159
um

1102
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,719
you know people popping up with with you

1103
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,639
know crosses that have it you know

1104
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,439
and all that different types of [ __ ] and

1105
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,039
so

1106
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,280
you know it's just one of the things

1107
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,279
that goes along with popularity

1108
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,839
yeah you could probably go back six

1109
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,839
months and before or a year before i

1110
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,320
started talking about it and nobody has

1111
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,960
it yeah nobody was ever talking about

1112
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,559
the la kush headband before

1113
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,000
we started talking about it so nobody

1114
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,358
was mentioning it nobody was mentioning

1115
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,280
it i mean not that it hadn't existed

1116
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,679
before and not that it didn't exist with

1117
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,119
mandel brought seeds 15 years ago or

1118
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,319
something like that but in the last five

1119
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,960
or six years it was it was nowhere yeah

1120
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,119
right and so and and now all of a sudden

1121
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,039
and really it only got my name i didn't

1122
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,400
even want it to have my name

1123
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,279
um people were just trying to

1124
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,160
differentiate like how what to call what

1125
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,079
headband yeah and so they attached it to

1126
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,519
it so it's like people always assume

1127
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,480
that i'm getting some royalty or i'm

1128
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,960
getting some kind of um you know aspect

1129
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,199
or i'm getting cuts or you know payback

1130
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,838
or whatever and or they're assuming also

1131
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,679
sometimes that you verified said cut

1132
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:00,960
yeah but i verified it and that's why it

1133
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:02,480
has it and so

1134
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,760
you know there's an aspect to it where

1135
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,480
it's like the only reason why i passed

1136
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,319
it out to a few good friends is just to

1137
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,480
hopefully have people that uh get weed

1138
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,599
that i like a whole bunch

1139
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,079
yeah and get that into some hybrids

1140
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,400
that's really it just so everybody knows

1141
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,560
you know so if you start seeing you know

1142
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,318
people pop up on clone traders and this

1143
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,000
and that and everything else it's not

1144
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:26,559
like i'm the only person on earth that

1145
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,880
has it but it's very very small circle

1146
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,119
and it's most likely a scam

1147
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,119
yeah at this point you know if it

1148
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,440
becomes incredibly popular like

1149
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,519
everything else it'll probably leak

1150
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,679
and there'll be some you know but

1151
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,280
i mean it's really just oh somebody

1152
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,759
somebody's finding a bunch of fire i

1153
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,119
have that yeah you want it it's 400

1154
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,720
bucks

1155
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,079
oh i'm breeding with that i got seeds of

1156
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,159
it already

1157
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,318
i got that yep

1158
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,559
and that's the seed name game you know

1159
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,960
this is name game and that's it's as far

1160
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,480
back as like as people in amsterdam not

1161
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,000
wanting to give out lineage just so

1162
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,519
their competitors would all copy that

1163
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,838
lineage instantaneously yeah

1164
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,000
so you know just for clarification on

1165
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,920
that like it it it's not and there's

1166
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,760
nothing wrong with selling seeds or this

1167
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,240
or that or whatever else but it's like

1168
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,160
my entire breeding has like not been

1169
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,519
that's not been i bred for because i

1170
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,279
like good weed

1171
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,599
yeah

1172
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,359
you know um and i think it makes some

1173
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,280
people mad that they can't attack me for

1174
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,838
[ __ ] them over or like or breeding

1175
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,440
hermes [ __ ] or this or that whatever you

1176
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,599
know and and really when it comes down

1177
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,358
to it too is like you know a bunch of

1178
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,680
our friends have been talking to talking

1179
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:38,159
about it and it's like if this seed

1180
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,598
crash leads to a financial crash for a

1181
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,078
bunch of people

1182
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,318
it might go back to a small handful of

1183
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,240
enthusiasts making seats

1184
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:49,679
and it will be i i really think it will

1185
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,199
be yeah because 95 of the people has you

1186
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,118
know have gotten into seed breeding in

1187
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,559
the last five or six years

1188
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,160
with the intention that it could be

1189
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,440
another revenue stream and it could get

1190
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,879
their name out there and it could get

1191
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,639
this and that and

1192
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,800
part of the reason why so much stuff

1193
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,639
today comes from so few breeders from 20

1194
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,599
years ago is because nobody bothered to

1195
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,159
breed

1196
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,760
yeah it wasn't all that common

1197
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,440
yeah because it was there wasn't money

1198
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,240
in it yeah there wasn't a lot of money

1199
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,838
in it

1200
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,279
people think there's a lot of money in

1201
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:16,799
it now but there's only a few people

1202
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,240
making a lot of money

1203
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,680
yeah there's only a few people and

1204
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,838
there's and you know and so there was a

1205
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,440
minute there in ig where people could

1206
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,119
sell seeds and make their own private

1207
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,800
hybrids and like sell them to their

1208
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,640
followers and all that and that seems to

1209
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,960
be collapsing a little bit right now

1210
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,639
yeah um so we'll see in two or three

1211
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,240
years how many of those people really

1212
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,400
love making seeds and care about

1213
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:37,919
breeding and which ones it was just

1214
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,079
another avenue

1215
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,280
yeah for revenue

1216
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,920
and not that there's anything wrong with

1217
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,160
revenue you know nothing wrong i

1218
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,680
i have seen a massive

1219
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,838
the one thing i mean whether people hate

1220
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,159
me are like me i haven't gone away and

1221
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,639
i've seen a massive overturn since i've

1222
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,118
gotten here and i'm i'm expecting a

1223
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,799
super massive overturn because i mean

1224
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,640
just in the past five years you know

1225
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,318
thousands of people making seats trying

1226
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,239
to sell it has popped up and that's

1227
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,838
going to get a lot harder that's the

1228
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,078
problem too is that since most people

1229
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:11,358
started recently

1230
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,519
you know they're grabbing what they have

1231
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,838
available to them that's recent

1232
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:18,159
so all this breeding is like all the

1233
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,838
same five or six you know five or six

1234
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:20,719
years of the most recent most famous

1235
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,838
stuff

1236
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,598
yeah and i uh i don't think that you're

1237
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,480
going to find anything magically

1238
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,119
different

1239
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,159
crossing cherry pie and kush

1240
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,559
no

1241
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,799
i think that people have tried that

1242
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,400
yeah over and over and over and over and

1243
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,839
over

1244
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,119
and you know and you're probably not

1245
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:40,480
going to find anything new using

1246
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,838
cushmits

1247
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,358
no and i'm not even dissing those

1248
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,519
strains don't get me wrong i'm not i'm

1249
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,639
just saying nothing's unique

1250
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:50,079
to today everybody sneak from it

1251
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,358
you know yeah i mean there was there's a

1252
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,640
guy commenting there was a bunch of

1253
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:54,880
people that had

1254
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,960
the surprising thing about about the

1255
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,720
head my headband cut is not that it's

1256
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,079
mine or whatever because i didn't make

1257
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,959
it or anything but

1258
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,960
that

1259
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,358
most people won't hold on to anything

1260
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,159
unless it's making them money right now

1261
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:07,920
yeah

1262
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:11,199
so there's an enormous amount of stuff

1263
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,599
like uh you know 15 years ago i knew

1264
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,919
dozens and dozens of growers that had

1265
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,599
urkel and grape ape and gdp

1266
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,760
and green crack even yeah and green

1267
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,440
crack and then as soon as the market

1268
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,119
changed

1269
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,639
six people kept it

1270
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,200
yeah there was a bunch of people that

1271
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:29,759
had headband 15 years ago

1272
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:32,000
you know or sours you know yeah i mean i

1273
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,200
even had a friend call me the other day

1274
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,719
uh who's lifelong resident of

1275
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,358
southern humboldt

1276
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:41,039
and they're looking for sour cuts

1277
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,639
yeah because in the last two or three

1278
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,639
years everybody

1279
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,318
has been um

1280
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,159
popping all you know working with all

1281
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,719
this candy and all this dessert and all

1282
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,559
this purple and all this stuff and now

1283
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,639
people are starting to ask for it again

1284
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,000
and nobody kept it

1285
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,559
it's not like it doesn't exist they'll

1286
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,159
be able to get it back again eventually

1287
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,039
but maybe they don't get back the same

1288
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:02,799
one

1289
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,000
yeah that's that's that's a big deal

1290
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,599
that's why a lot of people don't have

1291
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,318
vertical like you said oracle was one of

1292
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,920
the most grown things up there everybody

1293
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,079
that had more than ten lights in mendo

1294
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,920
was growing urkel or grape ape or

1295
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,240
something like that mendopa they were

1296
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,400
all growing purples yeah

1297
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:22,959
you know um and uh you know and then you

1298
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,920
know when sauer and kush came in

1299
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,318
um

1300
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,280
everybody dropped it yep when cookies

1301
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,960
came in a bunch of people dropped sours

1302
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,480
when this came in a bunch of people

1303
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,639
dropped that

1304
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,800
and i do think there's going to be a

1305
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,519
renaissance of some of those strains

1306
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,000
because they're better in my opinion

1307
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,280
than a lot of the modern cuts

1308
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,800
absolutely

1309
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,640
they'll come back they taste better they

1310
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,640
work better they're longer lasting they

1311
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:50,400
have more unique eyes

1312
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,078
you know that type of thing so i think

1313
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,800
they will make a comeback

1314
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,800
um you know uh but

1315
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,720
you know there's i mean

1316
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,440
the my sour that i have i've had this

1317
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,679
sour since the very early 2000s i don't

1318
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,079
know which one it is

1319
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,000
yeah um but it's not most of the one

1320
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,400
i've collected a whole bunch of them

1321
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,318
um and it's not most of them

1322
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,559
yeah i haven't found one i haven't found

1323
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:16,559
one i kept hoping i'm like oh maybe it's

1324
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,358
the choco maybe it's the amish maybe

1325
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:23,199
it's the joe b maybe it's the

1326
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:24,000
uh ecsd maybe it's the nycd maybe it's

1327
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,879
the

1328
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,920
you know

1329
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,240
yeah um

1330
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,639
and it's really hard is you really can't

1331
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,879
tell diesels apart by pictures

1332
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,719
no no no they all tend to look super

1333
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,318
skunky you really have to grow them side

1334
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:37,598
by side and you really have to kind of

1335
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:39,920
smoke them if you want to pick out

1336
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,960
differences yeah

1337
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,480
you know

1338
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:48,159
so um you know what i know about my sour

1339
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,240
is that it's old and that we kept it

1340
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,559
and that's about it you know the

1341
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,118
headband got renamed sour by a bunch of

1342
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,039
people um it got

1343
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,240
and you know it got tossed around but it

1344
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,079
was a little bit more finicky than

1345
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,000
regular sour and it could freak out on

1346
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,440
you sometimes so a lot of people got rid

1347
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,559
of it because it wasn't as easy as the

1348
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,119
other ones

1349
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,559
yeah you know and and then people get

1350
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,160
rid of their cut

1351
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,639
and one thing that i've learned is that

1352
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:14,000
if i would have lost my sour cut even

1353
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,519
though i have six or seven other

1354
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,480
different ones right now

1355
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:18,400
um

1356
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,079
it none of them are that one

1357
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,480
yeah and there's a bunch of people that

1358
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,800
always talk about you know i tried to

1359
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,199
get back that thing that i had

1360
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,318
and i can't find the sour diesel cut or

1361
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:32,639
the blue dream cut or the gdp cut like

1362
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:34,960
or the trinity i can't get it back

1363
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:38,239
it's like this one's good

1364
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,599
but it's not um but it's not it's not

1365
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,078
what it is

1366
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,240
i um dookie made a good comment he said

1367
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,760
the skunk search should start in a sour

1368
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:49,679
s1 and i i agree but i think

1369
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,520
the places i saw it the most were when

1370
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,598
you cross two

1371
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,119
different expressions of super skunk was

1372
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,119
where i was seeing it just constantly

1373
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,720
pop up i thought that was but i think

1374
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,760
that you can probably find that miss our

1375
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,959
s1

1376
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,359
it's just you can't make them the

1377
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,240
problem is with sour s1s is that like it

1378
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,719
fails or you get like 20 seats exactly

1379
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,639
that's why that's why i even went with

1380
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,558
crossing two super skunks that are that

1381
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,558
are different expressions like a sour

1382
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,400
and a diesel but i do agree with them i

1383
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,880
think that

1384
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,960
diesels are modern skunk

1385
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,440
yes i think it's one of the most classic

1386
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,480
examples of a modern skunk oi type plant

1387
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,440
that we have

1388
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,960
yeah

1389
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,480
diesels are modern skunk and the good

1390
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,400
thing about the diesels

1391
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,599
is that unlike a lot of other things

1392
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,039
where you could be like oh that one's

1393
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,400
fake or whatever

1394
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,519
most of the diesels are pretty [ __ ]

1395
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,680
nice man

1396
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,759
yeah they burn good they smoke good they

1397
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:42,000
have you know they range in gassy to

1398
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,920
more headband aromas stuff like that but

1399
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,679
grown well taken long enough dried right

1400
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,599
they they work you know um they work

1401
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,279
they're good you know so it's one of my

1402
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,280
favorite families

1403
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,880
so you know there's probably like at

1404
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,119
this point from my experimentation

1405
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,318
there's at least 10 or 12 cuts that are

1406
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,440
all different from each other that

1407
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:03,759
circulate

1408
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,920
yeah of course everyone wants to be like

1409
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,240
oh mine's the oldest mine's the original

1410
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,920
mine's the one you remember

1411
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:10,639
that's why you should pay x amount for

1412
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,519
it

1413
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,358
yeah in clone form or in weed form

1414
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,599
because it i can try it take take it

1415
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,759
back right to 95. you don't know the

1416
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,880
bros that i know

1417
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,720
most of those people haven't been

1418
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,880
growing since i mean whatever you know i

1419
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:27,919
just i i know in the sense that that

1420
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,920
it's like then it becomes

1421
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:32,159
you know that's really what it becomes

1422
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:34,000
it becomes a marketing gig uh but

1423
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,879
luckily um

1424
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,119
you know

1425
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,480
uh they a lot of them still exist and

1426
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,760
they're most of them are all good

1427
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,838
there's only one or two that i didn't

1428
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,760
like very much yeah i liked i liked

1429
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,838
um uh your growth the amish i never

1430
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,359
tried it before that oh that was that

1431
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:51,599
those couple years that i brought it to

1432
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,358
the party it was fire it was due to all

1433
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,280
the diesels you grew were flavorful they

1434
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,598
all had that mouth coating thing in

1435
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,280
common but they were all super flavorful

1436
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,200
outdoor i never really had much diesel

1437
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,040
outdoor that was good and that year it

1438
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,639
wasn't it wasn't straight outdoor it was

1439
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:05,599
greenhouse so i had a little bit more

1440
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,879
control

1441
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,800
it was sun grown it was sunny downgraded

1442
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,920
i'm an indoor grower so anything that's

1443
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,440
not [ __ ] pure indoor to me is outdoor

1444
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,960
i mean somebody mentioned somebody

1445
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,838
mentioned i'll bring it up somebody

1446
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,159
mentioned pips ecsd yeah um you know pip

1447
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,480
gave me his ecsd to try

1448
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,879
uh as one of my like which one of these

1449
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,719
sours is my sour and it wasn't my sour

1450
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,880
it's one that i liked a whole bunch and

1451
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:32,719
when he came out to the party that year

1452
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,240
um he was like dude i've only grown it

1453
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:35,519
this good once or twice

1454
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,118
yeah

1455
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,639
you know and i mean some of that's

1456
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,760
probably i did a nice job on the growing

1457
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,799
it but uh you know sun's real nice light

1458
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,960
yeah dude

1459
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,599
i love the sun the sun is a great light

1460
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,838
so if you get good weather with the sun

1461
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,680
and you get warm nice days that go into

1462
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,358
late october early november and you can

1463
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,039
take that sour late

1464
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,838
most people with sour the problem that

1465
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:00,000
became was sour up here is that

1466
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,039
as soon as it got the nose people would

1467
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,400
cut it

1468
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,400
yeah

1469
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,838
and it probably needed another 10 days

1470
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,599
to two weeks

1471
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,519
and it's real easy for it to go from

1472
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,760
being a good nose when you cut it to

1473
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,800
turning complete boof once you try to

1474
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,960
[ __ ]

1475
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,039
cure it i've seen sour go bad so many

1476
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,760
times just in the cure people are asking

1477
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,519
what ajs is you know i i don't i mean i

1478
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,640
know aj a little bit but

1479
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,440

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,039
most of these cuts of diesel cuts are

1508
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:21,199
real nice

1509
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,880
yeah most of them get you nice and high

1510
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,239
most of them burn well

1511
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,160
um

1512
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,719

1514
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,239
right

1515
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,639
[ __ ] i mean he's passed now but

1516
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:36,799
mandelbrot made that up

1517
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,719
yeah that was my sour diesel that i gave

1518
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,160
to him that he crossed into a bunch of

1519
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,159
stuff and he just decided that it was

1520
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:43,679
from amherst and added amherst to it

1521
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,598
because that's what he thought

1522
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:46,399
i didn't get it from amherst

1523
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,119
you know

1524
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,639
so

1525
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,160
but it gets sticks yeah albany real the

1526
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,519
real sour

1527
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,118
that's not a that's not a leading

1528
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:56,880
statement right do you have to try to

1529
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,280
convince people the origins which one is

1530
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,240
it oh the real one the real one original

1531
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,480
one

1532
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:04,078
yeah the original original the real

1533
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,440
original real

1534
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,760

yeah and some of them you know it seems

1538
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,960
like the choco cut is the same thing as

1539
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,960
the ecsd yeah but these names are so

1540
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,240
it's kind of like kush the names get so

1541
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,800
interchangeable

1542
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,959
that one piece one person's diablo og

1543
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,559
could be another person's sfe

1544
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,519

1545
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,040

from this dude so it's his who is it oh

1562
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,760
it's this well you know amish got named

1563
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,358
it because it came out of pennsylvania

1564
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,200
and there's a bunch of amish

1565
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,039
and that one was from shroomie and it's

1566
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:13,598
also called shroomies diesel too so

1567
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,440
called shroomies diesel yeah you know

1568
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,800
um and so there's you know there's

1569
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,720
there's a lot of stuff like that where

1570
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,960
nicknames get added and subtracted i

1571
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,799
don't know what the real deal sour is

1572
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,800
i don't know what the albany sour is but

1573
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,200
it's like as as more of the story comes

1574
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,000
out i would assume that like albany is

1575
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,358
just

1576
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,440
trying to tie it to manny and

1577
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,358
some of the original sour people

1578
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,000
yeah and you know what's funny is like

1579
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:40,159
we know the term from bondo that they

1580
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,400
called the sour that they all prefer the

1581
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,879
manny and we don't really mention that

1582
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,318
much but i guarantee

1583
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,480
that someone's gonna pop up with that

1584

00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,519
some kind of language

1599
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,000
to chat about it it's matt riot's

12-inch [ __ ] i get that all the time i

1601
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,280
just just because i

1602
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,358
was yeah that's just the difference

1603
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,040
between our our measurements and metro

1604
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,558

attached skunky's name to it

1618
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,319

simulator had something to do with since

1632
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,480
any later had nothing to do with the

1633
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:33,118
creation of diesel but he did make some

1634
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,639
nice diesel hybrids later on i do agree

1635
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,680
with that he did a cool strawberry

1636
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,159
diesel

1637
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:41,919
yeah lumpa headband lumpa headband is

1638
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:43,679
most likely a og kush s1 bag seed and in

1639
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,680
that case luffa did name that

1640
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,519

00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,440
himself that was intentional but

1643
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,440
sometimes it's not intentional skunk va

1644
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,000

on whether or not you want to have a an

1658
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,519
ego attachment to it yeah you know but

1659
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:29,440
really when it comes down to it when you

1660
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,599
get back to breeding all the stupid

1661
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,440
names all the attachments all the all

1662
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,359
that everything else the only thing that

1663
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,400
people are gonna remember is if it's

1664
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:37,679
good weed

1665
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,920
yeah

1666
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,719
so you are my phone my phone's getting

1667
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,240
down to like 10 so let's cover some of

1668
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,159
that real quick

1669
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:47,759
all right so there's this thing going

1670
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:51,519
around right now that really irritates

1671
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,960
the piss out of me and um there's uh

1672
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:55,199
you know they've been pushing all this

1673
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,838
stuff with the emerald cup judging

1674
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,000
and all that and sc labs has come out

1675
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,759
with this new classification

1676
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,358
and they're trying to get rid of using

1677
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,599
sativa and

1678
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:08,558
indica which that's a different

1679
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:10,640
discussion yeah i agree i agree

1680
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,000
that we that there could be better terms

1681
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,279
there could be better terminology

1682
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,639
applied to that what they want to

1683
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,640
replace it to

1684
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:19,118
um is they and what they're using for

1685
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:21,279
the emerald cup this year is the most

1686
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,640
ridiculous [ __ ] i've ever seen yeah

1687
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,960
and the reason why is because they have

1688
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,159
six categories and i'll try to do them

1689
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,599
off of memory

1690
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:28,399
um but

1691
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,880
it's

1692
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,000
haze jack and hayes

1693
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,720
yeah

1694
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,400
and it's um this probably won't be an

1695
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,000
order

1696
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,240
og and gas

1697
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,039
yep sweet dreams

1698
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:44,558
sweets and dreams sweet and dreams

1699
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,400
desserts

1700
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,798
exotics

1701
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,760
uh what's the final one tropical and

1702
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:54,480
floral tropical and floral right which

1703
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,200
are two different and so like that's the

1704
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,880
most ridiculous smell and terpene

1705
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,838
classifications i've ever heard in my

1706
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,960
life exotics what is exactly what's

1707
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,119
exotic

1708
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,039
i mean do they go off the exotic mic

1709
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,358
definition of exotics where runts isn't

1710
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:11,279
exotic well i mean just exotic is like

1711
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,159
exotic is something that's unusual to

1712
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,720
you

1713
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,519
yeah exactly that's all exotics i'd be

1714
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:20,159
like like you know maybe some southeast

1715
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,318
asians i would consider exotics or some

1716
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,798
wild africans but if you live there it's

1717
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,079
not exotic it's common exactly so how

1718
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:28,639
cool this might be

1719
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,318
over there what is sweets and dreams

1720
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,480
sweets and dreams is the one that makes

1721
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:34,000
them like no sense to me

1722
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,240
and then you know like and then there's

1723
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
an aspect of okay so you've got sweets

1724
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,439
plus dreams

1725
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,639
and then you've got

1726
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,200
desserts

1727
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:45,358
now i guess cookies has a marketing

1728
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,519
campaign where everything they name is

1729
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:49,440
dessert based yeah so they get their

1730
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,358
whole so they have all these and they

1731
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,519
have sherbet and they have flan and they

1732
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,519
have [ __ ] this and that [ __ ] and

1733
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:57,199
whatever

1734
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,239
none of it tastes like the specific

1735
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,399
dessert

1736
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:03,279
exactly it's just they have a theme

1737
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,200
yeah right uh i will say that cookies

1738
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,200
the original thin mint uh which they

1739
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,519
can't say anymore because uh girl scouts

1740
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:12,558
sued them um but

1741
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:14,480
it did have kind of a doughy flavor

1742
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:17,359
yeah i don't get that from any of it all

1743
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,440
i taste is og but i know people do do

1744
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,119
get that from it so it's it's also like

1745
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,639
how you smell how you taste yeah

1746
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,480
different things i mean i can at least

1747
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:26,239
okay it's got some kind of doughy type

1748
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,880
aroma to it you know that some people

1749
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,959
but what is exotics but it was neither

1750
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,838
thin nor mint that's right

1751
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,559
what is what is exotics what is

1752
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,639
what is dessert weed what is dreams what

1753
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,280
is dreams what does that even [ __ ]

1754
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:44,400
like blue dream even jack and hayes okay

1755
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,359
so jack and hayes in california

1756
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,318
like

1757
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:49,199
um

1758
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:52,960
you know that it's mostly terpenoline

1759
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:55,279
yeah but that's by no means the only

1760
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,559
haze aromas in haze

1761
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,640
in fact

1762
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,798
i would put blue dream in the jackson

1763
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:03,199
haze category more than i would like a

1764
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:05,119
blueberry category but i certainly

1765
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:07,439
wouldn't make a category for dreams

1766
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:10,000
based off one strain but you know it's

1767
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,880
like even if so even like all in back in

1768
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,400
new york right uh where there's a bunch

1769
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,160
of haze cuts that are still pretty

1770
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,318
famous and kept

1771
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,679
yeah you know they don't the the best

1772
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:21,199
ones they have back there aren't

1773
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:23,440
terpitally and they don't smell like

1774
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,759
jack they smell like frankincense they

1775
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,358
smell like church they smell there's a

1776
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,319
variety of smells

1777
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:29,920
so

1778
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,960
hold on i'm going to respond to one

1779
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,159
thing

1780
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:37,199
someone said they are leaning into

1781
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:39,440
genetics no they're not and chemovar

1782
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:40,798
this is not based on chemovar which i

1783
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,079
think is important and i appreciate the

1784
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:43,838
effort and advancing discussion the

1785
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,318
thing is this discussion was already

1786
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:48,558
advanced past indica in sativa and

1787
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:50,639
hybrid long ago

1788
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,400
and it's it's only the people that

1789
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:55,358
aren't very well read on the subject

1790
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,358
that are still there

1791
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,319
just so everyone knows that when you're

1792
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,240
judging at the emerald cup all these

1793
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:04,400
jars are labeled and no one has any

1794
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,199
supposedly has any idea what they are

1795
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,680
yeah

1796
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:10,159
they're supposed to just just blind

1797
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:13,519
smoke and gas and smell and and look and

1798
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:16,239
share it doesn't come with oh this is

1799
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:20,239

01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,078
you smoke this yeah is this dream that

1805
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:32,960
that still blows my mind because i you

1806
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:36,079
know even the even the even the og even

1807
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,838
the og and gas it's like with nog

1808
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,359
there's piney

1809
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,159
there's earthy

1810
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,000
there's so much depth in og itself and

1811
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:46,239
you can't just combine

1812
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,239
diesel and kush

1813
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:52,078
into the same category as gas eogs what

1814
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:54,239
yeah what about what about the the like

1815
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:57,200
the irene ones that are more sweet

1816
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:57,199
cereal oh geez

1817
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,440
ones that are like lemony and pine soul

1818
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,559
yeah and ones that are straight earthy

1819
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,119
mouth coat

1820
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:07,680
yeah um so really to me i'm not trying

1821
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:10,000
to to diss them or whatever but it it

1822
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,838
really is a step backwards and i really

1823
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,440
don't want that kind of language to

1824
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:16,239
start being used

1825
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,358
um because you know what the [ __ ] is

1826
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:19,118
dreams

1827
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:22,400
yeah what the [ __ ] is a dream yeah the

1828
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:24,480
thing my point was like i i agree in

1829
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,559
advancing the conversation because i do

1830
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,119
not think index indica and sativa and

1831
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,559
hybrid are accurate however

1832
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,200
someone already did that but like

1833
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,119
someone pointed out merlin and and clark

1834
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,038
came up with the broadleaf dominant

1835
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:40,079
narrow leaf drug i'm sorry broadleaf

1836
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,920
drug type narrow leaf drug type and um

1837
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,839
from there i mean you you know you can

1838
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,200
classify it any other way but those eld

1839
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,679
and nld

1840
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:49,199
yeah bld and nld is a great way to do it

1841
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,679
because it doesn't talk about the high

1842
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:53,679
type it just talks about this the

1843
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,838
outward expression and maybe we should

1844
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:58,480
you know we're planning on having uh our

1845
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,679
buddy crybaby come on uh one of these

1846
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,119
shows and we're gonna have like a

1847
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:05,199
terpene and an aroma episode uh because

1848
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,358
he can probably talk more intelligently

1849
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:09,199
about those kind of things than we can

1850
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:10,960
he's got a better language

1851
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:13,038
but really what this is it's about

1852
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,519
communication and language so

1853
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,280
when we're talking about our eyes

1854
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:20,000
it's really easy to be like this is

1855
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,559
periwinkle or this is burgundy or this

1856
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,719
is orange or this is and you can be like

1857
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,760
yes that is we can both see it but when

1858
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:29,838
it comes to to nose right

1859
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,359
other than sour

1860
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:32,798
bitter

1861
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:35,199
dead

1862
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:37,280
salty there's only like five or six

1863
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:38,879
things that you actually taste

1864
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,720
right yeah and then the rest is

1865
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,960
impressions so people will be like oh

1866
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:44,159
this smells like pencil shavings or a

1867
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,000
fresh car

1868
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:47,679
or it smells like you know something

1869
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
common like oranges so you don't really

1870
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,919
describe the smell

1871
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,159
you describe something else that it

1872
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,400
smells like

1873
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:58,798
yeah but but that classification what

1874
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,079
the [ __ ] does dream smell like

1875
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:01,679
yeah that's

1876
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,559
what is what is exactly what it smell

1877
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,159
like

1878
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,480
yeah you know what used to be exotic in

1879
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,399
europe pepper

1880
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,440
yeah that's true huh yeah

1881
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,000
spices

1882
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,639
from the far east they were exotic

1883
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,480
you know you can have exhaus exotic

1884
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:18,719
dragon fruit but if you live in hawaii

1885
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,798
it's probably not exotic

1886
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,838
at one point you know mangoes were

1887
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:23,838
probably exotic

1888
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,679
what is oh yeah yeah

1889
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,000
have you had those before

1890
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:33,038
i know i remember yeah fresh vinyl

1891
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,639
linoleum you know new car smell

1892
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,079
all that and so there's a whole bunch of

1893
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,920
those things where it's like it's really

1894
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,000
difficult to have the language to talk

1895
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,039
about smells with people

1896
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,719
and i'm bad at it and you know and i

1897
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,480
always i always when trimmers and stuff

1898
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:48,000
like that i always try to ask them away

1899
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,280
from the rest of the trimmers what do

1900
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,039
you smell when you smell this wheat yeah

1901
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,960
and try to get a bunch of different

1902
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,760
people's feedback and then do i see

1903
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,159
things that people keep talking about

1904
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,400
is there a commonality that you can pull

1905
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,598
out of their impressions

1906
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,440
because not everybody has the same

1907
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:08,240
impression like for instance how would

1908
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,760
europeans know roadkill

1909
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,639
yeah right there is no roadkill in

1910
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,799
europe

1911
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:13,920
no no roadkill skunk no roadkill skunk

1912
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:15,280
but that's what they mean when they talk

1913
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,960
about roadkill yeah

1914
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,559
roadkill skunk i should have been more

1915
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,920
specific but it's like you're not

1916
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,440
american there is no you've never

1917
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,639
smelled a dead skunk on the side of the

1918
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,480
road yeah unless you came here yeah um

1919
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,239
so you know there's an aspect where it's

1920
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,920
like i looked at all this stuff and

1921
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,159
you've got all these judges this

1922
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,798
[ __ ] don't understand the

1923
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:38,639
concepts of monoterpenes try terpenes

1924
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:40,079
sesquiterpene shut the [ __ ] up we don't

1925
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,639
you obviously don't understand the

1926
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,640
discussion

1927
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,880
you can talk about terpenes and you can

1928
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,119
talk about individual terpenes but like

1929
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,280
the language around how those terpenes

1930
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,358
blend into different aromas

1931
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,920
yeah you know like just like there's

1932
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:57,838
there's only so many primary colors

1933
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,039
yeah and you know the terpenes you can

1934
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,038
combine two different things and have

1935
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,640
them smell the exact same way no matter

1936
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,640
what terpenes you're using you know like

1937
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:06,159
you there's certain ways to make

1938
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:07,519
strawberry smells and there's other ways

1939
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:09,598
to make strawberry smells that are very

1940
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,838
similar that two people could smell as

1941
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:14,480
strawberry but the problem is

1942
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,400
it's not a terpene conversation in that

1943
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,559
sense the level of the level of

1944
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,880
education amongst people to discuss

1945
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:23,680
aromas in cannabis is very limited even

1946
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,519
amongst the educated yeah it's a limited

1947
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:27,598
conversation and so i don't think it's

1948
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,599
advanced by and they're all pushing oh

1949
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,200
my god we're breaking barriers and

1950
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,359
here's how we're judging stuff and we've

1951
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,759
got different colored stickers to put on

1952
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:38,639
jars whether it's dessert or whether

1953
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,119
it's haze or whether it's exotic

1954
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,719
yeah and i just think that's a joke

1955
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,960
yeah i think the categories are not

1956
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,759
related to reality

1957
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,000
yeah

1958
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,119
you know and it's not dissing them

1959
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,798
you know no

1960
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,358
it's not dissing them i mean if anything

1961
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:55,199
it's probably dissing sc labs maybe

1962
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:57,519
but it's just uh it's just another way

1963
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:59,838
to try to talk about language and talk

1964
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:00,639
about classifications

1965
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:04,159
um

1966
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:06,239
