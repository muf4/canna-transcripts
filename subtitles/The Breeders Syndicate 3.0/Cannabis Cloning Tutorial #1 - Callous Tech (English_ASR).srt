1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,720
all right so when we're um starting to

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,480
grow one of the things that comes up

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:11,599
pretty quickly is propagation um or just

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,280
getting some clones basically of um

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,399
plants that you're into

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,358
um I'm going to show you guys the way

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,038
that I like to clone today um I'm not

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
saying this is the end all be all there

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,920
are other methods but this is how I like

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,039
to do it um it's been pretty uh cost

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,920
effective time effective just really

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,200
laidback and easy for me um so that's

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,480
you know I'm just going to show you guys

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,160
that and hopefully it helps you guys

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:41,479
today um so without further Ado um first

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,679
thing I like to do is just set up my

17
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,479
space so I like to have a clean work

18
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,399
space I like to have all my stuff out so

19
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,878
that once I get started I don't have to

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,359
stop you know so when I'm thinking about

21
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:53,878
that I'm thinking about I've got a pair

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,119
of gloves here off camera that I'm going

23
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,839
to put on um something quickly that

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,599
you'll see is that cleanliness is the

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,239
name of the game as far as this goes for

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,960
me

27
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,399
um uh I think like if you start with a

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,079
healthy plant and you do clean cuts

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,719
you'll set yourself up for Success um

30
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:17,239
I've messed around a lot with this and

31
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,400
um had tons of failures and that kind of

32
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:23,438
thing and I think overall the biggest

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,478
thing uh that I took away was um keep it

34
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:30,000
simple keep the environment nice and um

35
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,519
you can you can make this happen so I

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,200
got my gloves on

37
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,759
here um the next thing I do is I have

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,560
these um disposable

39
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,560
scalpel um this is pretty helpful to

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,519
have um it just keeps it really clean

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,079
and easy and just no mess so just going

42
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:54,199
to open that up here and we are going to

43
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,199
get us a fresh scalpel blade

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,560
on just like so and we're going to set

45
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,118
this off to the side you can see I also

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,200
have some some clean scissors here I

47
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,959
don't like my scissors to be doing any

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
cutting on the stem or anything like

49
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,118
that um I'll show you what those are for

50
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,439
in a little while but yeah just some

51
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:16,479
clean scissors to have ready um and then

52
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,479
um for my clone gel I'm I've been using

53
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,719
this dip and grow um obviously there's a

54
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:25,598
thousand products on the market for that

55
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,878
and um yeah I'm not a I'm not a uh

56
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,518
sponsored by any of them they all have

57
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:34,079
seemed like they work and that kind of

58
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,200
thing so um you know just I I think it

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,360
is important to use one just to give

60
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,439
yourself a leg up um it's something

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,080
that's there and available you can clone

62
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,840
without it obviously um but it's you

63
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,760
know everything to give yourself a leg

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,400
up is is great in my book um so I have

65
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,679
all that stuff ready I have a plant

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,280
there um and then just over here to the

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,360
side I have some rockwool cubes uh

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,080
that's a little um they're just been

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,720
soaking in a bucket and so so what I

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
like to do with that uh my thought

71
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,479
process behind that is that um when you

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,439
buy Rockwell cubes if you read the

73
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,840
packaging um they're they like they say

74
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,479
that they need to be kind of buffered as

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,239
far as pH goes so what I like to do is

76
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,479
mix up my nutrients um at just a really

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,560
light strength

78
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,719
um

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,519
and then I like to just pH my water to

80
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:30,560
about like 5.8 5.9 and I like to just

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,879
let it soak in there um and I let the

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,280
cubes sit in there at a minimum 30

83
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,239
minutes um but I have like a little

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
bubbler that I run through the day and

85
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,480
just kind of let them sit there and

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,040
helps you know get off gas some of the

87
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,000
chlorine and the water and that kind of

88
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,438
thing as well um so I've got my I've

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,079
just got a a a weak nutrient solution

90
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:55,438
mixed up over there with the cubes in it

91
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:59,519
um you want to take these cuts off of

92
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,878
healthy plants obviously um the plants

93
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,879
have have been watered this morning um

94
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:05,598
and they're they're looking good looking

95
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,679
nice and full and ready to take some

96
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,798
Cuts so uh now that I have everything

97
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,760
ready um something that I like to do for

98
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,438
this technique I like to do the um

99
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,199
callus technique and I I'll show you

100
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:21,759
what that is but I like to take my rock

101
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,879
W Cube it um it comes with like this

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
little hole in it but it doesn't have

103
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,360
any hole on the bottom and also if you

104
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,399
can see on these trays there's an X down

105
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,199
there

106
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,159
um and if you have the Clone sticking

107
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,520
directly out of the bottom of the cube

108
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,759
it will it will um be hitting on that X

109
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,079
so what I like to do is I just have this

110
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:47,240
little metal skewer and I um take it go

111
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,680
into the hole and I go at just like a

112
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,199
little bit of an angle uh you can see

113
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,639
that maybe like a 40 maybe not even a

114
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:59,120
45Â° angle and I just Pierce down through

115
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,360
and I come out the bottom right um and I

116
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
I like to do this so that you're

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,560
creating a channel for the Clone to go

118
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,520
into um and you're not having to like

119
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,439
push the tissue through the rock wall

120
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:13,198
Cube um and causing tissue damage to the

121
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,800
plant um so I have that setting there

122
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,520
have a little label set there I I like

123
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,520
to mention that just because it is

124
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,719
important um it's easy to get these

125
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,079
things mixed up when you're doing a

126
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,440
bunch of cuts so just take your time and

127
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,478
make sure you label them and that kind

128
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:32,199
of thing if you know if that's your Vibe

129
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,639
um all right so we have this plant and

130
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:39,080
what what I like to do is um I'm I'm

131
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,120
shooting to get like a maybe a four to 6

132
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,279
inch cutting off of this plant is what I

133
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,240
like um these are some small clones

134
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,638
obviously that are in Solo cups and I'm

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,038
just trying to um just have them back up

136
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,439
so that I can go ahead and flower these

137
00:05:52,038 --> 00:06:01,199
so what I'm going to do is I like to um

138
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:04,240
come down to say a node like this right

139
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,038
here um so that gives us like a nice you

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,240
know four or five inch cutting um so I'm

141
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,759
gonna try to be as steady as I can and

142
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,639
I'm going to come down

143
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,199
here um you see that and I want to try

144
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,160
to give myself as much space below that

145
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,199
node as I can um and I and I'll show you

146
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,360
why here in just a second um I hope that

147
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,160
that's a good clean angle I'm going to

148
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,400
actually do this off frame so that I can

149
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,400
get a good clean cut

150
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:38,319
um so yeah I am just going down into

151
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,319
that little Groove and we're cutting off

152
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,800
and now uh you can see from

153
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,759
here plant is gone there's there you

154
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,079
know there's now it's been topped

155
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:53,199
essentially now you have this apal

156
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:55,000
cutting um and I'm going to remove these

157
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:01,520
nodes

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,279
here um I apologize let me get up in

159
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,478
here and boop I'm just going to remove

160
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:13,079
these nodes

161
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:17,159
um just like so going to take all these

162
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,159
off got my scalpel upside

163
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:27,199
down and now I have this like one two

164
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,439
and a top so I've got two nodes like

165
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,720
that so I like to stop there that's um

166
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,719
that's pretty much how I like my cuts to

167
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,039
look so then I'm going to take this and

168
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,639
it's going to go into the dip and grow

169
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,959
for just a few seconds come right out

170
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,120
and then we're going to go straight into

171
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,120
this Cube

172
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,840
um and then what I like to do is it's

173
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,000
going to push out the bottom like so I'm

174
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,038
just going to clean that little bit of

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,519
rock wool off of there and you can see

176
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,158
I've got this cut like so and then uh so

177
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,719
I just leave a little bit of the tip

178
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:07,038
sticking out and then um here's where i'

179
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,280
come in with the scissors so I know that

180
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,158
a lot of people um do this for various

181
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,758
reasons to help water loss and that kind

182
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,719
of thing I like to just take the tips of

183
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,038
the leaves off really just as a growth

184
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,199
indicator

185
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:27,878
um because uh yeah I will I'll show you

186
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,879
how I do these I'm clip these

187
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:34,439
off and then I have these leaves in here

188
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,240
I like to personally take the tips off

189
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,880
of these right here um and the only

190
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,959
reason I like to do that is so that like

191
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:45,799
I said a growth indicator when um the

192
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,239
Clone starts to grow and that kind of

193
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,559
thing you can some it's sometimes hard

194
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,519
to tell if it's like New Growth so I

195
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,719
just you know kind of take them off like

196
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,080
that it also does help with um water

197
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,519
loss through transpiration so that's

198
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,000
something you know it's um something

199
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,959
that I like to do I certainly um have

200
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,559
heard arguments that it can you know you

201
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,000
could introduce an infection in doing

202
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,759
that that kind of thing so that's not a

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,039
necessary step if you're not interested

204
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:18,360
in it that's perfectly fine um

205
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,958
so now we have this cut just like so and

206
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,959
I like to just label

207
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:26,838
Ito like that and then that is going to

208
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:29,639
we're going to sit that down in our tray

209
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:33,519
um I'm going to continue to take a few

210
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,679
more Cuts but um I would then just put

211
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,839
the humidity Dome

212
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:44,078
on um this tray and have it closed up I

213
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:47,279
close the vents up and um I go over into

214
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:50,439
my little clone tent um where I have it

215
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:54,278
have the whole tray sitting on top of a

216
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,839
um heat mat um and I like to have the

217
00:09:54,278 --> 00:10:00,159
heat mat set somewhere around

218
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,560
80Â° um maybe 78

219
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,078
um and then I'll I'll have the humidity

220
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,119
Dome on it and I'll keep the humidity

221
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:09,599
Dome um vents closed for the first week

222
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,560
entirely um and then after a week I'll

223
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,839
start to um take a look at them and see

224
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,838
what the roots are looking like um I

225
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,200
really don't like to look at the Clones

226
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,120
at all uh for the first week I don't

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,079
want to touch them I don't want to mess

228
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,440
with the little microclimate that the

229
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:29,278
humidity Dome creates I just want them

230
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,959
to focus on making roots and then um

231
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,600
then I'll you know tend to take a look

232
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,399
at

233
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,440
them um once they are nice and rooted

234
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:42,799
I'll go ahead and open up the um vents

235
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,519
on the humidity Dome and kind of let

236
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,078
make sure that the rock wall cubes dry

237
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,959
out nice um obviously it's a small cube

238
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:54,278
so you need to keep an eye on that

239
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,278
um and then once they're ready uh you

240
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,519
know once they're ready to be watered

241
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,480
again you can you know you can go ahead

242
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,240
and transplant into your medium and

243
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,879
water them in

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,360
or sometimes I like to will just keep

245
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,278
them in the cubes for like another week

246
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,399
um and I'll just dip them completely in

247
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,600
the nutrient solution put them back in

248
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,720
the tray and that way I get like a nice

249
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
uh formed root mass um before I

250
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,519
transplant into soil um but then once I

251
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,639
transplant I like to leave them um in

252
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,839
their new containers in the Clone tent

253
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,560
environment for the first week and then

254
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,480
I just uh TR um transition them out into

255
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,199
my veg

256
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,600
T um yeah hopefully that answers a bunch

257
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,360
of questions that kind of thing um if

258
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,240
you have any kind of questions as far as

259
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,120
taking Cuts goes um please feel free to
