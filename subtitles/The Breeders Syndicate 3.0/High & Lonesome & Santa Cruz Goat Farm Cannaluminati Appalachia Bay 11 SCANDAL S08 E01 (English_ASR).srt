2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,839
we explore the history of a clandestine

00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,059
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,859
cannabis strain history old smuggling

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,019
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,519
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,379
subculture

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,939

interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,079
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,339
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,159
just weren't there

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,300

of the party too like what we saw at the

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,659

36
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,979
Etc

00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:29,219
they do elusive

39
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,478
you know handy avatars

40
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,459
yep

41
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,840
all right so let's start off hi and

42
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,279
Alexa let's talk about some of your new

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,740
lines that you have coming out we have

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,000
of course have your uh Appalachia which

45
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,259
is pretty well known for for many

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,040
reasons can you talk about it a little

47
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,879
bit

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,219
yeah uh so that's a F3 I did I uh went

49
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:51,478
back and I had actually worked the line

50
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,379
to F5 and I wasn't really happy with

51
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,719
um

52
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,859
with what I had selected so I went back

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,739
to the f2s I popped 50 of them I um

54
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:03,539
selected two males and three females and

55
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:07,259
uh kind of let them go at it I wanted

56
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,959
more of the green crack side coming

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,500
through on the Turfs

58
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,360
you know one thing you hear a lot about

59
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,580
Appalachia is about like the creamy

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,860
milky stuff coming through in crosses

61
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,660
yeah

62
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,780
I kind of I'm I'm more a fan of the

63
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:27,239
tropical side of the of the Green Crack

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,580
same

65
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,000
um that creaminess kind of came through

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,180
the trace dog mail that I used

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
all of those that are popped

68
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,459
um they were very potent like the uh on

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,878
the females but they didn't have

70
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,280
the rankness that you would expect with

71
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,378
a Kim D yeah

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,000
how did that cross to the Appalachia

73
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,098
like did it none of the rankness really

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,300
crossed over in the in the outcrosses

75
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,378
did you see it in different Generations

76
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,840
any of it um that's not not a ton no it

77
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,679
was more of like a sweet cream

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,319
um

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,040
you know you see it in Star dogs

80
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:11,280
um in uh Kim four too it's kind of like

81
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,818
a bit sweeter not as nasty not as like

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,060
disgusting garbage as can be yeah

83
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:20,579
um but yeah so so that that's kind of

84
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,098
what I did I wanted to go back to the F3

85
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,200
kind of narrow it down instead of

86
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,378
keeping it wide open narrow it down to

87
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,939
what I wanted out of it what I liked and

88
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,318
um what did you like about the green

89
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,878
crack that made you want to choose that

90
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,199
as a mom or was it just like one of the

91
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,818
moms that you happen to have in the room

92
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,679
when you were doing the run like what

93
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,018
was specifically going on in your mind

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,900
well originally when I did it

95
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,340
um I was doing quite a bit of outdoor uh

96
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,700
on the East Coast uh or probably middle

97
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:54,120
2000s and uh Green Crack performed

98
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,158
extremely well outside it was um yeah

99
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,140
except it needed needed some staking

100
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,359
which you know when your Gorilla growing

101
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,818
you can't do you can't throw it you

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,920
can't you know it's it's a pain in the

103
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,780
ass so I wanted to put

104
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,598
um I wanted to put it on a little bit

105
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,060
more robust frame

106
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,539
um I'd had Kim D for a little bit at

107
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,918
that point and uh you know I was smoking

108
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,620
it a lot and that's what I wanted to

109
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,680
smoke yeah um but the plants were also

110
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:26,519
extremely robust so I crossed it to

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,120
Green Crack uh purple Urkel kimple or MD

112
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:34,620
the uh an Acapulco Gold cut that I had

113
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,918
at the time and uh abusive uh OG Kush oh

114
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,379
no [ __ ] yeah

115
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,418
gold cross dude

116
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:44,639
I never grew that when I gave them all

117
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:48,299
out to friends and I never really heard

118
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,199
anything back about that the uh the only

119
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,660
two that have any kind of lasting value

120
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,080
are the of course the Green Crack cross

121
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,460
and the purple Oracle cross yeah and you

122
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,599
said there was a chem 4 tray dog too

123
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,459
right yes yeah yep I did that as well

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,680
and you know

125
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,500
um what I found in it was very similar

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,019
to stardog there was some really nice

127
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,199
chem type plants in there and you know

128
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,939
some stuff that wasn't wasn't as ranked

129
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,740
you know some some of that creamy

130
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,959
sweetness coming through but still you

131
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,400
know extremely good quality smoking

132
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,560
plants

133
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,459
do you think you got what you wanted out

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,939
initially out of the the trace dog

135
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:35,219
um I I kind of wish I had

136
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:39,478
gone back through some f2s I made a few

137
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,759
f2s but I never really pursued it and

138
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:45,300
um you know at this point the seeds are

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,600
no longer viable unfortunately

140
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,400
but it's it's cool on there's um you

141
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,800
know I feel like if you F2 that you'd

142
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,739
open up a lot of stuff yeah

143
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,340
I mean Trace dog and chem 4 is kind of

144
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,978
like your own version of star dog

145
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:04,439
uh yeah right yeah yeah yeah I mean

146
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:06,899
isn't it isn't I mean it's it'd be a

147
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,939
different male or yeah it'd be a

148
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,459
different selection from the line

149
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,319
yeah yeah it was

150
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,538
um I just made a kind of personal amount

151
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,459
of them to go through it's like a I

152
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:21,120
always like to keep like a doomsday

153
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:23,879
stash of seeds you know

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,319
all my friends and all my cuts and just

155
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,379
like you know

156
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,539
I'm you know oh just a nobody floating

157
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,879
around out there I can have something to

158
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:35,818
go back to to look through even even

159
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,439
plants that I don't like out I usually

160
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,120
will pollinate them before I drop them

161
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,500
yeah because you just never know like

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,939
something down the line might trigger

163
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,259
that sense membrane you're like I really

164
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,639
wish I had that even though at the time

165
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,020
it doesn't even seem

166
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,300
viable or feasible for sure

167
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:54,318
yep and just you know it's fun to waste

168
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,740
all that space yeah all right and energy

169
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,600
and time time money man one thing I

170
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,579
thought about before before we get too

171
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,340
far away from it it's just the point I

172
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:07,439
might make which is that uh it's really

173
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:11,279
cool if you're doing a multi-stage

174
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,379
breeding thing to save seeds from every

175
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,959
stage of it

176
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:19,680
right so that way if you feel like you

177
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:22,318
screw up which is often you can go back

178
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,120
and be like oh I'd want to redo it so he

179
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
was just talking about I took it to F5

180
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,360
and I didn't really like some of the

181
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,478
direction that it went so I then I went

182
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,860
back all the way a few generations and

183
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,899
started taking it a different direction

184
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,240
you know I hear about that like people

185
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:39,000
say they do that all the time the theory

186
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,439
is very rarely any proof of anyone ever

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,538
doing that where like you've seen it

188
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,339
you've seen the seeds they were out

189
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,259
there's been x amount of years between

190
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,478
it and you know that that's possible and

191
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,060
I actually have the F5s of Appalachia

192
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,879
here from him so I know he took it to F5

193
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,379
and went back and I think that's that's

194
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,719
pretty commendable because you just

195
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,360
don't see it very often yeah

196
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,840
I also think like too like the the era

197
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,939
that that Hein Lonesome is talking about

198
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,859
it was I think it was more common for

199
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,379
people to like play around and work

200
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,598
their own little lines a bit it was way

201
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,459
before there was like a bunch of like

202
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,978
American Seed sales or anything like

203
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,959
that happening so now it's kind of like

204
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,519
you make seeds and it's a one-off and

205
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,318
they exist until they don't exist

206
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,878
anymore yeah

207
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,860
um but then I think it was a little bit

208
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,020
more common you know at least amongst

209
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,340
like weed nerds to like you know you

210
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,598
make something and then it kind of

211
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,158
becomes the base of what you're doing

212
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,218
and you cross it to this and you cross

213
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,599
it to that then you know it it and a lot

214
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,640
of it like he was saying it's all about

215
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,240
like I'm breeding for personal smoke

216
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,559
yeah

217
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,940
it gives you a lot more freedom than if

218
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,379
you're breeding for the market because

219
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,860
you're just breeding for things that you

220
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:52,439
like no it all you know the whole even

221
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:57,680
just growing it started by trying to

222
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,680
make sure I had the best quality weed

223
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,919
and I I think that's the best way to

224
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,919
breed

225
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,399
you're not being true to yourself if

226
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,379
you're not because how are you going to

227
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,899
enjoy the smoke and like go through tons

228
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,759
of different you know examples yeah and

229
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,200
not enjoy it and and pick a keeper that

230
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,059
you don't enjoy that's really hard to do

231
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,339
yeah you want to be stoked on what

232
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,319
you're doing right sure yeah you can

233
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,480
lose a lot of a lot of uh passion for

234
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,040
something real fast by by cheapening it

235
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,659
that way in my opinion I mean there's

236
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,278
some people out there that like all

237
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:30,899
their phenos and stuff that they they

238
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,700
get found get found by other people

239
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,278
because those breeders don't crack them

240
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,620
themselves oh yeah they make them name

241
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,600
them package them sell them and then

242
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,100
they find out through others whether or

243
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
not anything good happened

244
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,220
oh yeah

245
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,899
you know I would say that's kind of

246
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,399
become the standard these days a little

247
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,799
bit but in the era that high and

248
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,600
Lonesome is talking about which is you

249
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,719
know 15 plus years ago or whatever I

250
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,459
don't think that was the standard then

251
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,620
um you could get rid of anything back

252
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,479
then oh yeah

253
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,159
and before we straight too far I do want

254
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,120
to to ask because I know this is going

255
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,299
to be the number one question people

256
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,360
want to know when did you meet

257
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:12,778
be Bodhi and when did he acquire the

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,680
Appalachia from you to work

259
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:20,338
um so he and I had been you know

260
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:22,620
chatting and exchanging seeds on uh I

261
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,940
think it might have originally been I

262
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,600
see mag

263
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,459
um but probably 06 ish

264
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,680
um you know he'd send me a few things he

265
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:34,379
made I'd send him a few things I made

266
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,019
and I uh when I did the uh tray style

267
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,919
crosses I believe I sent all of them to

268
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,440
him

269
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,240
um just for him to check out and

270
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,240
um I didn't even know he'd popped any

271
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,060
until he uh hit me up asking if it was

272
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,299
okay if he released some seeds that he

273
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:53,578
had made with the Appalachia

274
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,439
um I think you know

275
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:56,879
I'm not sure it was something that he

276
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,440
meant to do but that's just kind of how

277
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,539
it worked out

278
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,540
um and he made some really cool stuff

279
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:06,059
and I mean people are still popping it

280
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:09,120
people are still passing out cuts from

281
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:11,338
those seeds that's um it was definitely

282
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,839
a very comprehensive job he did of

283
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,940
Crossing it to everything relevant at

284
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,279
that time

285
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,959
I know it's a very common sentiment that

286
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,578
a lot of people feel that some of their

287
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,399
favorite stuff came from that you know

288
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:25,559
like the the Appalachia crosses and one

289
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,360
of my favorite moments ever in life was

290
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,338
being able to to watch you and Buddy

291
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,720
meet in person for the first time and

292
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:36,860
then right away in the sunset

293
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,860
how sweet is that dude together

294
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,679
you know you meet him in person and he's

295
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,500
actually genuine you know it's it's a

296
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:52,139
rare thing but he's as nice as he comes

297
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,578
off and just a hell of a cool guy yeah

298
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,019
you know and you know we were all

299
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:57,379
holding hands stirring out the windows

300
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,060
you guys drove off

301
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,458
too bad it wasn't into the sunset you

302
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,778
know

303
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:07,259
right it was just almost a little bit

304
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:10,740
past Sunrise I think everybody has hello

305
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:14,659
going on though yeah yeah I had I had a

306
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,659
nice uh pregnant glow the next morning

307
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,120
so Pat let's talk about some of your

308
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,919
stuff dude like uh yeah man you kind of

309
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,959
popped out of the Woodworks with uh some

310
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,399
old Cuts you have an old Afghan cut that

311
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,379
you work with

312
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,778
um you work with a lot of train wreck

313
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,519
stuff uh one of your big releases your

314
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,159
first big drop was a train wreck

315
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,440
reversal and you hit a few things uh do

316
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,199
you want to talk about some of that

317
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,200
sure man you know uh

318
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,060
where do I begin you know I've uh

319
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,680
always kind of had interest in genetics

320
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,599
you know just growing over the years and

321
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,699
what have you but um

322
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,278
initially when I got into the game it

323
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,800
was all clones for me you know and my

324
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,659
crew and so yeah you come across the

325
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,819
occasional seat back or somebody you

326
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,740
know like we'd shoot up to uh where is

327
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
it up to PC and grab things once in a

328
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
while

329
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,260
um not beansters but you know whatever

330
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,419
seeds I had hidden in the corners up

331
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,759
there in Gaslamp area

332
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,379
um so you know as much as seeds were

333
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,360
available and like not so I was told

334
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,399
stories you know a lot of that was going

335
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,839
on down down south from where I was at

336
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,399
that point I was

337
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,920
where I'm thinking is when I was living

338
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,778
up in Humboldt uh up in the northern

339
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,879
part of the county

340
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:28,139
um you know scenes were prolific down

341
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,759
there right there's a reason that

342
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,139
generations of people you know breeding

343
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,458
and whatnot but clones are just so

344
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,959
accessible back in the day that there

345
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,359
wasn't really a need to go hunting and

346
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,799
yeah try to find whatever

347
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,419
um so it always kind of been on my radar

348
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,039
but it never been necessarily something

349
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,620
I turned towards

350
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,240
and then uh you know

351
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,039
um being in the game long enough you

352
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,659
come across certain cuts that you just

353
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,759
fall in love with even if they fall out

354
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,078
of style and what have you and

355
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,299
you know

356
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,919
um I caught on pretty quick in the 2000s

357
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,419
you know to the kind of turnover of

358
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,979
things you know you'd see something just

359
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,778
be prolific and then would disappear and

360
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,940
you wouldn't see it again and so it

361
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,338
determined that I would have to you know

362
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,500
hold on to some of these things and see

363
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,060
where that goes and so just you know

364
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,799
years pass and all of a sudden you

365
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,419
become this keeper of

366
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,240
whatever the hell you thought was good

367
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:18,179
from way back when and um so that's kind

368
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,820
of in terms of just what my

369
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,919
uh you know the way my path was laid out

370
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,778
with the whole garden scene so so you

371
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,500
know fast forward to now

372
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,240
um

373
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,740
you know I've always been on on the DL

374
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,060
for the most part with what I do and I

375
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,579
didn't really have a big intention of

376
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,799
riding the wave into the legal market

377
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:38,778
and try to go too heavy there

378
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,778
um I like Patricia worked there

379
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,339
um and uh and so I decided Well you know

380
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,859
hey man this is part of my life right

381
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,260
I'm not gonna just move on it's growing

382
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,180
as my therapy and so

383
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,919
um but I also am kind of bored here and

384
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,439
I don't feel like living by the

385
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,000
algorithm of the garden so to speak like

386
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,399
I had for so many years and I needed

387
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,440
some kind of pivot right so

388
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,539
um just like anything you know consider

389
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,019
doing that for years but played around

390
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,819
but then uh you know uh come the time

391
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,799
that I I'm starting to get real bored

392
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,660
not wanting to to move forward growing

393
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,099
weight anymore I thought you know this

394
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,319
is that right time to have fun right and

395
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,959
get into the genetic side of things

396
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,519
um yeah and so what do I do you know

397
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,219
I'll just kind of tick what I had in my

398
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,259
uh Armory and started messing around and

399
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,360
here we are how did you find the crew in

400
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,039
the first place

401
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,379
it's a good question

402
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,439
um this crew right here this crew I came

403
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:42,838
across I came across you guys you know

404
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,880
unlike some some of the other cats in

405
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,440
this in this field like I stayed true to

406
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,299
trying to stay under the radar so I

407
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,480
never got into the forums back in the

408
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,159
day and I mean not so nose boot you know

409
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,480
send people to go buy your supplies at

410
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,539
the store and not have your license

411
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,039
plate get uh oh yeah or whatever so I'm

412
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,379
just kind of always abided by that code

413
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,039
and never got onto the forums and then

414
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,799
um

415
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:08,399
IG comes around I would say maybe 2017

416
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,379
16 17 18 something like that and

417
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,179
started thinking about reversals I'm

418
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:14,039
like hey man I got this this tdub cut

419

00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,919
so start paying attention and as a

422
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,680

436
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,699
he vouched for me in terms of being uh

437
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,680
somebody relatively solid in the field

438
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,659
or whatever you know what it for me what

439
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,939

anyone ever been able to show me bud of

446
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,279
it I've seen pictures of stuff that look

447
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,779
just like it but when I would get it it

448
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,220
would smell like [ __ ] flow or

449
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:23,220
something like that you know it just was

450
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,838
awesome it would look just like it and

451
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,058
then you brought it down and I was like

452
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,519

blue dream he has train wreck too he's a

454
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,058
little time capsules

455
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,980
[Music]

456
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:37,740
it wasn't just that it was how well they

457
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,140
were grown how well they were cured all

458
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,640
of it it was I hit all the points and I

459
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,400
was like God this guy cares about his

460
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,259
[ __ ] weed a lot you know he cares

461
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,480
about good weed and that's kind of where

462
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:49,980
I I realized like this this is legit I

463
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,380
want to see where this dude what did

464
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,919
what this dude's story is and without

465
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,419
going into detail too much detail

466
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,799
um obviously you come from like the surf

467
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,780
background right

468
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,660
yeah you could say that I mean Central

469
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,220
Coast Coastal Life yeah for sure I mean

470
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm not I'm not a big I'm not a big

471
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,360
Surfer I was a skater snowboarder kind

472
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,179
of but that was a part of your culture

473
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,798
who you hung out the kind of yeah why

474
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,960
you would have had access to these

475
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,639
certain clones in the first place yeah

476
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,980
yeah it's definitely tied in it's tied

477
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,840
into the whole lifestyle of just you

478
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,700
know growing up in the in the 90s over

479
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,079
here on the Central Coast like

480
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,298
you were getting away from him you

481
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,980
couldn't find way you found a surfer but

482
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:31,500
yeah you know I was I was selling the

483
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,179
weed to the Surfers so you know

484
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,160
and Surfers usually had a pretty good

485
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,660
choice of weed back then like a lot of

486
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,759
them would travel around the world get

487
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,679
some of the best wheat on Earth so to

488
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,679
have it having the kind of clientele you

489
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,460
did without being specific it

490
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,100
um

491
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,558
I learned you know

492
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,240
that you had to perform better than

493
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:52,379
others to have the kind of clientele you

494
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,079
did at the time

495
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,940
which I took notice of and why why I

496
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,678
realized you you had gotten so good at

497
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,058
curing and drying and all that other

498
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,220
stuff because they were they were pretty

499
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:03,538
high in clientele well and they're

500
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,940
pretty picky man you know I mean yeah

501
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,440
their dads were Growers and they grew up

502
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,840
in the whole scene and they're around

503
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,880
the world yeah so exactly you can't you

504
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,259
can't bring schwag to those dudes and be

505
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,200
like yeah I want a good price for this

506
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,660
that's just not gonna happen no no one

507
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,519
thing one thing maybe I should interject

508
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,080
is like since high and Lonesome was

509
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,879
talking about Green Crack and now we're

510
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,980
talking with pack about blue dream and

511
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,020
train wreck is that there's some of

512
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,079
these things that like they became

513
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,879
famous long enough ago and then kind of

514
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,980
fell out of favor long enough ago that

515
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,200
people probably mostly only hear legends

516
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,240
about them to some degree and a lot of

517
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,100
people like Matt was saying get fakes or

518
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,259
you know or get it poorly grown for

519
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,119
whatever reason feed versions where they

520
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,819
use the name one of the things that

521
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,639
sucks about that is that often people

522
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:53,759
talk about why they got burned out on a

523
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:58,140
certain cut not wide that cut had

524
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,879
lasting fans to begin with yeah yeah you

525
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,500
know and I think with both with the

526
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,260
three things I just named with you know

527
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,298
Green Crack or with uh you know train

528
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:08,819
wreck or blue dream all three of those

529
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,440
you know uh there's a reason there's

530
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,178
there's a bunch of reasons why they got

531
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,360
popular and people really enjoyed them

532
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:17,160
yeah and then they

533
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,079
um you know they ended up getting burned

534
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,140
out you know because people were growing

535
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,819
huge amounts of it and once huge amounts

536
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,940
of it start growing a lot of people

537
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:28,918
start doing it poorly yeah you know and

538
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,019
and then all of a sudden it gets a bad

539
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,660
reputation and then something moves on

540
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,339
and people lose track of the quality and

541
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,440
like you were saying like maybe only a

542
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:40,319
few people end up holding on to it

543
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,140
and then people are surprised at how

544
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,639
good this thing they've heard of

545
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,960
but maybe in derogatory terms oh yeah

546
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,759
you know and I don't mean you know I

547
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,679
just like there was a lot for me like

548
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,379
when when high and Lonesome was talking

549
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,179
I was thinking about how you know like

550
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,100
basically once people in like Grass

551
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,080
Valley and certain other regions got

552
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:03,619
green crack and started growing seven to

553
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:07,259
ten pound outdoor plants

554
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:08,819
that kind of like mid Z Green Crack is

555
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,400
what blue

556
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:14,339
got turned people away from it but it

557
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,320
became accessible but you know Green

558
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,058
Crack is you know in extracts and

559
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,859
something like that it actually has a

560
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:21,480
bunch of really nice Terps it has a

561
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:24,659
bunch of really nice structure to it it

562
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:28,079
has a very like cool flavor done well

563
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:31,380
you know yeah indoor 70-day green crack

564
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:34,500
is tough to beat it really good like

565
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,000
yeah I'm looking so far too right and he

566
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,679
just said what out the other thing that

567
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,019
happens to people is they grow it too

568
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,179
big and then they end up taking it 10 or

569
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:45,240
12 days early because it's it's done

570
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:47,100
enough to pass oh yeah it makes all the

571
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,440
difference too so then the market gets

572
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:51,000
flooded with a bunch of you know I mean

573
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
it definitely happened with green crack

574
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,779
it definitely both happened with blue

575
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,179
dream and train wreck all three sort of

576
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,759
suffered the same fate and that they

577
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:02,880
could be enough of a production plant

578
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,099
that they got over produced and people

579
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,419
thought the production version was the

580
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:09,178
version

581
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:11,640
when in reality

582
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,440
I think Blue Dream took a bigger hit I

583
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,299
think Blue Dream took a much bigger hit

584
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,580
than just that

585
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,679
um Green Crack didn't because I I knew

586
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,939
who was who was releasing seeds of it

587
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,259
and who wasn't and there weren't a lot

588
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,460
of Siege released to Green Crack there

589
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,558
were like green crack seeds out there

590
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,079
you could buy up in Mass you know but

591
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,720
Blue Dream the second that thing kicked

592
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,119
off we had Emerald Triangle seeds which

593
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,980
was I believe made in Spain

594
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,119
um there was a you had Humboldt Seeds

595
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,460
you had all these different companies

596
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,219
releasing their versions of what blue

597
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,900
dream was which was whatever's bulk

598
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,839
Spanish company was pushing out as their

599
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,500
blueberry Haze I mean and that's what

600
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,720
cuts got passed around is blue dream

601
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,058
I'm saying Vince

602
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,659
yeah yeah exactly yeah I'm convinced hnl

603
00:22:54,058 --> 00:23:00,658
that like in the in the dab era uh Green

604
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:03,120
Crack has been named renamed papaya

605
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,700
oh yeah a lot of a lot of those like

606
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,798
tropical Terps and stuff like that like

607
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,240
they would never call it a green crack

608
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:14,099
extract no right

609
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,480
Green Crack rosin and they'd be like oh

610
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:20,759
this is the papaya yeah

611
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,819
papaya this is the papaya you know this

612
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,819
is some tropical fruity and not to say

613
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:28,678
that natto has any knowledge that the

614
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,240
papaya strain out there from the

615
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,880
specific company is Green Crack he's

616
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,359
saying that's a probably what happens oh

617
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,919
well you know even 15 years ago when

618
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,859
people didn't want to buy green crack

619
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:45,000
around here it went as mango it went as

620
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,199
papaya fish yeah yeah it just you know

621
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,058
that happens

622
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,080
there's half a dozen names for blue

623
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,960
dream

624
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,939
oh yeah and maybe even more that got

625
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,500
made because people got blown out on it

626
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,519
and they're like oh this isn't that this

627
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,038
is blue dragon yes this is you know it

628
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,359
reminds me of your Barry White story

629
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,240
yeah yeah

630
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,519
you know I mean it's true and uh and but

631
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,220
you know the point that I'll I'll scroll

632
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,379
back on is that if you take somebody who

633
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,079
knows the strain like say pack or high

634
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,659
in Lonesome and they grow a nice two

635
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,339
three four six ounce plant either in a

636
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:22,919
greenhouse or in an indoor environment

637
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:25,859
people are going to be blown away by how

638
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,600
good it is oh yeah

639
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,879
blew over the party away I think people

640
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,798
have forgotten absolutely why those

641
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,419
things got so popular in the first place

642
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:34,918
and they only think they got popular

643
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:37,620
because you could get an eight pound

644
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,020
outdoor plant that was bigger yeah yeah

645
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:42,959
and that's not what got them popular in

646
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:46,400
the beginning at all it's just not yeah

647
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,000
it was a grow in somebody's closet

648
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
yep

649
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,019
I mean a three ounce a three ounce Green

650
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Crack plant is delicious yeah it really

651
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,460
is you know I think a four ounce Blue

652
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,380
Dream is damn Delicious especially how

653
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,298
long did you take it back this last time

654
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,000
uh for the party I pulled it early

655
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:10,259
actually yeah I know it's weird yeah I

656
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,720
think I pulled it at 60 60 61 days maybe

657
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:16,140
and it was super Berry for me yeah that

658
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,819
was nice that was the best I've ever had

659
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,100
for sure

660
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:24,079
that was killer

661
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:26,759
when you grow a cut for you know 15.

662
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,038
better you better put out some work some

663
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,200
good work after you know 20 years I mean

664
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,359
really what one of the things I you know

665
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,640
I remember talking to CSI about this

666
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,459
probably I don't know eight years ago or

667
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,080
something where in his mind going back

668
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,840
to what pack was saying about where he

669
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,359
was up in Humboldt and stuff uh train

670
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,359
wreck was one of the first named clones

671
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,178
yeah yeah that really spread around the

672
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,859
growing Community deeply in that zone

673
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,659
like there was lots of seeds and there

674
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:57,298
was lots of name stuff that got like

675
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:59,520
here and there it popped up but like

676
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:01,980
train wreck really kind of had its

677
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,298
moment hey man that was the first strain

678
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,798
that you started seeing people wear

679
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,019
t-shirts with the name train wreck

680
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,579
across the front oh really I've never

681
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:10,619
seen the shirts I want to see for sure

682
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:13,798
yeah humble humble clothing company I

683
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:16,199
think it was up in up in Arcata uh 2001

684
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,359
something like that they they got smart

685
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,640
and started marketing strains on shirts

686
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,500
and yeah there weren't many but train

687
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,299
wreck was the one that was like you know

688
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,700
what you saw perfect and you're right

689
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:28,918
and you know what uh we never referred

690
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,480
to it or at least my crew being up in

691
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,559
Arcata it was never the Arcata train

692
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,640
wreck until

693
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:37,079
years later yeah as a signifier you know

694
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,940
in terms of where it came from it was

695
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,220
just tracks t-dub or train ride yeah

696
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,798
yeah I think that popped up on the

697
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,740
forums as a designator you know once

698
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,480
once it needed to be a few fake cuts and

699
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,400
you know people would talk a lot about

700
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,360
the you know this is the arcade of cut

701
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,220
or this is the e32 yeah 32 crew or

702
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,599
whatever

703
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,519
lemon rack was another one that was

704
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,918
floating around at that point yeah yeah

705
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,379
it seemed to pop up once uh people

706
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,240
started releasing seeds I think the

707
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,278
Dutch

708
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,500
started started messing with it and uh

709
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:14,400
wood horse

710
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:17,159
was it it was talking wood horse yeah

711
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,320
tuck and wood horse the big train I

712
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,179
remember using name dropping him again

713
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,038
but I remember when uh even though

714
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,480
they're discredited when philos first

715
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,538
came out or something

716
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,440
uh CSI called me up and he goes do you

717
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:34,679
want to know what uh what DNA's uh Lemon

718
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,700
Skunk test as and I was all what and

719
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,720
he's all Green Crack oh yeah

720
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,798
unfortunately yeah I mean like it kind

721
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,140
of makes sense like if they're both

722
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,240
skunk one they would kind of like maybe

723
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,620
show up in some range together

724
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,259
oh yeah

725
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:50,939
but I I just think like there's you know

726
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,519
and train wreck also the other thing

727
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,679
train wreck got known for was that it

728
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,259
was the like but long before anyone used

729
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,380
the word terpenoline

730
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:03,960
um you know uh train wreck Terps yeah

731
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,760
exactly yeah it got it got kind of a

732
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,919
moniker of like oh people didn't know

733
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,658
what that terp was but train wreck was

734
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,100
famous and well known I'm like oh this

735
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:14,600
kind of smells like train wreck to me

736
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,599
yeah it's got a train wreck smell

737
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,039
yeah

738
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,840
right you know but those it's so it's

739
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,400
kind of like it's it's almost a bad

740
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,798
thing I don't want to say it's almost a

741
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,679
bad thing but any strain that has the

742
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,960
potential to be blown out huge

743
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,538
has the potential to get a bad

744
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,600
reputation because people only try it

745
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:42,000
blown out huge not dried right not cured

746
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,980
right like Matt was saying about Pack's

747
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,839
ability to dry it and cure it and treat

748
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,819
it nicely

749
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,500
um and so sometimes even getting a good

750
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:53,158
example of what made something famous

751
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,798
can be harder yeah sure yeah and and

752
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,840
I'll tell you what man you know there's

753
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:59,400
there's times where I put it out and I

754
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,918
won't smoke those chicks I'm like no

755
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,440
that's not no I don't want to share that

756
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,659
with somebody yeah for sure it's not

757
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,659
oh yeah we all have this Those runs

758
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,260
our buddy uh our you know we had some

759
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,939
friends of ours at the Gathering that we

760
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:16,200
had or whatever that are quite a bit

761
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,440
younger than us

762
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,259
and it was really cool to have them try

763
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,720
some of the classics yeah that it faded

764
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:28,319
from popularity like long before they

765
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,360
came onto the scene yeah yeah that was

766
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,519
really neat for me actually you know

767
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,619
that's where I noticed like the kids

768
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,960
love the blue green they're like this is

769
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:39,479
Blue Dream what this is what it's like

770
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,000
what were people talking about just

771
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,360
watching HML push Trainwreck on poor

772
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,839
local oh my God how'd that go I didn't

773
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,839
see that part

774
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,000
it's 10 o'clock man I'm way older than

775
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,740
you you need to get here

776
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,940
you need to go take a train wreck bomb

777
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,940
hit so here

778
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,379
this is where this is right before I put

779
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:09,740
a Sharpie in his in his pocket to wake

780
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,740
him up

781
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:15,119
I was listening to an interview that

782
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,859
pack had uh did not very long ago last

783
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,599
week or something yeah and I remember

784
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:20,459
you talking about like train wreck was

785
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:22,139
the weed that like you pulled some bong

786
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,980
rips right before you had to do a bunch

787
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,740
of work

788
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,480
oh yeah like it was get after it weed

789
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,058
you know it gave you that buzz where you

790
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,740
felt like you could get some [ __ ] done

791
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:33,240
absolutely and particularly so much so

792
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,759
if you if you pulled a little bit early

793
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,440
you know like you can train wreck's got

794
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,940
such a range of when you can pull it and

795
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,620
what you want to get off of it sure does

796
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,320
you pulled a little bit early and it's

797
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:45,719
just so much more Speedy you know yeah

798
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,579
I feel like that's part of uh part of

799
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,339
what gave it its reputation of you know

800
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:52,379
big blown out plants pulled it you know

801
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:55,199
50 days because it it looks good enough

802
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,240
at 50 days at seven weeks you can yank

803
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,740
it yeah

804
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,480
that's why drink crap is Big with us

805
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,339
because like it's seven weeks if you

806
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,380
found it out yeah it's all about getting

807
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:06,898
700 of them in in a year if you're doing

808
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,940
indoor you know so yeah maybe that

809
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,379
that's the and that's another key why

810
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,778
people end up getting feel like

811
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,820
something's not that great I can't even

812
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:18,538
tell you how much Sour Diesel in

813
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:22,259
Mendocino County was pulled as soon as

814
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:23,579
it was good enough to go oh yeah like it

815
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,679
probably should have gone into the mid

816
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:27,720
70s and it hit 60 and they're like it's

817
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,220
ready hey man you're not doing it for

818
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,440
the love at that point though you know

819
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,600
what I'm saying no I get it but you know

820
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,278
but it's like people just don't I don't

821
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,079
think people see like that's the part

822
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,859
about love that I don't think people get

823
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:43,199
where it's like you know if you it's

824
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:44,819
hard to come across people that know how

825
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,100
to grow it the right way that will take

826
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,200
it the right amount of time that'll dry

827
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:51,959
it and cure it the right way so you get

828
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,019
that full effect there's a lot of it's

829
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,240
good enough to go yeah and it's good

830
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:59,519
enough for the the buyer won't reject it

831
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,440
hey man I'll tell you what I can't say

832
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,700
I'm not guilty of that in my past you

833
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,259
know especially at certain points in

834
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,778
time where it was more economically

835
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:09,599
feasible than you know just for the love

836
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:11,759
but I think when you stay in it long

837
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,278
enough at least for me it's like you

838
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,898
kind of mature into your grower status

839
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,000
right like

840
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:19,199
starting off Riding High Times I want to

841
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,759
grow everything I've got to get it all

842
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,259
whatever but then you start to kind of

843
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,798
not only dial in the plant but you dial

844
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:24,798
in your style

845
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:31,158
it was a different world too you know

846
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,179
consumers

847
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:36,299
there wasn't you know as many

848
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,559
connoisseurs people just they wanted a

849
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:40,139
bag of weed

850
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,940
um and you know they wanted it to be

851
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,380
pretty and taste good and you know if

852
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,740
you could accomplish that and then get a

853
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:49,320
buzz it was all good to be fair like if

854
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,819
I was doing something outside like any

855
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,519
of the things we just mentioned and it

856
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:55,019
was fall I could probably let it go if I

857
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,259
got good weather until it was perfect

858
00:32:55,019 --> 00:33:00,298
right yeah but if I'm dapping it and

859
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:02,640
it's 90 to 100 degrees every day in

860
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:04,500
Mendo I'm gonna hit a point where it's

861
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,259
all downhill from here

862
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,240
and I might not get that last five to

863
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:10,919
seven days that I would prefer out of it

864
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,140
because it's going to go south because

865
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,519
it's 98 and it's hot and the flowers the

866
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,519
calyxes are going to start to yellow

867
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,319
it's going to start to get beat up I

868
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,319
gotta pay my rent you know yeah yeah

869
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:24,599
yeah you know here we had we had

870
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,119
hurricanes every fall you know or most

871
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:30,298
every fall and so you know in October

872
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,798
you might get you know six inches of

873
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:33,839
rain in a week

874
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,538
um you know it just it can be terrible

875
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:39,418
and so sometimes it was good enough to

876
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:41,339
go October one you know it's done

877
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,019
I try to explain that to people all the

878
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:45,119
time when it comes to like nature

879
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:48,120
farming you know where you're using

880
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,038
using the Sun or whatever that uh all

881
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,579
downhill from here is an important

882
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,500
decision to come to yeah it is it really

883
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:57,778
is key because you can you can be like

884
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,778
oh I can make it better and then you're

885
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:01,919
like I just made it worse

886
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:03,599
I mean one of the reasons one of the

887
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,640
reasons why I stuck to indoor growing

888
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,019
because you know you get to play God in

889
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,898
terms of how long and something's going

890
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:11,280
to go and and I mean obviously you know

891
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:13,739
there's there's

892
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,780
good and bad with both but um it's it's

893
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,118
an interesting uh distinction because as

894
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,500
an indoor grower mainly you know that

895
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,240
wasn't a consideration right what time

896
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,338
of the year it was unless you know I

897
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,779
didn't have the right kind of insulation

898
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:28,079
in that in the place that I'm growing or

899
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:31,679
whatnot sure um yeah

900
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,000
here we use I mean you know indoor

901
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,338
you know not that a lot of people

902
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,898
wouldn't go outside or whatever but the

903
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:38,639
problem up here was that it got so hot

904
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:39,659
and dry we always used to call it summer

905
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,539
bud

906
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,280
yeah same same here like you knew that

907
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,719
you knew the indoor summer Bud even just

908
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,700
because it was like you cannot keep your

909
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,799
[ __ ] under a hundred just because it's

910
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,098
like people are running Mini Splits back

911
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,200
in the day you know no

912
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:57,720
way we didn't you know it didn't that

913
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,399
kind of technology is all the stuff

914
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:01,739
that's common now I don't think people

915
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,079
realized how slowly we had some of us

916
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:06,379
adopted it remember how hot the lights

917
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,380
were

918
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,920
where I had three exposed bulbs hanging

919
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,200
in the middle and you had to get in

920
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,539
there to do whatever that was always so

921
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,618
brutal

922
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:31,940
dude like you know I always heard these

923
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,940
wives tales of that guy

924
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,500
River seeing my skin hanging off a bulb

925
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:38,940
and sizzling and it being just fine and

926
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,619
it was it was cooking the skin just fine

927
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,539
it didn't explode but I always heard

928
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:44,400
like yeah don't get your finger oils on

929
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,920
that bulb it'll blow up so I was always

930
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,240
water yeah I don't know people are like

931
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,440
finger oils like so I'd always like

932
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:55,078
screw them in all careful like oh yeah

933
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,380
yeah and screw it in because I didn't

934
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,380
want it

935
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,659
don't need them exploding

936
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,460
I don't know

937
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,259
maybe it was true there was a couple

938
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,659
times in life where like they hit the

939
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,660
top of my ear

940
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:14,279
that was pretty sensitive spot yeah

941
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:16,980
cause I'm a tall I'm a tall guy you know

942
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,820
and so yeah me too you're moving around

943
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,199
and you're trying to yeah you know but

944
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,760
yeah

945
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,639
but one of the things that we should

946
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,900
mention too is that you know and I don't

947
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,239
know high and Lonesome if you want to

948
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:33,180
talk about this but I would imagine that

949
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:37,139
when you were crossing uh Trace dog to

950
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:38,519
uh you know to Green Crack

951
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,838
um maybe you could talk for a minute

952
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:41,400
about like something that I'm always

953
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,199
interested in which is like what you

954
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,599
were hoping each parent was going to

955
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:49,858
bring to the children

956
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,680
um yeah well um you know basically the

957
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:56,098
only issues I had with spring crack

958
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,239
um were the structure of the plant and

959
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:02,519
then

960
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:05,578
um the uh the structure and the high of

961
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,739
the plant so I wanted to get something

962
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:10,260
with a little bit more robust trucker

963
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:13,679
and something that you know had a little

964
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,780
more uh not depth to the high because I

965
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,759
think the care the character of Green

966
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,519
Crack is really nice but just something

967
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,440
that maybe hits you a little bit harder

968
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:25,139
behind the eyes yeah it's still a skunk

969
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,740
one high at the end of the day yeah I

970
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:31,319
mean yeah yeah I mean green crack in my

971
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:33,659
opinion is just skunk one um it's yeah

972
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,640
probably my favorite yeah yeah it's

973
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,618
really good one it's definitely my

974
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:41,659
favorite of the skunk one type plants so

975
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:41,660
I have big margin yeah yeah

976
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:48,419
you know cheese is great I have run that

977
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,760
several times over the years I just

978
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,820
I can't smoke it but so much but

979
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,720
something about the like rotten mango

980
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:59,400
Green Crack is just so appealing

981
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,078
and another one of your your really

982
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,358
well-known cuts and this is probably

983
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,060
what I knew you best for and one of the

984
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,098
cuts I chased the longest was the poodle

985
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:09,960
nuts Kai can you talk a little bit about

986
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:14,820
that who selected the cut where it came

987
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:18,900
from Etc that was um it was selected by

988
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:20,460
a friend of mine from IC uh it went by

989
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,579
40 grit

990
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,079
um and then I think after that 40 ounce

991
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:28,320
uh several several names over the years

992
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,960
but yeah he was blowing up warehouses of

993
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,200
Urkel before anybody else he always had

994
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,820
the most dialed in Oracle his [ __ ] you

995
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:37,919
know I remember smoking his weed and it

996
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,320
just being it was like slingshotting

997
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,838
though it was dense but it wasn't you

998
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,599
know blown out it was like perfect

999
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,578
and uh his problem was he was running

1000
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,940
warehouses of Oracle he needed something

1001
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:53,880
with some hybrid Vigor then he and I

1002
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,920
used to yeah [ __ ] a bunch so you

1003
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,200
know that was one that when I was making

1004
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,960
those crosses I kind of pollinated the

1005
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:04,019
Urkle just to see if it was any more

1006
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,699
vigorous so I uh you know once the seeds

1007
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:08,759
were done I sent a bunch out to him and

1008
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:10,679
he he ran him he found I think two cuts

1009
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,859
that he really liked but that one was

1010
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:16,259
the one that looked more Earthly and it

1011
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:19,319
you know it got purple but it had

1012
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,359
increased Vigor and increased potency so

1013
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,539
he started you know running warehouses

1014
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,039
with that and crushing it loved it yeah

1015
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:28,019
nice and

1016
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,179
yeah and

1017
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:31,920
his I mean his cut his selection is

1018
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:35,399
beautiful I've grown it

1019
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,539
um I've crossed it to some stuff

1020
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,639
um that line it ended up being you know

1021
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:43,559
as you went through generations of it

1022
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:48,598
there was just more weird stuff popping

1023
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:51,539
up from the Urkel purple man yeah yeah I

1024
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,760
took it I think to F4

1025
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:56,159
and it was just you know you'd get more

1026
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,359
mutants and it would just it didn't have

1027
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,500
the Vigor uh

1028
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,679
I don't know I could have [ __ ] it up

1029
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,599
but uh you know it just it's one of

1030
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:07,799
those things that I couldn't go but so

1031
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,559
deep into

1032
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,019
I I can understand that um the actual

1033
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,179
poodle nuts cut is super unique looking

1034
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:17,900
like I've seen it expressed this really

1035
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:20,940
unique trait where it looks super knobby

1036
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,680
it's very hard to describe and and I've

1037
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,240
seen pictures of some of the outcrosses

1038
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:26,819
that have that same trait you know what

1039
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,739
I'm talking about yeah like bud

1040
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,460
structure yeah yeah they're not knobby

1041
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:34,979
bud structure yeah yeah yeah that's um

1042
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,220
yeah that that kind of surprised me it's

1043
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,460
not quite the you know round balls you

1044
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:42,419
get with Urkel um but it's it's great

1045
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,760
weed

1046
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,920
um dude yeah it's beautiful it smells

1047
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,599
and I've told people this a million

1048
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,820
times like people always talk about

1049
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,800
smelling cut smelling really Rank and

1050
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,380
veg and that's a perfect example of one

1051
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,060
for me where I can take cuts of that in

1052
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,858
the living room and in the bedroom Bryn

1053
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:00,358
B like did the skunk spray in here

1054
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:02,578
because it really does smell like skunk

1055
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,880
spray when you kind of like yeah veg I

1056
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:07,560
think it's Veg it's insane yeah yeah and

1057
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,019
then it finishes up so sweet and nice

1058
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,460
you know yeah I know it's very Earthly

1059
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:13,380
of it because like Urkel does something

1060
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,079
similar it has that similar skunky smell

1061
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,599
and veg and you take cuts and it's like

1062
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,160
wow this is gonna be skunky AF and then

1063
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,019
when you when you flour it it's super

1064
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,598
grapey in the end you know it almost

1065
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:26,400
gets there and for people that are

1066
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,440
younger or don't know or weren't around

1067
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,619
during the Urkel era

1068
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,800
um one of the big issues with Urkel was

1069
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,559
that it's not a very branchy mob it's

1070
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,200
not easy to get a lot of cuts off it and

1071
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:43,380
a lot of people would veg it for a long

1072
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,118
time before they bloomed it because it's

1073
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,940
kind of a slow grower

1074
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,358
you know it's not Urban no spacing is

1075
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,679
insane that's my problem

1076
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:54,719
is one of those ones that you kind of

1077
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,000
have to get it around the size you want

1078
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,199
it to be when you bloom it yeah and then

1079
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,300
it's going to grow like six or eight

1080
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,799
inches and stop it's not like a diesel

1081
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,560
or something that has a butt like it's

1082
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,720
going to double or triple in size and

1083
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,880
Branch out it's just not going to so

1084
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,439
when Ian Lonesome was talking about like

1085
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,420
his buddy wanting something with a

1086
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,059
little bit better vigor

1087
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,579
uh Urkel took its time

1088
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:19,259
okay it kind of puttered along you know

1089
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,599
it was that for me it was the node

1090
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,540
spacing it just it was it was just

1091
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,119
constant just like no space centimeters

1092
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:29,279
yeah you had to thin it out and just

1093
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,680
constantly stay on it it took forever to

1094
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,540
veg it used to be you know you could

1095
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,460
grow a haze in the same time you could

1096
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:36,800
grow Urkel because you're gonna have to

1097
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,838
bed

1098
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,519
three times as long four times as long

1099
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,920
and then when you flower it you know

1100
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,320
it's it's gonna pretty much stay that

1101
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,420
size like natto said six to eight inches

1102
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,000
and that's all you're doing no jumping

1103
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,220
no jumping most of my friends up here

1104
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,380
that were successful growing Urkel they

1105
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,299
would be blooming a round of Urkel and

1106
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,380
they would be vegging almost the entire

1107
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,599
bloom

1108
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,940
oh yeah for their next round to get the

1109
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,460
Urkel of his like the root ball and just

1110
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,900
the plan to be a sufficient size that

1111
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,400
they could then throw it into the bloom

1112
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,380
when the when the other round was done

1113
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,139
and get going come to think of it

1114
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,000
another cut that got bastardized by like

1115
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:17,400
being passed all around and a lot of

1116
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,079
crappy grows at it because like you know

1117
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,059
you always hear about how like lame and

1118
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,920
unpotent Urkel is but like I've had my

1119
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,739
head ripped off by good Urkel like

1120
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,220
really legit put in my ass by good Urkel

1121
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:31,078
it's just rare

1122
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:33,598
it all comes down to the grower and you

1123
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,400
know the conditions if you grow a giant

1124
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,300
outdoor Urkel it's just not going to be

1125
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,460
that quality no I don't like Urkel quite

1126
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,400
a bit but I I have to admit it doesn't

1127
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,980
hit me the way it hits some people now I

1128
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,619
I will say Mr Hill says you do not like

1129
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:53,039
purples at all and in fact you agree

1130
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:54,960
it's all chickweed asking I mean it's

1131
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:59,159
good it's good to have strong opinions I

1132
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:03,300
suppose you know but I said Mr Mendo

1133
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:05,578
perps but you know Urkel is Urkel for me

1134
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,619
like I have this weird relationship with

1135
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,119
with Urkel and that whole round of

1136
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,280
purples because

1137
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,720
at least in Cal I don't know you know

1138
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,839
where high and Lonesome is but at least

1139
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,919
in California it completely changed the

1140
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,400
weed game

1141
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:23,460
yeah and what I mean by that is before

1142
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,858
like Urkel and Mendo p and granddaddy

1143
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,740
purple and that like purple craze of

1144
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:31,440
like 040506 that kind of hit

1145
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:33,059
yeah any good weed you grew generally

1146
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,780
speaking salt

1147
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:39,119
yeah yep and I feel like the Urkel and

1148
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,500
the purple wave was the very beginning

1149
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,619
of like

1150
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,358
Brokers being like do you have this I'll

1151
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,220
take as much of it as you've got and if

1152
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,559
you don't I don't give a [ __ ] I don't

1153
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:51,419
want whatever it is I didn't want to

1154
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:52,739
grow Oracle I liked it but I didn't want

1155
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,900
to grow it but that's what they were

1156
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:56,219
asking for yeah and there was a bunch of

1157
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,800
people that were like hey man I'm having

1158
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:00,779
a hard time moving my stuff and you're

1159
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,900
like well if I give you this cut they'll

1160
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:07,440
take every bit of it yeah and that kind

1161
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,200
of started the movement of like Brokers

1162
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,358
want this so I'm going to grow this

1163
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,639
where I think I think everybody probably

1164
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:18,598
on this call would agree like before

1165
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:22,019
2004 if you grew Fireweed it was just

1166
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:24,599
going to go yeah it was it was gonna go

1167
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:27,539
it was gonna have a home and then like

1168
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,280
the name game with really started with

1169
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:31,338
purple craze and with Urkel and then it

1170
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,980
went to diesels and it went to cushions

1171
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:36,838
yeah but and a lot of those old strings

1172
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,719
like we were just talking train wreck

1173
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:40,920
Green Crack you know Blue Dream you know

1174
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:43,858
all these different things started

1175
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,318
getting lost to the Wayside

1176
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:49,440
um because they weren't as easy to move

1177
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,579
as whatever was dominant in the scene at

1178
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,519
the moment

1179
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:55,740
yep and we're playing that game yeah and

1180
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:58,559
that's what ended up making them rare

1181
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:00,899
you know like it's crazy that it's

1182
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,759
awesome that pack loved train wreck and

1183
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,639
blue dream enough to hold on to the real

1184
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,900
ones yeah it is you know very thankful

1185
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:08,699
for it

1186
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,579
um and most of my collection is just

1187
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:14,039
stuff that I personally liked so I held

1188
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:15,539
on to it you know or you know in high

1189
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,639
lonesome's case it's like that's really

1190
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:20,219
what preservation needs is like

1191
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,739
different groups being like these Cuts I

1192
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:24,239
really enjoy yeah and so I'm gonna hold

1193
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:26,699
on to them and I'm gonna grow them nice

1194
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,279
regardless of what the market is telling

1195
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:30,779
me because I care about them I mean that

1196
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,819
that that's the dividing line between

1197
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,819
Chase and a dollar and doing it for the

1198
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:37,259
love of what you're doing right you when

1199
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:39,420
you when you

1200
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,680
when you hold on to a cut long enough it

1201
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,858
becomes

1202
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:45,059
a a partner of yours right like I always

1203
00:46:43,858 --> 00:46:46,500
say a train wrecks the longest

1204
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:48,719
relationship I've ever had with a girl

1205
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,400
oh yeah man I say the same thing about

1206
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,799
the Maui because I popped it when I was

1207
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,300
18. yeah you know what I mean you grow

1208
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,980
up with these things right and they

1209
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,780
become this intimate part of your life

1210
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,818
regardless of if people accept it or not

1211
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,800
if it's if it's in your

1212
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,000
Zone and it's what you want then it

1213
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,680
really doesn't matter if it comes or

1214
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,940
goes right I mean it there there was

1215
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,419
years we're trying to work with just one

1216
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,380
plant in the corner yeah

1217
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,000
monocropping it for you know the whole

1218
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,858
25 years I've had it or however long

1219
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,719
it's been but you know she's she's

1220
00:47:13,858 --> 00:47:17,279
always always kept that special place in

1221
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:18,659
my heart and you know I've been around

1222
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,619
long enough I'm not the oldest guy in

1223
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:20,759
the world but I've been around long

1224
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,099
enough to know that if you wait long

1225
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,720
enough [ __ ] comes back around man um and

1226
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:26,579
you and you learn by watching others

1227
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:28,098
never hand your [ __ ] over to a tissue

1228
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:30,539
culture guy

1229
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:32,460
the other the other thing I think is

1230
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,980
that interesting about what we're

1231
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,500
talking about is that all these Elites

1232
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,679
that we're talking about from back then

1233
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,659
came about in a time when Elites only

1234
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:43,739
got popular if enough people like to

1235
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,858
smoke them

1236
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:49,199
yeah like this was an ERA where there

1237
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:51,900
was no modern weed marketing there was

1238
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:54,598
no hype machine yet like things got

1239
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,940
hyped because people enjoyed growing

1240
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,318
them yeah and a lot of people had to

1241
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,119
enjoy growing them for them to become

1242
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,920
popular and not everyone had to like it

1243
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:04,380
but enough of the community had to like

1244
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,059
it for it to be desirable otherwise it

1245
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,920
just kind of would fall by the way so I

1246
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:09,900
you know I had my Clockwork Orange cut

1247
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,780
in San Diego and down there it sold

1248
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,460
really well it sold really well but I

1249
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,560
was really stingy with it and I did not

1250
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:19,019
like passing it out and those who had it

1251
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,119
I made sure they didn't pass it out

1252
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,739
because it didn't get a lot of exposure

1253
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,420
you cannot

1254
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:25,799
back then you couldn't convince people

1255
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,960
that a strain was good unless they got

1256
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,818
to smoke it it just it was very hard to

1257
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,800
do and you couldn't force that

1258
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:33,179
artificial height it was very very hard

1259
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,818
to have artificial hype during those

1260
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:37,679
days and even really good if it didn't

1261
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:40,259
make it around it just didn't that's

1262
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:42,899
what happened you know it just if it was

1263
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,400
if it was listed as as a 50 eighth in

1264
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,318
the back page of High Times over in

1265
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,900
Missouri then it got some air time right

1266
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,420
yeah

1267
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:53,519
is that is on the internet probably in

1268
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,559
like in the forums during like high-end

1269
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,380
lonesomes like you know Heyday on the

1270
00:48:55,559 --> 00:49:01,019
forums I I think like the dog what

1271
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,900
people call the chem 91 now was probably

1272
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:06,358
more popular than it was in California

1273
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:08,519
because oh yeah my friend that passed it

1274
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:09,900
out to the three or four people that got

1275
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,139
it he wouldn't let us give it out

1276
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,880
anywhere and so for the most part

1277
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:18,838
um Brokers were like well how good can

1278
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,640
it be if I don't have it yeah yeah I

1279
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:23,179
think the forums is where the hype

1280
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,639
machine kind of got going absolutely

1281
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:29,219
you'd have somebody piss you know an OG

1282
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,259
Kush thread showing some pictures

1283
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:32,459
talking about their cut

1284
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,200
you know they're talking about what it

1285
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,179
goes for in California and it would just

1286
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:37,879
look killer and you know people would go

1287
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:41,219
ape [ __ ] over it

1288
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,900
and that's kind of where it all started

1289
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:45,899
um then you know people start arguing

1290
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,240
over strange and you know it's it's

1291
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,420
gotten us to where we are today I mean

1292
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:54,118
the lupus headband I remember that being

1293
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,680
one like that name starting to get

1294
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,980
attacked

1295
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:01,259
yeah well you know people started

1296
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,599
um getting their names attached to cuts

1297
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:06,900
that they didn't create and they didn't

1298
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,539
pop they just you know they were the the

1299
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,660
one on the Forum to let it out the

1300
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:15,000
people so it was now

1301
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:17,039
yeah so now it's it's their cut that's

1302
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,679
their name attached to it and that you

1303
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:22,800
know that still goes on today you know

1304
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,539
like oh yeah yeah I mean we better kick

1305
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,579
you better kick up royalties to some of

1306
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:27,960
these [ __ ] well I think I do

1307
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:30,839
think there's I do think there's a

1308
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,460
difference between like your name gets

1309
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:34,679
attached to something because people are

1310
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,420
trying to differentiate which one it is

1311
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:38,699
and they're saying comes from this

1312
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:41,400
person yeah there were certainly some

1313
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:44,519
people early on

1314
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,680
um like Lumpa or you know uh Ken from

1315
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:49,679
Ken's GDP or something like that where

1316
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:53,098
they intentionally attached their name

1317
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:55,558
for control yeah sure yeah

1318
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:56,940
you know and some people didn't attach

1319
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,440
their name for control it's just like

1320
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:00,599
other it's almost like other your

1321
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,539
friends give you a nickname it's like

1322
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,000
people on The Forum started referring to

1323
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:07,739
things as a certain cut yeah and it's

1324
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,019
sort of just organically happened where

1325
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:12,058
other people were like no I'm going to

1326
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:14,759
attach my name to it

1327
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,859
yeah and therefore I need credit or I

1328
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,800
need money or I need seeds or all the

1329
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:21,900
little dynamics that developed around

1330
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,400
possession and what's funny is is I

1331
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,380
can't think of a single person that

1332
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,139
intentionally attached their name to a

1333
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:32,119
cut that was actually the originator of

1334
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:32,118
the cut made the seeds or popped it

1335
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:40,139
um let me think about that uh

1336
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:42,599
what about Strawberry Cough

1337
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:45,118
oh that's a tough one because I I don't

1338
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,119
know did he pop the seed no you got to

1339
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,858
give it to him yeah yeah you know

1340
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,660
nothing against homie or anything like

1341
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:54,598
that but like obviously like the the

1342
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:56,279
camera one got skunked it got skunk the

1343
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,099
A's name attached to it because he was

1344
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,319
the first person talking on the forums

1345
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,059
um the three people I remember that

1346
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,699
intentionally attached their name was

1347
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:09,359
like AJ attached his name to sour

1348
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:11,159
can attached his name to GDP and Lumpa

1349
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,920
attached his name to headband

1350
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:15,358
uh all very Choice people yes you can

1351
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,858
all hate me for it or whatever but I I

1352
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:18,719
think those three at least like they

1353
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:21,058
intentionally added their own name oh no

1354
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,699
yeah yeah for sure yeah I think AJ was

1355
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:24,859
just the latest of the game on that one

1356
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:27,000
I never

1357
00:52:24,858 --> 00:52:28,858
heard of that cut

1358
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,559
um I took a little break from being

1359
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:34,920
online and you know any of any of the

1360
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:37,559
Forum stuff and I got back on uh about

1361
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,659
when I got onto IG and started hearing

1362
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,640
about AJ's hour and it's like man I've

1363
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:44,098
never heard of this one you know and it

1364
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:45,960
just you know there's so many things

1365
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:48,359
that are like that that you know I never

1366
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,460
heard of that cut I never heard of this

1367
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:53,519
sauerkraut I love the choco but you're

1368
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:55,679
welcome for that you're welcome yeah let

1369
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,059
me just let me just point out let me

1370
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,098
just point out it used to not be a

1371
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:03,720
popular thing to put yourself out there

1372
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:05,338
in this game yeah one time no yeah I

1373
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:07,858
tried you know pack I try to make that

1374
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:10,019
point all the time where it's like the

1375
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:11,900
skill sets that kept us safe for a long

1376
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:15,960
time which is kind of being invisible

1377
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:18,000
and keeping your head down uh you know a

1378
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,358
lot of us were indoctrinated into that

1379
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,940
lifestyle for 10 15 20 years and then

1380
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,880
all of a sudden in like 2012 or 2015

1381
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,400
people start putting their faces onto

1382
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,780
things yeah yeah and that it never

1383
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,940
really happened before and it went

1384
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,579
against a lot of the and then people

1385
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,900
started associating you know like you

1386
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,640
know burner with cookie or something

1387
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,680
like that like where it was like the

1388
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:44,039
person that was the most vocal

1389
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:46,199
ends up being like the the expert or the

1390
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,838
person that's like the most in charge of

1391
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:51,598
whatever the strain is it must be an

1392
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:53,400
official on the subject

1393
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,380
I mean what's what's funny about that

1394
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,180
too is that I've had bunch of talks with

1395
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,358
CSI

1396
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:02,818
um Urkel I would say probably blue dream

1397
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:06,139
and train wreck they all kind of have

1398
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:08,338
very mysterious Origins yeah

1399
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:11,578
there's a lot of cuts out there that

1400
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:14,818
like I there's a general consensus on

1401
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:18,300
most events that led to a Cuts creation

1402
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:20,460
and the people involved to me

1403
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,380
I I've never I mean I've heard people

1404
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,199
claim it but I've never any of those

1405
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,579
three strains they popped up and who the

1406
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,739
hell made them and where the hell did

1407
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:33,180
they come from and still a mystery to me

1408
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:34,979
yeah all of them uh and let me let me

1409
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:38,460
point out you know that some of that

1410
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:40,318
might just be a of design

1411
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,240
yeah sure you know there's there's a

1412
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,759
bunch of old boys that that still grow

1413
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:45,959
that I have known over my lifetime they

1414
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,700
won't touch the internet and they could

1415
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,159
care less about having anything to do

1416
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:51,480
with anything but doing what they you

1417
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,239
know keep on keeping on girl on the way

1418
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:57,960
they have yeah yeah

1419
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:59,578
yeah and scammers love that because it

1420
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,159
doesn't give them competition to the

1421
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:03,780
origin story very true like all of a

1422
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:07,139
sudden you can be like Urkel came from

1423
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,400
my farm this year I did this and there's

1424
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:10,980
not going to be anyone that's going to

1425
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,420
compete it you know a monk showed up on

1426
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,639
my property and just happened to bless

1427
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,559
us with this with this cut or whatever

1428
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:19,500
you know yeah that was almost like the

1429
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,240
canasta's GDP store and at some point I

1430
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,400
got to cut in because people are going

1431
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:25,078
to want to hear the Canasta story hnl

1432
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,000
they're going to want to hear it

1433
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,220
yeah and I'm gonna I got something I got

1434
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,219
a couple questions myself exactly see

1435
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:35,699
it's perfect time to bring it in

1436
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:37,919
so and Estes story

1437
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:40,439
from your point of view how did it go

1438
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,300
down you remember

1439
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,300
uh well I mean you're the one that

1440
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:48,539
tipped me off to it so

1441
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:52,380
I was the signal Ben you were I was kind

1442
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:55,739
of uh I was kind of in the process of

1443
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,780
stepping away from the forums up and all

1444
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:59,098
that but I still checked in every once

1445
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,440
in a while and you know mostly

1446
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,519
communicated with you know some of some

1447
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,519
of my old friends on there

1448
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:09,479
um but one day you sent me a message

1449
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,300
kind of letting me know that

1450
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,358
um

1451
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:19,260
female Appalachia cut that he kept had

1452
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:21,179
been entered into what was it the major

1453
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,280
cup it was like a major cup like the

1454
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:26,279
High Times there's just barely doing

1455
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,760
cups yeah in the US yeah I think it was

1456
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,420
like the San Francisco whatever yeah

1457
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,280
um

1458
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:38,280
and evidently a cut had been taken from

1459
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:43,140
Bodie's mom room by I guess a helper

1460
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:45,359
yeah and uh somehow Ken got it and uh

1461
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:49,618
liked it enough that he renamed it day

1462
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:53,159
11 and entered it into the cup so he won

1463
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:56,818
the cup with that cut of Appalachia and

1464
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:58,139
to follow up on the success created a

1465
00:56:56,818 --> 00:57:01,199
seed line

1466
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:03,000
not even using the cut to the best of my

1467
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:06,899
knowledge yeah who knows

1468
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,780
uh from what I think I if if I'm not

1469
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:13,200
mistaken I think it was he had an Oogie

1470
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:15,180
Kush seed line and he crossed that to

1471
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,759
Green Crack and figured you know it'd be

1472
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:19,259
close enough

1473
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,079
and that was

1474
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,579
um that was what came out as day 11 and

1475
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,059
I remember it being a you know a big

1476
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:29,700
deal people yeah this isn't what that

1477
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:32,519
was you know drastically different

1478
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:35,699
yeah so you know you kind of hit me off

1479
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:37,800
for that story on I see mag and I

1480
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:41,399
remember you know engaging in some

1481
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,500
conversations about it uh I was shocked

1482
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,039
that they admitted it

1483
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:49,440
yeah like you know normally that I was

1484
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,179
kind of how that goes down yeah like

1485
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,220
normally that stuff stays wrapped up

1486
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:55,679
yeah you know

1487
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:58,078
but yeah

1488
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,358
yeah so that was um

1489
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,000
it would have been cool to you know have

1490
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:04,759
won a cup with the name yeah right like

1491
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,440
yeah

1492
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,240
it was still when cups mattered like at

1493
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,500
that time there was it wasn't like fully

1494
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:12,598
bastardized to where there were

1495
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,940
thousands of Cups you know hundreds of

1496
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,619
Cups a year it was it was when cups

1497
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,260
winning a cup could mean the difference

1498
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,539
between a thriving business or not you

1499
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,760
know yeah and it really pushed Ken's

1500
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,440
business I mean most people already knew

1501
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,300
who Ken was from GDP because he had

1502
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,639
marketed himself with that but the cup

1503
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,500
win boosted the sales for that bay 11

1504
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:34,500
and his whole company and Seed launch

1505
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:37,260
massively that was why I was like this

1506
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:40,019
is [ __ ] gross and even the GDP thing

1507
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:42,660
with Ken is is pretty suspect oh yeah it

1508
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:44,460
is it's completely resistant I mean I I

1509
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:46,019
you know I don't tell this story very

1510
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,298
much and I'll have to be kind of like

1511
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:52,259
I'll have to circumvent around certain

1512
00:58:48,298 --> 00:58:53,880
parts of it I suppose uh because uh the

1513
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,460
person that I'm gonna talk about is like

1514
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,780
a total Anarchist Outlaw like we were

1515
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,298
just mentioning who would never want

1516
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,579
their name to be known yeah

1517
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:07,139
um but that person

1518
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:10,798
um is who can out the GDP from yeah up

1519
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:13,739
in my up in my neck of the woods and she

1520
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:16,500
it actually came from a retiring Vietnam

1521
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:19,139
vet who lived up in the hills by me in

1522
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:22,559
the Laytonville area and

1523
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:28,039
um my friend was uh pretty and female

1524
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:29,660
which was pretty rare in cannabis uh

1525
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:31,920
but

1526
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:34,558
especially as pack will know especially

1527
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,380
in the Humboldt or Mendo Hills this is

1528
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,819
even rarer

1529
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,680
for a person to like own their own

1530
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:42,838
properties and be doing their own things

1531
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:45,239
or whatever else it was pretty rare back

1532
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:47,039
then so yeah she was kind of gung-ho

1533
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:49,500
about it and he was kind of sweet on her

1534
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:54,179
a little bit and so he ended up giving

1535
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:56,358
her like I don't know 50 or 80 seeds of

1536
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:59,578
um of his own hybrids that he had made

1537
00:59:56,358 --> 01:00:02,338
and she found GDP in the first batch

1538
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:05,220
that she followed and the only reason I

1539
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:08,159
figured that out really was because

1540
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:11,519
um I helped her build like a a 60

1541
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:14,519
lighter in the woods oh wow and so

1542
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:16,380
um I knew her before she knew Ken and

1543
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:18,119
she gave it to Ken because they were

1544
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,059
Partners together on this thing right

1545
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:23,818
and she wanted to stay totally Anonymous

1546
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:26,220
okay yeah and people don't realize this

1547
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:28,500
about but this is sort of like the era

1548
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:31,078
where like the first real dispensaries

1549
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,420
were opening up in the bay yeah um

1550
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,740
places like yeah like the like you

1551
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,700
probably remember pack like the third

1552
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:39,899
floor

1553
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:42,118
oh yeah you know um and stuff and uh

1554
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,579
what was the other one uh The Vapor Room

1555
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,619
The Vapor Room the third floor

1556
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:48,839
um there was a few of them uh not very

1557
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:49,980
many back then the power exchange I

1558
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:52,019
believe was one you would always talk

1559
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,400
about that was the one that Matt that

1560
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:56,460
you were a little bit more familiar with

1561
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,980
but be that as it may

1562
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,960
um Ken was willing she wanted to stay up

1563
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,480
in the hills and stay anonymous

1564
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,960
right yeah and he was willing to go to

1565
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:10,679
the bay and Market it

1566
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:13,920
and so it kind of became TDP and there

1567
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:15,838
was and there was no she was fine with

1568
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,760
it because the last thing on earth she

1569
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,639
wanted to do was attach her name or show

1570
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,680
her face she had Outdoors yeah attention

1571
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,298
she was under the radar she had a she

1572
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,098
had you know you know 60 lighter was a

1573
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:28,139
big deal back then it was a diesel thing

1574
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:31,400
in the woods she wanted to stay

1575
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:31,400
completely hidden

1576
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,338
and that's kind of why Ken's story

1577
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,579
changes

1578
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:40,980
because he heard it second hand

1579
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:44,160
yeah that story and and if people want

1580
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:45,780
to hear the full story from the the

1581
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,598
werewolf's mouth

1582
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:52,559
it is uh there you can go on Google and

1583
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,760
if you look up Ken's GDP story I forgot

1584
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,040
what the name of the thing is but it's

1585
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,980
some like rapper guy interviewing Ken

1586
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:00,779
about it and he tells this real mumbly

1587
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,639
story and you can still find the

1588
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,920
transcript that I wrote online if you

1589
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:07,440
look for it and I actually transcribed

1590
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,818
it because it's a little screwy until

1591
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,519
you transcribe and actually see what

1592
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:15,179
he's saying but he says that Native

1593
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:17,358
American like shamans thought he was a

1594
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:20,759
really great white dude and helped them

1595
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:23,460
and all right that's all right yeah yeah

1596
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,799
right and um decided that he they were

1597
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:29,039
gonna gift him this magical purple

1598
01:02:25,798 --> 01:02:30,179
Vietnamese skunk plant wow that's where

1599
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,019
this came from

1600
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:37,139
so what's interesting about that is that

1601
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:41,338
the story goes is that the guy that gave

1602
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:44,699
my friend the seeds was a Vietnam vet

1603
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:46,798
and had brought back some uh seeds from

1604
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:50,159
his adventures over there when he was in

1605
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:52,739
the Army right and he it's basically

1606
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:54,179
like as you know it basically became

1607
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:56,639
hillweed

1608
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:57,960
right where he took the sativa and he

1609
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,298
started Crossing into some of the

1610
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,059
indicas that started coming in into the

1611
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:05,280
Mendo Humboldt area and trying to get a

1612
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:06,960
plant that would finish

1613
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,760
and then it sort of became that thing

1614
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,559
where it's like it was like on that hill

1615
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,940
and in that neighborhood or whatever it

1616
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,920
was like they were running this thing

1617
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:15,480
and people had different versions it

1618
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,380
makes sense you know

1619
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:21,000
um and it was unnamed and you know and

1620
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,400
when she popped him or whatever there

1621
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,699
was still a variety of like sativa to

1622
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,500
Indica leaning ones and they always pick

1623
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:30,058
for the outdoor they always picked a

1624
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,460
little bit more of the sativa leaners

1625
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,960
because they needed the stretch yeah and

1626
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:36,720
they didn't want much of the moldy

1627
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:41,039
density probably too but a little two

1628
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:42,199
three foot chunky plant for uh for a you

1629
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,739
know a

1630
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:49,078
Woods indoor situation was perfect yeah

1631
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:51,659
yeah especially in the early 2000s and

1632
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:53,640
the way that people grew back then you

1633
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:54,899
know a whole bunch of a whole carpet of

1634
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:57,000
plants that were only two and a half

1635
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:00,298
three feet tall and chunked out was a

1636
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,480
great look yeah perfect

1637
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:06,420
um and but yeah he you know he he he got

1638
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:09,059
that exact cut from her

1639
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:11,099
and nobody even knows who she is that's

1640
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:13,319
crazy

1641
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:15,359
I was just going to say a Vietnam vet

1642
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:16,619
jump from a Vietnam vet to a Native

1643
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,380
American trauma that's not the biggest

1644
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:21,180
leap huh yeah I mean you know addition

1645
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:23,338
here in addition there who's counting

1646
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:25,139
well I mean what's funny pack is like

1647
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:28,318
you know with you living up in Humboldt

1648
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:30,598
obviously it's it's not like the the

1649
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:32,699
natives up there have like a super high

1650
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:36,500
opinion of like you know random white

1651
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:40,759
dudes like Ken you know yeah

1652
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,760
right man we're in Vegas

1653
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:50,579
different places in Mendo like there's a

1654
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:52,619
lot of resentment yeah absolutely white

1655
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:55,920
people did not treat the natives that

1656
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:58,920
were living in The Valleys very well

1657
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,318
um but yeah he basically he had to make

1658
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:04,200
up a story and whenever you make up a

1659
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:07,139
story sometimes the details change you

1660
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:08,879
know okay so yes or no not so I'll ask

1661
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:15,259
you since you're from the area

1662
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:15,260
Ken Estes yes or no Mark Emery Mini

1663
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:21,000
no

1664
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,539
uh only because

1665
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,760
um

1666
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:26,279
you know uh

1667
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,500
you know I he just

1668
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:31,200
he basically like there was it was more

1669
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:34,460
than just kidding but like huh you're

1670
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,598
welcome oh man

1671
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,099
but he just you know he just took it

1672
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,539
down to the third floor and it was like

1673
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:41,160
he was one of those guys that was

1674
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:43,500
willing to there was not that many

1675
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:45,058
people from Mendo and Humboldt that were

1676
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,659
willing to go into those dispensaries

1677
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:51,720
and funnel weed into them yeah yep

1678
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:54,118
people wanted to be anonymous and he was

1679
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,219
willing to be not anonymous

1680
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,619
and as a result of that he got his name

1681
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:01,879
attached yeah there's also a really good

1682
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:05,640
song on YouTube called leave Ken alone

1683
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:07,318
oh man really oh it is so good I forgot

1684
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:10,679
who the rapper is in it but it's all

1685
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:12,980
about Ken getting popped and leave him

1686
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:15,838
alone and it's it's so good

1687
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:16,980
I highly recommend it

1688
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,838
huh

1689
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,719
description

1690
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:24,058
in maybe in maybe Ken's defense just

1691
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:25,919
just a little bit because I think this

1692
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:27,480
you could apply this to almost anyone

1693
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,000
that uh

1694
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,740
um gets famous around weed is they get

1695
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,480
famous and they get known for a

1696
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:35,939
particular story

1697
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,159
and then it's like it becomes more of

1698
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:39,240
maintaining their image than being

1699
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,118
honest

1700
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:44,159
sure yeah I think that temptation is a

1701
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:45,838
really big Temptation and we could talk

1702
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:47,219
about lots of different people in the

1703
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:48,779
industry where

1704
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:52,199
you know there's like not very

1705
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,640
well-known details that are true but you

1706
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:56,279
know they have a narrative and they have

1707
01:06:53,639 --> 01:07:00,139
a public Persona and their interest is

1708
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:03,059
maintaining that public persona

1709
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:05,159
yeah I mean I I saw this in the UFO

1710
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:07,440
World a lot too where people would be

1711
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:08,759
like famous for let's say they claim to

1712
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,280
have an abduction

1713
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,200
or a UFO sighting and they get a lot of

1714
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,880
Acclaim for this and maybe they did see

1715
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:16,318
something they found to be anonymous

1716
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,079
maybe these were they're being totally

1717
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:21,119
true are honest at the time but after

1718
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:23,700
that attention goes away and all the

1719
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,858
Adoration and admiration from people and

1720
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:27,000
the you're so cool this is you and the

1721
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:30,239
recognition

1722
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,858
they slowly get this one need to get

1723
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:34,259
those endorphins or whatever it is again

1724
01:07:31,858 --> 01:07:36,838
the admiration flowing so they'll make

1725
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:40,079
it up they'll they'll force it they'll

1726
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:41,639
force that whatever it is and take that

1727
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,680
reputation shot and I see that in weed

1728
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,900
it transfers over so well I mean some

1729
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:47,098
people catch lightning in a bottle once

1730
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,200
and they spend the rest of their life

1731
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:51,720
like trying to just chasing that Dragon

1732
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,118
yeah force that hype and it just looks

1733
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:56,578
better that's a thirsty ego is what that

1734
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:59,338
is or people make entire seed companies

1735
01:07:56,579 --> 01:08:01,798
just based around the one or two things

1736
01:07:59,338 --> 01:08:03,599
that they're famous for and only do

1737
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:05,159
variations around those things because

1738
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,338
that's what they're known for

1739
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:10,379
yeah sure all right it's super common I

1740
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:11,880
mean you know you were talking we I

1741

I mean I heard you know wasn't there

1745
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:24,259
rumors that like the e32 was because it

crew

1751
01:08:36,198 --> 01:08:41,759
but I remember that

1752
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,739
um you know that term coming out on the

1753
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,479
forums and it was like no you don't have

1754
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:49,019
train wreck if you have the arcade to

1755
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:52,979
cut the e32 cut is the one I remember

1756
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:54,900
Calio Calio is a part of the e32 it was

1757
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:57,059
like an early dhk type thing

1758
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:58,318
I don't know I don't know I know one

1759
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:00,359
person who'd know I kind of bug him

1760
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,620
about that and ask but yeah I was trying

1761
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,140
to remember because I know it was that

1762
01:09:01,619 --> 01:09:05,818
was it Berkeley patience group that Eric

1763
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,759
worked out of

1764
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:09,980
yeah

1765
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:12,659
that was his name on the forums like

1766
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:14,278
a-e-r-i-c no it was the arcade uh

1767
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:15,960
whatever that dispensary was it opened

1768
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:18,299
up I think that's right it wasn't

1769
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,640
Berkeley you're right yeah BPG was

1770
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:21,899
different yeah yeah like 11 there was a

1771
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,640
club like one of the first clubs that

1772
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:25,738
opened up in Arcata was off of 11th

1773
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,900
Street and uh apparently right dude or

1774
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:30,119
you know yeah and so there was a Calio

1775
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:33,838
story from him and then there was the um

1776
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:36,778
train wreck and it does predate him yeah

1777
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:39,778
but he he is the cut that goes around is

1778
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:41,819
from him if I remember correctly and I'm

1779
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:45,600
sure someone will correct me if I get

1780
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:47,279
that wrong but uh yeah the e32 yeah the

1781
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,560
cut that goes around that everybody has

1782
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,299
came by him and was passed out by that

1783
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:54,360
Collective

1784
01:09:51,298 --> 01:09:56,819
not the 100 original and nobody has it

1785
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:59,819
yeah not the right I mean cry baby cry

1786
01:09:56,819 --> 01:10:01,259
baby it was pretty extensively he's done

1787
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:03,479
his research there I think you're right

1788
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,739
it sounds like what he was saying yeah

1789
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:06,539
yeah he knows that story about these

1790
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:07,919
I've never seen the e32 cut though I

1791
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:10,500
mean I haven't put it up against the one

1792
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,359
that I've held on to but um I don't know

1793
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,100
do you do you guys I think it's that cut

1794
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:16,439
I think it's the same cut I think it's

1795
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:20,100
okay yeah I've never seen it I've just

1796
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:23,519
you know seen the Forum hype about

1797
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:25,620
yeah I'm pretty sure it was out of there

1798
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,199
from Eric I'm pretty sure that's the one

1799
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:29,719
that everybody has or that has it now or

1800
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:33,119
that had it back then

1801
01:10:29,719 --> 01:10:36,899
that's hard I don't know that's the one

1802
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:38,340
that CSI has then yes well I will tell

1803
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:40,859
you that I'll tell you that my cut

1804
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:42,840
didn't come from him directly I got my

1805
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:45,359
cut from the boys up in the hill so

1806
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,860
here's the story right come 2000 uh you

1807
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:48,479
know we're all into clones and we're not

1808
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:52,079
popping seeds and

1809
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:56,039
uh my my roommate uh partner at the time

1810
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:57,479
uh knew this girl in Arcata and uh she

1811
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:59,100
was real uh you know a cute little kid

1812
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:00,658
or whatever you know kind of ditzy and

1813
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,280
whatnot and he asked her for some cuts

1814
01:11:00,658 --> 01:11:04,679
and she's like sure you know someone's

1815
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:06,920
helping me she runs up into the hills I

1816
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:10,260
want to say it was up in Kneeland area

1817
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:12,179
and I got got a flat of tdub he brought

1818
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:14,579
it down and didn't tell them that she

1819
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:16,560
wasn't getting it for her own re-up yeah

1820
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:17,819
she ended up giving it to us right and

1821
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,380
that was my first introduction to the

1822
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:22,019
plant I hadn't even seen it prior to

1823
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:23,880
that in in the Years a couple years

1824
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,560
before that and so we're growing this

1825
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:28,140
thing and then come come to find out

1826
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,520
she's getting hawked by these cats all

1827
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,760
of a sudden because she wasn't supposed

1828
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:35,100
to let that [ __ ] thing out and that's

1829
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,420
exactly the same time that Arcata we

1830
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,159
didn't call it arcade turmeric then but

1831
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:39,840
started getting really prolific and

1832
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:41,759
Arcadia and it was blocking everywhere

1833
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,159
it's just you couldn't get away from it

1834
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,900
yeah um and then not too long you know

1835
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:48,179
two three years into that all of a

1836
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:49,920
sudden people were bringing their Cuts

1837
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:52,440
in and bringing their their work in and

1838
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,539
it was you know rare you know you get 10

1839
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:56,819
people line it up and it was rare that

1840
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:58,560
you got that original uh you know Planet

1841
01:11:56,819 --> 01:12:00,840
cut from that point that's I think

1842
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,280
because of like the tuxed lines the wood

1843
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,140
horse seedlines I finally got a hold of

1844
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:05,819
a wood horse we can talk to him finally

1845
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:08,460
for an interview which would be cool I

1846
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:09,539
think um yeah he was responsible for a

1847
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:11,658
lot of the train wreck out there that

1848
01:12:09,539 --> 01:12:15,539
head seat remember grateful Head HML

1849
01:12:11,658 --> 01:12:17,698
yeah he did um Oriental Express I think

1850
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:20,340
yeah yep yep

1851
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:21,178
um but who

1852
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,239
um

1853
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:27,600
God who else did something with it billy

1854
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:28,738
goat yeah yeah he did he didn't really I

1855
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,239
know he at least did the Oriental

1856
01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:32,279
Express too you could do a public

1857
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,439
service announcement uh don't name your

1858
01:12:32,279 --> 01:12:35,479
seed line after a famous cut

1859
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:37,919
s

1860
01:12:35,479 --> 01:12:39,899
please don't please pick a different

1861
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,719
name this is why we have never seen the

1862
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:44,420
same sfv OG cut after swerve released

1863
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:47,158
that line

1864
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:49,920
don't name it don't name it the exact

1865
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:52,198
cut name please God or Larry or Tahoe

1866
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,060
they're all kind of just like up in the

1867
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:55,738
air on if you ever see those cuts again

1868
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,480
that they'll ever be anything like they

1869
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:59,759
were originally because so many seeds

1870
01:12:57,479 --> 01:13:02,399
were sold under those exact names you

1871
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,340
know yeah yeah it makes it makes it hard

1872
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:07,319
you know and uh yeah yeah and I will say

1873
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:10,380
that the Santa Cruz wreck is not from

1874
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:11,359
Santa Cruz by the way yeah

1875
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:14,279
yeah

1876
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:16,139
but that that's super common too I mean

1877
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:18,000
Matt and I were chatting about that like

1878
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,260
if you got snow and Humboldt it was

1879
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,079
humble snow

1880
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:24,420
yeah it was Oregon snow if you got a new

1881
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,039
Gene it was Eugene snow or if you got it

1882
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,079
in Bakersfield there's Bakersfield snow

1883
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:29,119
because that's oh yeah that's a

1884
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:32,219
different things

1885
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,599
and then you know people would get it

1886
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:35,158
and they would change the name and they

1887
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:39,480
would bring it to different places and

1888
01:13:35,158 --> 01:13:43,019
like names have always been very uh very

1889
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:45,000
odd part of the history yeah

1890
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:47,760
you know I found out about a local

1891
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,380
strain here that I never heard of

1892
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,719
um it's actually a city in the mountains

1893
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:53,640
45 minutes from here but it's it's very

1894
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:55,679
close and it's called the Tehachapi

1895
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:58,500
Terror and I found it in a magazine from

1896
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,840
the 70s and I know nothing else about it

1897
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:05,698
but yeah it sounded so cool it had to be

1898
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:08,760
Terror some backseat mash up yeah I mean

1899
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:10,500
mashup was a Garb it doesn't attack do

1900
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,780
you or to Matt does anybody know like

1901
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,238
what is the blue dream origin story

1902
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:17,399
since we've gone over like not knowing

1903
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:20,459
what train wreck is what is

1904
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:23,219
blue dreams supposed to be I've heard

1905
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,198
I've heard a few different theories

1906
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:28,198
hi and Lonesome what do you got

1907
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:30,059
Adam Blue Dream wasn't in my world

1908
01:14:28,198 --> 01:14:32,039
um we were we had green crack and try

1909
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:34,800
interact Blue Dream wasn't as big out

1910
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:36,479
here that only stuff us off you know was

1911
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,719
flown in

1912
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:41,879
so so that specific cut when it was

1913
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:44,819
first given to me by Bodhi

1914
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:47,100
and the people who kind of were around

1915
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:48,599
the Santa Cruz area that knew the the

1916
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,440
crowd that was giving it out or where it

1917
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:54,480
came from all said it was

1918
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,339
98 blueberry from DJ that specific cut

1919
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,139
that he would pass around crossed a

1920
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:59,100
super specifically a super silver haze

1921
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:02,940
from Greenhouse

1922
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:05,340
and I only know of one company that ever

1923
01:15:02,939 --> 01:15:07,379
released that specific cross

1924
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,179
and I don't know if it came after or

1925
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,980
before

1926
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:13,619
those things chicken before the egg and

1927
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:16,859
it was the blue hen from um

1928
01:15:13,619 --> 01:15:18,300
Bluegrass seeds Kentucky some seeds

1929
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:20,279
something like that yeah it was a blue

1930
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:22,440
hand and I remember seeing pictures of

1931
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:25,079
both in the candle Bible so I'm not sure

1932
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:26,519
which came first on that but they were

1933
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:28,198
both similar type plants that I'd

1934
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:30,719
imagine you could find similar

1935
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:33,059
Expressions uh if they were both using

1936
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:35,340
similar lines to make them I would

1937
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,560
imagine you know the only variation I

1938
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,840
would add to that that I've heard is

1939
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:41,880
um

1940
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,980
this uh Haze that people refer to as the

1941
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:47,039
Santa Cruz Haze

1942
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:48,658
being being that cut that was uh used

1943
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:50,819
with the blueberry

1944
01:15:48,658 --> 01:15:52,738
um I have yet to see

1945
01:15:50,819 --> 01:15:56,219
the Santa Cruz Haze I don't know if this

1946
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:58,379
is just a myth or if it's I would I

1947
01:15:56,219 --> 01:16:00,239
would almost bet my left nut that it

1948
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:03,119
would be a super silver haze based on

1949
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:05,218
the the terp profile and everything else

1950
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:06,539
I would be pretty pretty dead on

1951
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:08,760
especially because how quickly it

1952
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,859
finishes still all that yeah

1953
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:14,760
yeah

1954
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:17,000
the Johnny Blaze I think was uh

1955
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:20,039
yeah it was Legend seeds Neville's Hayes

1956
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,679
yeah that one took a little bit longer

1957
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:24,179
and it still got kind of big like

1958
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:26,279
Neville's

1959
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:29,819
um I could definitely see super super

1960
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:32,219
Hayes being the father pack I remember

1961
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:33,779
if I remember correctly I think Super

1962
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:38,279
Silver Haze

1963
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:41,939
got dropped as a seed line in 97.

1964
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:43,319
mm-hmm I think it won three cups in a

1965
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:48,119
row

1966
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:51,059
in in uh in the Cannabis cups in Holland

1967
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:52,559
um and I believe it was like 97 98 99

1968
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,480
something like that it could be wrong

1969
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,140
maybe it was 96 but it was something

1970
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:59,399
along those lines I think you're right

1971
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:01,320
right around there it was right around

1972
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:04,259
there that's right yeah I think about

1973
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:07,920
like old song super Haze cut like if I

1974
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:09,600
cross that to the DJ's cut DJ's Mama

1975
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,760
blueberry that he sold when he was going

1976
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,440
around giving lectures and stuff if I

1977
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,600
cross those two I'm pretty sure I could

1978
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:18,719
nail that thing pretty fast it would it

1979
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:21,300
would be pretty regular occurring

1980
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,340
yeah pretty sure so yeah I I could see

1981
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,679
how that could be definitely

1982
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:27,179
one thing one thing I'll interject is

1983
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,140
that at the little gathering that we

1984
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:30,658
just had

1985
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:34,140
um one of the favorite things I smoked

1986
01:17:30,658 --> 01:17:36,859
was uh a hybrid pack made that was uh

1987
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:39,659
Blue Dream by train wreck oh that's good

1988
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:41,698
so good one of the one of the things

1989
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:44,759
I'll say about it is that I think

1990
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:48,178
terpenoline has a lot of depth to it but

1991
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:52,320
it's so forward and strong like all it

1992
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:54,899
overpowers a lot of people and that blue

1993
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:57,599
dream hybrid with train wreck that blue

1994
01:17:54,899 --> 01:18:00,839
dream brought like a Sweetness in that

1995
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:04,860
almost like took like the the edge off

1996
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,779
that train wreck flavor oh yeah but like

1997
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:08,579
but the the flavor of train wreck was

1998
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:10,800
still there it just wasn't like the

1999
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:12,899
predominant knock you just took a step

2000
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,520
back right yeah took a step back there

2001
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:16,799
was like a sweet it's almost like with

2002
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,420
cooking where like you add some acidity

2003
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,760
or you add some you know you add

2004
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:23,760
something to balance out your sauce

2005
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,760
and

2006
01:18:27,658 --> 01:18:31,979
um you know uh we joke a lot that like

2007
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,719
once you get to a paneling in something

2008
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:37,079
it's really [ __ ] hard to get it out

2009
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:40,319
yeah um yeah and I didn't think anything

2010
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:41,880
could tame uh the train wreck nose so

2011
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:44,698
much

2012
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:46,679
um but that hybrid it really allowed the

2013
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:49,259
terpenoline to shine

2014
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:51,179
because it gave it a sweetness I

2015
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:54,119
actually did a review on the blue dream

2016
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:55,619
train wreck in a previous episode in a

2017
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:58,319
short episode so go check that out if

2018
01:18:55,619 --> 01:19:00,059
you're interested but yeah it I I was I

2019
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:01,979
was really impressed because it was two

2020
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:04,980
very two things I was very familiar with

2021
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:06,718
and they combined really nicely yeah

2022
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:08,339
that yeah I think that surprised a lot

2023
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,899
of people and may have been I think

2024
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,920
other than the blue dream I think that

2025
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:14,899
was probably the one that everybody

2026
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,899
gravitated to pretty hard yeah

2027
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:20,779
yeah but he still did it it's luck with

2028
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:20,779
intention

2029
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:31,500
I think everybody did they're like yeah

2030
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:33,059
so that that's that's kind of the

2031
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,859
impression that that that's kind of the

2032
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:38,100
impression that it made where I just had

2033
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:40,920
to say that uh two old school you know

2034
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:43,380
pretty famous things uh that crossed

2035
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,060
really well together yeah yep yeah you

2036
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,679
know the one thing that I that I I

2037
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,480
appreciate that not so by the way but

2038
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:50,579
all you guys appreciate the you know

2039
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,559
your input with that I want to say that

2040
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:54,000
the thing that I was struck most with

2041
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,340
was

2042
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,800
um not not just t-dub taking a back step

2043
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:01,260
but then the train wreck comes through

2044
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,480
and pushes up the potency a little bit

2045
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,860
right oh yeah oh yeah you know both of

2046
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:06,119
those in and of themselves if you don't

2047
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:07,319
if you're not used to smoking them and

2048
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:08,880
your body's not used to taking it in

2049
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:10,439
they can both hit you pretty hard in

2050
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,179
their own way yeah

2051
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:14,399
um but it's it was it's nice to be able

2052
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:16,679
to smoke both of the original parents

2053
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:18,960
side by side and then go over and hit

2054
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:20,760
hit that combination and see where it

2055
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,980
kind of got and a hamster got pulled

2056
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,119
back

2057
01:20:21,979 --> 01:20:26,158
so it was really it was really a cool

2058
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,198
treat to be able to watch my buddies you

2059
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,879
know and partake with my friends in

2060
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:31,979
terms of looking at that in real time

2061
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,600
and uh getting that feedback you know

2062
01:20:31,979 --> 01:20:36,419
it's really like any special thing to do

2063
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:39,960
that anytime you smoke like 60 things in

2064
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:42,000
two and a half days uh yeah it gets even

2065
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,500
even just smelling things you smell five

2066
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,600
or six things in a row and you're like

2067
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,340
your nostrils are kind of burned out for

2068
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,400
10 minutes but

2069
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,619
um the quality of that that hybrid shown

2070
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:54,119
in my opinion while we're talking about

2071
01:20:52,619 --> 01:20:55,859
this stuff let's talk about some of the

2072
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:57,599
the stuff we saw at the party and some

2073
01:20:55,859 --> 01:21:00,719
of the different things that we uh

2074
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,520
noticed didn't notice I mean um packet

2075
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,960
was your first time there all right

2076
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,360
unless it was your first time coming to

2077
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,980
the one of the Gatherings so um yeah

2078
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:09,539
maybe maybe you guys uh I don't know

2079
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:11,639
which one he wants to start but talk

2080
01:21:09,539 --> 01:21:13,500
about some of the strains you saw what

2081
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:16,199
you thought was the most unique what you

2082
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:18,359
thought uh probably bummed you out the

2083
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:20,599
most and yeah all that

2084
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:22,259
ha hmm sure

2085
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,300
you know

2086
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:26,579
as we were just talking about it pox

2087
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,079
stuff surprised me

2088
01:21:26,579 --> 01:21:30,779
um you know

2089
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:33,300
and that that one in particular

2090
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:35,460
um just how the train wreck came through

2091
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:38,400
on some of his hybrids it took a back

2092
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:41,100
seat I've grown quite a few hybrids of

2093
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:43,259
training Rapids normally A variation on

2094
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:46,140
the theme you know it's it's train wreck

2095
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:48,480
with a tiny bit of this or a tiny bit of

2096
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:50,280
that but you know his hybrid seemed

2097
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:52,799
really well Blended that one in

2098
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:53,759
particular I really enjoyed

2099
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,900
um

2100
01:21:53,760 --> 01:22:01,500
uh bitters grow of Shoreline was oh yeah

2101
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:06,198
oh that was amazing that was great um

2102
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:09,899
and his um dog [ __ ] uh Electric Boogaloo

2103
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:11,279
yes sir both of those were great

2104
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:13,619
um

2105
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:15,719
it was just a lot

2106
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:18,899
um another one that really stood out to

2107
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:20,698
me was the Death Star yeah several

2108
01:22:18,899 --> 01:22:23,099
people you know Panda brought some local

2109
01:22:20,698 --> 01:22:27,899
brats um

2110
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:29,820
and that had such a it was a lot uh

2111
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:33,179
ranker than I thought it'd be it almost

2112
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:36,899
had like a Kim D rankness to it yeah

2113
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:39,060
that was you know in that level as far

2114
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:41,460
as potency I would say but it was like

2115
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:43,880
definitely instead of being like that

2116
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:46,279
nasty garbage it was like nasty

2117
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:50,100
polyester

2118
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:51,960
it's hard to say but it was just it was

2119
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:55,140
it's very complex

2120
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:59,219
very bright and

2121
01:22:55,140 --> 01:23:00,140
it's pretty [ __ ] hard yeah I dug it

2122
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:03,119
yeah

2123
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:05,280
so definitely it's a it's Unique

2124
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:07,198
absolutely unique

2125
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,698
how about you pack what'd you see it

2126
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:10,979
stood out

2127
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:12,899
man I mean there's there's so much

2128
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:15,119
novelty going around that it's hard to

2129
01:23:12,899 --> 01:23:17,759
kind of determine some from the others I

2130
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:19,859
was blown away by the cob just for the

2131
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,600
fact yeah three year old cob sitting

2132
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:23,579
there and uh you know Bodie brought that

2133
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,780
through those that was pretty amazing I

2134
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:27,658
wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat it

2135
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:30,479
or smoke it so I just smoke Oh I thought

2136
01:23:27,658 --> 01:23:32,759
we were supposed to boof it yeah well

2137
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:34,678
you can you can you can and let me know

2138
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,900
how that goes Bodhi told me who made it

2139
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:38,158
so I just stuck it up my my ass yeah I

2140
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:41,039
think that's probably what made you sick

2141
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:42,420
yeah it probably was I probably knew

2142
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:44,819
what I was going to do with it and

2143
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:47,420
poisoned it you know what I do with

2144
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:47,420
everything I get

2145
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:54,539
um you know I mean honestly

2146
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:57,659
it's you know jumped in before I could

2147
01:23:54,539 --> 01:24:00,119
speak but um you know the the Electric

2148
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:02,399
Boogaloo amazing you know what I mean

2149
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:04,260
and yeah and I'll tell you what uh that

2150
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:05,219
Shoreline brought me back to my days in

2151
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:08,280
high school

2152
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:12,000
oh yeah you know I just felt like yeah

2153
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:14,099
man I felt like it was 93 all over again

2154
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,619
it's a time capsule man that's a great

2155
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:18,420
one Absolutely I'll look so forward to

2156
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:21,179
Growing that too by the way so

2157
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,980
um but uh you know one that one that

2158
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:24,960
threw me off guard that I wouldn't have

2159
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:27,599
gone and picked up

2160
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,100
um on my own but happened to hit it and

2161
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,600
it and somehow or another it cut through

2162
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,679
everything for me at that moment I got

2163
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,179
so high

2164
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,619
I remember watching this kid just

2165
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:36,840
laughing at me looking at me like David

2166
01:24:34,619 --> 01:24:38,158
you're stuck right now was that uh was

2167
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,860
that Moon boat

2168
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:42,658
oh really

2169
01:24:39,859 --> 01:24:44,099
that was good it was good [ __ ] yeah he

2170
01:24:42,658 --> 01:24:46,259
brought and you know it could have been

2171
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:47,940
that I was on the you know 25th hour of

2172
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:49,980
the day yeah it might have been it's

2173
01:24:47,939 --> 01:24:51,059
four in the morning you know whatever I

2174
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:52,500
don't remember the time I don't remember

2175
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:54,780
where I was but I remember hitting that

2176
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:56,939
and just kind of floating off into this

2177
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:58,380
like other place for a while and uh

2178
01:24:56,939 --> 01:25:00,119
feeling embarrassed because you know

2179
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:02,279
someone was laughing at me at my

2180
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:04,380
reaction I liked it enough to put a

2181
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:06,359
picture up of it on Instagram and post

2182
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:07,980
about it so it was it was pretty good

2183
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:10,019
yeah it was really good it was exciting

2184
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:11,519
I mean I've gone I've gone and Revisited

2185
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:12,960
it since because you know I was lucky

2186
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,159
enough to be able to bring some party

2187
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,439
bags back

2188
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:17,759
and you know it's really not that bad uh

2189
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:19,559
it's not something that I would

2190
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,780
necessarily have in my Armory you know

2191
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:24,539
in terms of I want to grow this and and

2192
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:26,880
get into it but I I'm right you know I

2193
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:29,939
might do that if I had the right cut but

2194
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,859
um that one stood out uh you know uh our

2195

2226
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:46,159
ridiculous stuff across the board

2227
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,579

01:26:54,658 --> 01:26:59,759
um and and some of the magic that he

2232
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:02,579
weaves uh our friend panda came down

2233
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,400
from way up North with an Arctic uh made

2234
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:07,500
the trip down and I think uh another

2235
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:10,738
friend of our ring our friend of our

2236
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:12,600
friends that grew out the Meteora for it

2237
01:27:10,738 --> 01:27:15,539
yeah that was good yeah and brought that

2238
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:18,659
down and then um somebody had the uh

2239
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:20,639
what is the Bo the burnt offering next

2240
01:27:18,658 --> 01:27:23,819
to that which is I guess a grandchild of

2241
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,560
the uh Meteora and it was nice to have

2242
01:27:23,819 --> 01:27:27,779
those side by side because

2243
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:29,580
um you know just smoking that for an

2244
01:27:27,779 --> 01:27:31,439
offering a couple months back

2245
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:34,139
um I was like wow this is very unique

2246
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:36,599
this is not something you usually get

2247
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:39,480
um often and uh having that next to the

2248
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:41,340
media or forward seeing that kind of uh

2249
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:42,539
relation between the two those that was

2250
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:44,100
pretty interesting for me to be able to

2251
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:46,319
get to do that so that definitely sticks

2252
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:48,239
out in my mind meteor four was probably

2253
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,460
my favorite like uh what would be

2254
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:53,519
traditionally considered sativa leaning

2255
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:54,600
type there yeah my favorite out of all

2256
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,219
of them

2257
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,079
in that category

2258
01:27:56,219 --> 01:28:01,560
what about you not so what about you

2259
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:04,859
Matt what not to go ahead I'm gonna take

2260
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:06,900
a different tact I think in that uh my

2261
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:07,880
favorite part of the Gathering was the

2262
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:11,179
people

2263
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:14,039
and the the reason I say that is because

2264
01:28:11,179 --> 01:28:15,960
you know when when we threw these

2265
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:17,880
parties earlier they were kind of based

2266
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,800
around the emerald cup

2267
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,260
um it was sort of like a way for heads

2268
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:25,039
and and friends to gather after the sort

2269
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:27,300
of like the big the big Gathering itself

2270
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:29,279
uh and this time was different and then

2271
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:31,320
it was intentional

2272
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:35,039
um and it was friends that mostly talk

2273
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:37,619
online to each other coming from in some

2274
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:39,840
cases literally all over America yeah

2275
01:28:37,619 --> 01:28:42,059
coming from the Far East from the far

2276
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,679
north from you know people spent a lot

2277
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,880
of time and energy to make sure that

2278
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,158
they could come

2279
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,840
and you know I really there's no joke

2280
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:50,279
getting it it was no joke once they hit

2281
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,920
the airport to get to where the party

2282
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:54,719
was but yeah yeah yeah and I do think

2283
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,100
that like you know especially with covid

2284
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,020
and stuff and people being trapped in

2285
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,579
their houses and being able to spend a

2286
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:02,760
lot of time online you can make some

2287
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:05,460
really good friends but I do think it

2288
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:06,960
really helps to spend a few days like

2289
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:09,060
breaking bread with someone getting

2290
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:12,899
baked with them eating food shooting the

2291
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:14,460
[ __ ] I mean cornhole one of my I mean

2292
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:16,198
one of my one of my favorites you know

2293
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:18,000
I'm not so loved in you know yeah yeah

2294
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:20,579
one of my favorite things about the

2295
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,979
event is that you know our our homie

2296
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:24,960
who's uh bitter uh you know he gets up

2297
01:29:22,979 --> 01:29:27,479
at like 4 30 in the [ __ ] morning or

2298
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,039
something so he starts tough and

2299
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:31,559
whenever I go to one of these events I

2300
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:34,939
wake up and I just hear his laugh yeah

2301
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:37,139
that's great you know because

2302
01:29:34,939 --> 01:29:38,579
shout out to Bitter and his wife for

2303
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:41,039
holding it down by the way there was

2304
01:29:38,579 --> 01:29:42,539
this there was this memory I had where I

2305
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:45,359
got up in the morning

2306
01:29:42,539 --> 01:29:46,738
and uh bitter was on like his like 12th

2307
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:49,439
joint or something because he was a

2308
01:29:46,738 --> 01:29:51,959
little tent on trying all this [ __ ] and

2309
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:53,698
high and Lonesome had just woke up and

2310
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,698
bitter handed him this joint it was like

2311
01:29:53,698 --> 01:29:59,279
a chemd joint laced with uh Kim D Keith

2312
01:29:56,698 --> 01:30:00,899
yeah and high and Lonesome took two

2313
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:04,698
three hits and he was like man this is

2314
01:30:00,899 --> 01:30:08,899
like this is not the starter mix

2315
01:30:04,698 --> 01:30:08,899
he went back to bed after that actually

2316
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:14,519
and so just but but you know faces to

2317
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:16,439
names hearing people's voices getting to

2318
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,500
see people's sense of humor where it's

2319
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:21,178
not typed out but it's in real time

2320
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,920
um you know the internet is cool because

2321
01:30:21,179 --> 01:30:26,699
it brings it can bring people together

2322
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:29,579
but being able to spend time

2323
01:30:26,698 --> 01:30:31,439
I think and just it was a it's like a

2324
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:34,679
pro it was a proper to me like old

2325
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:36,960
school Harvest Festival yeah where you

2326
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:39,420
have a bunch of real weed people sitting

2327
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:42,420
down making friends talking shop eating

2328
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:45,060
food joking sharing their passion

2329
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:46,800
basically you know

2330
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:48,719
um and that you know there was enough of

2331
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,239
us there that each brought some of our

2332
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:53,939
old favorites uh that there was a lot of

2333
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:55,439
good favorites there yeah I remember I

2334
01:30:53,939 --> 01:30:57,119
can't remember who it was it was like

2335
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:58,439
I'm not gonna call them out because that

2336
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:00,960
would be rude or anything like that but

2337
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:03,178
I remember Panda telling me that one of

2338
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,600
the guys that came brought like all this

2339
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:09,000
like new school Za you know yeah and

2340
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,800
after he smoked the shoreline and the

2341
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,960
Electric Boogaloo and some Trenton some

2342
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,579
this and that he like took all his weed

2343
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:18,179
and he put it back in the bag because he

2344
01:31:14,579 --> 01:31:20,399
was like man you know I don't even care

2345
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:23,158
about my weed he's like this right here

2346
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:25,679
yeah and it's neat because you know

2347
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:27,299
we're all older now or whatever and we

2348
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,760
don't realize that stuff that we have a

2349
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:31,619
lot of experience with most new school

2350
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:35,400
smokers that have only been around for

2351
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:37,019
eight or ten years missed the era of

2352
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:40,698
almost everything that all four of us

2353
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:40,699
have been talking about this entire time

2354
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:46,079
in like 2010 2012 if you kind of got

2355
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:48,119
into the scene in the last 10 or 15

2356
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:49,559
years

2357
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:51,359
um you probably didn't smoke real train

2358
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:54,719

2371
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:30,480
well even even on that you know like so

2372
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:34,020
I'm in the kitchen and you know CSI and

2373
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:35,759
Bodhi and H L are all talking

2376
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:42,539

since the early to mid 2000s yeah yeah

2380
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,980
and it was probably the first time they

2381
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:55,158
met in person

2382
01:32:52,979 --> 01:32:58,019
yep sure was yeah

2383
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:59,698
you know so even that that kind of stuff

2384
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:01,199
right there I just think is super cool I

2385
01:32:59,698 --> 01:33:04,519
mean me and H no have a company together

2386

and that was the first time we've met

2387
01:33:04,939 --> 01:33:09,479
I remember I was like all all frantic

2388
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:12,139
because I came in the door because I was

2389
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:15,359
the last one there and like

2390
01:33:12,139 --> 01:33:17,699
yeah I was driving in the canyon I can't

2391
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:19,979
see for [ __ ] it was super dark so it was

2392
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:21,779
taking forever so I finally get there

2393
01:33:19,979 --> 01:33:24,299
and we brought had to bring the dog

2394
01:33:21,779 --> 01:33:25,800
because it was big and wild nobody else

2395
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,900
gonna take care of him and I had to

2396
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:30,840
carry in like three rooms of [ __ ] just

2397
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:33,119
for the dog and so I am dead tired and I

2398
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,199
remember walking by hugging someone I

2399
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:35,399
thought was Panda because I've seen

2400
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:37,500
pictures of panda but I'd never met

2401
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:39,299
Panda hugging I'm thinking I hug Panda

2402

people in their 30s people in their 60s

2422
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,219
you know where a lot of a lot of times

2423
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:42,719
you're really only hanging out with like

2424
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:46,380
your own age group

2425
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:49,198
and we had people there from their

2426
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:53,039
mid-20s all the way up to their mid 60s

2427
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:55,439
yeah yeah it was probably a 40-year you

2428
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:57,179
know I mean probably like you know uh

2429
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:59,460
Denali and his late you know there was

2430
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:01,079
there was some senior citizens there

2431
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:04,260
there were some kids that were in our

2432
01:35:01,079 --> 01:35:06,960
opinion or barely out of their diapers

2433
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:08,460
um you know and and I remember you know

2434
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,639
and some that are barely in their

2435
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:13,198
diapers yeah I remember Panda looking

2436
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:14,760
over at me and being like dude I've

2437
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:16,579
never been to anything like this in my

2438
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:18,960
life

2439
01:35:16,579 --> 01:35:20,158
yeah to be able to soak people out like

2440
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,899
that is one of the coolest things on

2441
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:24,179
earth and you know I know I think I

2442
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:25,799
think I stopped Matt once at one point

2443
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:27,480
and I looked at him and said dude this

2444
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:31,500
is one of those moments in time that's

2445
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:33,479
quite rare uh to come across so

2446
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,679
um don't you know just recognize I

2447
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:37,198
wasn't telling them to recognize but I

2448
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:39,239
reckon I'm right yeah I agree with you I

2449
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:42,479
just think people taking their time and

2450
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:44,579
their energy and money and flying and

2451
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:46,678
driving and prepping and all the effort

2452
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:50,158
that went in to just have a nice time

2453
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:53,880
with friends for a weekend and talk shop

2454
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:56,460
um you know I can't I felt High honestly

2455
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:57,659
like for days afterwards and it wasn't

2456
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,939
yeah

2457
01:35:57,658 --> 01:36:01,379
it was just I just enjoyed myself

2458
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:03,960
immensely

2459
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:07,440
there's a lot of positive intention for

2460
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:09,960
being yeah that was pretty cool and uh

2461
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:12,359
you know I think uh I think that kind of

2462
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,319
like bonding with people in person is

2463
01:36:12,359 --> 01:36:16,198
important

2464
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:18,420
yeah uh Brynn has never been to one of

2465
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:20,099
our Gatherings before my chick and she

2466
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:23,158
went this time and like when we got home

2467
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:25,139
she's like I finally get it I finally

2468
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:26,638
get how you bonded with these guys and

2469
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:28,199
like why you guys love each other as

2470
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:30,480
much as you do and why you guys are so

2471
01:36:28,198 --> 01:36:32,339
loyal and close she's like I love those

2472
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:35,879
dudes now too I feel like they're family

2473
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:37,500
yeah so yeah you know I can tell she's

2474
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:41,480
not in the room because she didn't throw

2475
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:41,479
a shoe at you yeah exactly

2476
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,479
hey man I'll tell you what dude the one

2477
01:36:46,859 --> 01:36:50,339
thing I want to say about that is you

2478
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:52,019
know the the world that I was brought

2479
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:54,060
into because I didn't grow up in the

2480
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:55,739
weed scene I I jumped into you know

2481
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:58,020
Junior High High School kind of thing

2482
01:36:55,738 --> 01:37:00,419
but the the old cats that I that brought

2483
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:02,699
me in under their wings that was the

2484
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:04,619
energy and that was the philosophy you

2485
01:37:02,698 --> 01:37:06,000
know what I mean it was you know there

2486
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:07,500
were people with egos of course and

2487
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,300
there's people you know snazzles out

2488
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,198
there and whatnot but for the for the

2489
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,119
most part

2490
01:37:10,198 --> 01:37:14,339
there was this cultural like

2491
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:15,779
consideration in this this bigger

2492
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:18,360
picture that was going on besides the

2493
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:20,519
plant the plant brings you together but

2494
01:37:18,359 --> 01:37:22,920
there's a certain way you know of of

2495
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:25,500
kind of interacting with people that

2496
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:28,380
that really kind of solidified that era

2497
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:30,238
for me and to be able to fast forward 20

2498
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:33,239
some odd years and get a touch of that

2499
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:35,819
you know a tasted that again in a very

2500
01:37:33,238 --> 01:37:38,099
unique kind of situation uh you know

2501
01:37:35,819 --> 01:37:40,619
kind of brought back some some uh

2502
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:42,060
some Hope on my behalf right because I'm

2503
01:37:40,619 --> 01:37:44,039
watching everything else fall out I'm

2504
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:45,960
not joining the big the big I guess I'm

2505
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:48,119
not riding the wave or at this point I'm

2506
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,500
not and it's not my thing but

2507
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:51,539
um to know that that was still well and

2508
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,158
alive and all we had to do was uh

2509
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:55,260
you know kind of let it all fold

2510
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:57,719
naturally and get there you know yeah

2511
01:37:55,260 --> 01:38:00,239
yeah I mean there were a lot of a lot of

2512
01:37:57,719 --> 01:38:03,060
young guys like not to said you know a

2513
01:38:00,238 --> 01:38:05,638
huge age Gap but you know we're all weed

2514
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:08,820
people we're all you know very much

2515
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:11,880
similar yeah we're in it

2516
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:14,759
um great to see I've tried to drive home

2517
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:16,859
like in our our Discord patreon to like

2518
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,360
the the people that hang out there and

2519
01:38:16,859 --> 01:38:20,099
the Breeders syndicate with us and talk

2520
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:22,019
stuff and like get really into the nerdy

2521
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,579
end of stuff is like when they hear us

2522
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:25,020
talk about the can Illuminati they like

2523
01:38:23,579 --> 01:38:27,059
you know they they kind of first you're

2524
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:29,100
like yeah is it like some underground

2525
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:30,960
like you know they don't realize like it

2526
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:32,579
was named as kind of like a a

2527
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,500
tongue-in-cheek joke just because it was

2528
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:36,420
like it wasn't anybody who gives a [ __ ]

2529
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:38,219
it wasn't any of the the famous people

2530
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:39,840
that you'd see in cannabis like as the

2531
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:41,819
main faces you didn't see Snoop Dogg

2532
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,679
there you wouldn't see sure been you

2533
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:46,380
wouldn't see any of those guys there

2534
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,539
um but what you did have was the most

2535
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:50,520
passionate people in cannabis I felt

2536
01:38:48,539 --> 01:38:51,960
like I that's all it's ever been about

2537
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,120
has nothing to do with how long you've

2538
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:56,158
been doing it has nothing to me nothing

2539
01:38:54,119 --> 01:38:58,260
to do with how good you are at doing it

2540
01:38:56,158 --> 01:39:00,299
not even that it has to do with your

2541
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:02,100
passion your drive and like how intent

2542
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,960
you are to to make this your your

2543
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:06,500
passion really I think that's how we all

2544
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,500
found each other

2545
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:11,879
yeah for sure it's pretty it's pretty

2546
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:13,319
cool you could be on the same level as a

2547
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,480
brother you had never met from halfway

2548
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:16,859
across the world are you guys walk in

2549
01:39:15,479 --> 01:39:18,299
the door and it's as if you knew each

2550
01:39:16,859 --> 01:39:20,399
other your whole life you know yeah it's

2551
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:21,900
crazy man nothing better I definitely

2552
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:25,138
think it I definitely think it

2553
01:39:21,899 --> 01:39:27,779
strengthened some friendships you know

2554
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:29,400
um which is pretty cool and in the fact

2555
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:32,340
that it was pretty quick

2556
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:34,259
either way as far as the actual weed

2557
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:36,179
goes since I pontificated a bunch about

2558
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:39,600
like just like human as the human

2559
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:43,199
element you hit everybody it feels yeah

2560
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:46,560
I've been super clear that I think that

2561
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:50,158
the 90s and the early 2000s was sort of

2562
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,920
the golden era of weed and so most of my

2563
01:39:50,158 --> 01:39:55,679
favorites are things from that era yeah

2564
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:59,279
you know the chems the cushes the train

2565
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:02,880
wrecks the blue dreams the shoreline

2566
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:06,059
um for my for my age or whatever I just

2567
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,020
find most of that older weed hits me

2568
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:09,600
better

2569
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:11,699
yeah it gives me a better effect and

2570
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:15,120
even if it's a wide variety of effects

2571
01:40:11,698 --> 01:40:17,039
it's the rare weed that's been made in

2572
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:19,800
the last five or six years that hits me

2573
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:22,500
like some of that older stuff yeah and

2574
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:25,500
so having a bunch of friends bring their

2575
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:27,960
personal favorites you know uh you know

2576
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:30,420
we he mentioned it but bitter brought

2577
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:32,939
you know two three kind maybe four kinds

2578
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:35,600
of kush along with the Electric Boogaloo

2579
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:38,399
along with the shoreline and then

2580
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:40,500
high and Lonesome had some chemd and

2581
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:42,839
some and some headphones and then fire

2582
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:45,238
cam d by the way yeah and some and some

2583
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:47,639
different things and then you know a

2584
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:50,039
pack had uh you know train wreck and

2585
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:51,779
blue dream and classic the blue garlic

2586
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:54,779
train wreck was a big hit too people do

2587
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:56,399
yeah and um you know there was there was

2588
01:40:54,779 --> 01:40:59,340
a few different people that brought the

2589
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:01,198
the you know the Death Star and and just

2590
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:04,199
you know and just different things like

2591
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:06,178
that I mean uh you know it eventually

2592
01:41:04,198 --> 01:41:07,738
you know at first I was like oh I wonder

2593
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:09,179
if there's going to be enough weed and

2594
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:10,979
then I was like man I wonder if there's

2595
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:13,880
enough places to put all this weed

2596
01:41:10,979 --> 01:41:17,218
because like we kept moving table tops

2597
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:18,900
and all that and uh well nothing usually

2598
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:21,198
brings it all like like most of the

2599
01:41:18,899 --> 01:41:23,299
parties it's it's been like 90 percent

2600
01:41:21,198 --> 01:41:25,619
yeah yeah

2601
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:27,719
I'm not gonna be bringing a bunch of

2602
01:41:25,619 --> 01:41:28,819
stuff so we were he was concerned yeah

2603
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:31,380
yeah

2604
01:41:28,819 --> 01:41:33,599
it was that way because because I had

2605
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:36,179
greenhouses and stuff like that even if

2606
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:38,940
I'm like mono cropping say two things

2607
01:41:36,179 --> 01:41:41,279
for the market yeah I would have a 20 by

2608
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:43,678
30 bed that was a bunch of head stash

2609
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:45,300
yeah yeah sure and it was just me you

2610
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,340
know so the first two three parties we

2611
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:52,020
did I don't know Matt I probably brought

2612
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:54,000
pounds it was yeah I think like yeah it

2613
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:55,679
was like pounds of each individual thing

2614
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,479
I probably brought like you know there

2615
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,880
was probably like four or five pounds of

2616
01:41:57,479 --> 01:42:02,759
like you know total but it was like 35

2617
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:04,980
different things you know yeah uh no I

2618
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,780
think it was like one to two pounds of

2619
01:42:04,979 --> 01:42:08,779
like 35 different things yeah

2620
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,840
in a commercial environment just

2621
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:19,079
everyone sharing being super generous

2622
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:21,900
giving samples to all their friends you

2623
01:42:19,079 --> 01:42:24,479
know CSI uh you know dumped a bunch of

2624
01:42:21,899 --> 01:42:26,339
uh you know various crosses he'd made on

2625
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:29,218
the ground so that anyone could grab

2626
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:31,619
them up people were exchanging seeds and

2627
01:42:29,219 --> 01:42:33,359
information I think I should shout out

2628
01:42:31,618 --> 01:42:35,519
to I brought you know not everybody

2629
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:38,158
could do this because some people flew

2630
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:41,040
and didn't drive but yeah I brought some

2631
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:44,399
mementos from my past

2632
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:48,238
um Matt brought a bunch of very cool

2633
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:51,719
um magazines and old art and uh books

2634
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:53,879
you know rare rare um you know catalogs

2635
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:57,869
of different things for people to look

2636
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:59,960
through and no one stole anything

2637
01:42:57,869 --> 01:43:02,639
[Music]

2638
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:05,039
but that just I think I think ended up

2639
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:06,779
in my stuff yeah you're the only other

2640
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:09,359
person that brought books you know yeah

2641
01:43:06,779 --> 01:43:11,399
so it just ended up in my stuff but but

2642
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:14,819
just just a bunch of friends you know

2643
01:43:11,399 --> 01:43:17,519
cooking and eating out and and smoking

2644
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:20,099
things and chatting and all that it

2645
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,960
really does make a difference yeah well

2646
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:23,460
the vibe too right like it wasn't a

2647
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:25,560
competition it wasn't about who's got

2648
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:28,139
the biggest uh ego or the biggest issue

2649
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:30,179
it was you know really kind of this this

2650
01:43:28,139 --> 01:43:31,800
joining right like I took this out I

2651
01:43:30,179 --> 01:43:33,840
think that makes a difference too like

2652
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:35,460
honestly we've talked about like do we

2653
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,020
want to make it like a cup event we've

2654
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:39,060
talked about it a few times between a

2655
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:40,920
few of us and it's like I I don't know

2656
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:42,539
man would that change it like because

2657
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:45,179
even even though it's all really close

2658
01:43:42,539 --> 01:43:47,340
friends as men we're competitive you

2659
01:43:45,179 --> 01:43:50,179
know to a degree and if you have like a

2660
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:53,039
prize or something that we can all like

2661
01:43:50,179 --> 01:43:55,139
argue over like Flex on it even Flex on

2662
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:57,238
each other over it just changes the vibe

2663
01:43:55,139 --> 01:43:58,920
completely so I mean the hard thing too

2664
01:43:57,238 --> 01:44:01,079
is when you have a party like that with

2665
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:02,340
the way that weed works it's like a

2666
01:44:01,079 --> 01:44:04,260
snapshot in time

2667
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:05,639
yeah so there was thing there was

2668
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:07,860
friends of ours that couldn't come

2669
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:09,659
because of conflicts

2670
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:12,299
um there was weed that was almost done

2671
01:44:09,658 --> 01:44:14,099
that couldn't make it that was on the

2672
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:16,079
line you know but not quite ready to be

2673
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:18,300
in the bag so it was kind of like what

2674
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:20,219
do I have ready at the time yeah and

2675
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:22,440
some of it was a little fresh some of it

2676
01:44:20,219 --> 01:44:24,480
was a little old some of it was perfect

2677
01:44:22,439 --> 01:44:27,000
you know

2678
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:28,559
um but really what it was is it was

2679
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,479
mostly just like

2680
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,920
you know it's kind of like everybody

2681
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:33,359
brought stuff and it's like here's what

2682
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,279
I do for love

2683
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:38,099
and here's what I'm cropping right now

2684
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:40,380
to survive yeah and here's a variety of

2685
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:42,840
things that that incorporate all that

2686
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:45,239
you know I mean how better can it get

2687
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,860
man you know no it was I'm not I I mean

2688
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:48,000
the only thing my only complaint with it

2689
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:49,799
was that

2690
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,340
um it needed to be like an extra two

2691
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:57,380
days yeah for sure and I needed I needed

2692
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:57,380
like a humidifier and throat

2693
01:44:57,979 --> 01:45:02,279
uh we had it in a pretty we had it in a

2694
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:04,980
pretty dry mountainous part of

2695
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:08,158
California and with all the talking and

2696
01:45:04,979 --> 01:45:10,279
smoking I was like a husk yeah you

2697
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:13,679
sounded bad at the end of the day

2698
01:45:10,279 --> 01:45:15,719
you know I think all of us most people I

2699
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,460
talked to or heard their voice for three

2700
01:45:15,719 --> 01:45:19,560
or four days afterwards were in the same

2701
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:23,279
position yeah oh yeah it took a minute

2702
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:25,679
it took a minute to recover yeah shout

2703
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:27,599
out to cry baby he sent this and I'll

2704
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,940
I'll give a plug to the company too so

2705
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:31,320
nice this is that piece I brought it to

2706
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:33,379
the party and he sent it out so we could

2707
01:45:31,319 --> 01:45:36,179
use it at the party and to hook us up

2708
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:39,359
yeah it's a molten I think they say it's

2709
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:42,239
the g-y-z-r perk which it's just a few

2710
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:44,399
little holes but it's it's probably my

2711
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:46,138
favorite piece you don't get like crap

2712
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,059
all over the lip you know I don't know

2713
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:50,279
one of the coolest things and this is

2714
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:52,560
the tornado I think it's called the

2715
01:45:50,279 --> 01:45:54,899
tornado like ash catcher thingy whatever

2716
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,580
yeah that was the other cool part was

2717
01:45:54,899 --> 01:45:58,198
just I mean I brought up I brought a

2718
01:45:56,579 --> 01:46:01,198
tube and stuff but there was a bunch of

2719
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:04,138
different Vapes Joe you know not only

2720
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:06,539
that but just like smoking smoking the

2721
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:09,539
way people prefer to smoke yeah which

2722
01:46:06,539 --> 01:46:11,698
can vary widely yeah local local tried

2723
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:14,039
glass for his first time he had only

2724
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:16,319
ever smoked out of joints or blunts I'm

2725
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:18,479
like bro you have to try that and after

2726
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:20,579
that he was a changed man and then he

2727
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:22,919
trained and then he tried the rip and he

2728
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:25,139
was even more mind blown that that weed

2729
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:26,460
could taste like that you know yes well

2730
01:46:25,139 --> 01:46:29,699
it was funny with that old school

2731
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:32,219
[ __ ] Vape box uh yeah yeah and the

2732
01:46:29,698 --> 01:46:34,859
crew like that method that we figured

2733
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:36,899
out with it or whatever you know

2734
01:46:34,859 --> 01:46:39,179
um and and then you just and then what's

2735
01:46:36,899 --> 01:46:42,059
interesting about that is you smoke a

2736
01:46:39,179 --> 01:46:43,920
joint a blue dream or you or you've Vape

2737
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:46,080
blue dream or you take a bong hit of it

2738
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:49,380
and you get different qualities sure

2739
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:52,198
yeah yeah you know lots of it not so

2740
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:55,199
explain explain what that box was again

2741
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:57,618
oh man so the box it's like one of the

2742
01:46:55,198 --> 01:47:00,539
what's in the box not so it's awesome

2743
01:46:57,618 --> 01:47:02,819
it's probably like one of the older like

2744
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:04,500
Vape devices that came out it's probably

2745
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:06,539
been around for a good 20 years or

2746
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,880
longer it's been a long time and it's

2747
01:47:06,539 --> 01:47:10,560
basically a wrapping

2748
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,400
can you guys hear it oh I'm sorry hold

2749
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,400
on let me stop that

2750
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:17,698
we have an interesting house here likes

2751
01:47:15,658 --> 01:47:19,079
to make some noises hold up he's beating

2752
01:47:17,698 --> 01:47:22,500
off there it is

2753
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:25,198
and uh so it's like a wooden box that

2754
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:27,479
has like a glass uh element with a

2755
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:30,359
ceramic on it and you can dial it in for

2756
01:47:27,479 --> 01:47:33,779
how hot it gets and then it has like a a

2757
01:47:30,359 --> 01:47:35,759
glass mouthpiece with a a tube for lack

2758
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:37,979
of a better term that connects to

2759
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,659
another glass piece

2760
01:47:37,979 --> 01:47:42,479
um and most people would end up like

2761
01:47:39,658 --> 01:47:44,219
filling the glass like really deep yeah

2762
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:46,439
and then you get one or two nice hits

2763
01:47:44,219 --> 01:47:48,480
and then it kind of tastes popcorny and

2764
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:50,279
everything and it kind of loses its

2765
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:52,799
flavor and it's hard to deal with but we

2766
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:55,500
figured out 20 years ago is if you just

2767
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,300
grind up weed and you just you just use

2768
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:00,600
the mouthpiece and you just suck up a

2769
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:01,980
little bit just enough it's the motion

2770
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,860
looks like when you do it yeah can you

2771
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:05,819
do it you have to like Hoover yeah but

2772
01:48:04,859 --> 01:48:09,779
what do you do do you put it to your

2773
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:11,698
mouth I do you have to put it I smoke by

2774
01:48:09,779 --> 01:48:13,139
putting things to my mouth and inhaling

2775
01:48:11,698 --> 01:48:15,899
I don't know how other people do it but

2776
01:48:13,139 --> 01:48:18,659
that's my message okay uh I inhale if I

2777
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:20,519
can get you to pantomime and so I uh and

2778
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:22,979
so you know know if you but if you just

2779
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:25,139
coat the the screen with a little bit of

2780
01:48:22,979 --> 01:48:26,698
weed yeah you can get two or three

2781
01:48:25,139 --> 01:48:28,440
really nice hits and then you can blow

2782
01:48:26,698 --> 01:48:30,658
it out in a little bit of water or glass

2783
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:32,579
or something like that and it just is

2784
01:48:30,658 --> 01:48:34,379
really user friendly yeah that

2785
01:48:32,579 --> 01:48:39,319
completely changed my Rip Deck too now

2786
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:42,079
yeah we the vapewear box right yeah

2787
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:45,238
vapewears and Vapor brothers made um

2788
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:47,819
vapewear Vapor Brothers indeed and yeah

2789
01:48:45,238 --> 01:48:49,500
we smoked it a bunch and it kind of fell

2790
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:52,319
in and out of favor and then when we

2791
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:54,179
figured out how to do it that way

2792
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:57,380
there was like a couple year period

2793
01:48:54,179 --> 01:49:00,420
where like that was the method

2794
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:02,340
and you get really clean Terps that way

2795
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:04,319
you know you get really like a really

2796
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:06,420
good sense of like the profile of how

2797
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:08,099
the weed tastes I feel like it's a

2798
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:11,158
little bit of a different Buzz I think

2799
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:13,020
you get way higher in my opinion I at

2800
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:14,599
least it's it's it's a noticeably

2801
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:16,980
different High

2802
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:18,840
smoking any other way and I it's got to

2803
01:49:16,979 --> 01:49:20,698
be because like the volatile

2804
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:22,260
[ __ ] that would normally burn away right

2805
01:49:20,698 --> 01:49:24,059
away you're actually experiencing what

2806
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:25,980
it's like to you know and then the other

2807
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:29,100
thing I'll say is that since everyone

2808
01:49:25,979 --> 01:49:32,519
was so generous with samples I'm still

2809
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:34,920
smoking off samples I brought home

2810
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:37,980
um and I got a much better sense of a

2811
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:39,420
lot of the weed at home yeah sure I did

2812
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:42,000
at the party because when you're at the

2813
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:44,399
party once you've smoked 27 kinds of

2814
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,618
weed in eight hours through nine

2815
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:48,000
different methods you know you're just

2816
01:49:46,618 --> 01:49:49,679
looking for what cuts through at that

2817
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,658
point yeah it's like what cuts through

2818
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:53,639
but it's like you you know it's hard and

2819
01:49:51,658 --> 01:49:55,439
it's like then it's like I can wake up

2820
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:57,000
and I can do some chores and I can take

2821
01:49:55,439 --> 01:49:59,099
a couple hits of this and go do some

2822
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,979
stuff and I'll be like oh it does that

2823
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:03,539
yeah it's got that kind of effect you

2824
01:50:01,979 --> 01:50:05,459
know like oh it makes me want to sit

2825
01:50:03,539 --> 01:50:07,198
down and do nothing or like packs it

2826
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:10,139
with the train wreck oh like it makes me

2827
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:13,799
want to move yeah did any of you get to

2828
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:15,179
try the banana tie oh yeah that [ __ ]

2829
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:18,539
makes me want to move makes my heart

2830
01:50:15,179 --> 01:50:21,319
pound I love it I love it a bit much for

2831
01:50:18,539 --> 01:50:21,319
me all right

2832
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:29,520
that's the other part of it that I that

2833
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:31,139
I do like is that you know pack used to

2834
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,119
live up in Humboldt and I do think that

2835
01:50:31,139 --> 01:50:36,199
like Humboldt and Mendo and going to I

2836
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:39,599
call Santa Cruz like the very edge of

2837
01:50:36,198 --> 01:50:42,238
the weird bubble you know yeah there's

2838
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:44,520
this bubble that there's enough weed

2839
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:46,319
people doing stuff around you that

2840
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:49,500
there's somewhat of a community

2841
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:51,299
you know and we we got some friends that

2842
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:53,340
came out from Illinois and from Alaska

2843
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:54,960
and from here and from there that

2844
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:57,679
they're kind of like the only person

2845
01:50:54,960 --> 01:51:00,899
like them in their little Community yeah

2846
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:02,880
and so it was really it was really nice

2847
01:51:00,899 --> 01:51:04,379
to see especially some of the younger

2848
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,539
guys

2849
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:09,060
um get to hang out with a bunch of

2850
01:51:06,539 --> 01:51:11,219
people like them of all age groups

2851
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:12,300
I think probably for them it was like

2852
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:14,698
more

2853
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:18,179
memorable even for us

2854
01:51:14,698 --> 01:51:19,919
I'm sure yeah maybe I don't know I don't

2855
01:51:18,179 --> 01:51:22,020
know if memorable would be the correct

2856
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,219
term saying how we're all so high you're

2857
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:25,560
probably not going to retain a lot of

2858
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:28,020
them you know influential I don't know

2859
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:30,600
remember I remember a fishing hook

2860
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:31,940
almost hit me in the head a few times

2861
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:34,320
yeah yeah

2862
01:51:31,939 --> 01:51:36,000
and you know just just speaking of that

2863
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:37,799
bubble not so that you brought up I was

2864
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,539
telling it you know a while back you

2865
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,159
know one of the reasons why I didn't get

2866
01:51:39,539 --> 01:51:44,039
on the farm back in the days because I

2867
01:51:41,158 --> 01:51:46,738
you know I was in that network from you

2868
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:48,238
know or the network that I that I had

2869
01:51:46,738 --> 01:51:49,859
around me was you know it was kind of

2870
01:51:48,238 --> 01:51:51,419
compartmentalized right like there was

2871
01:51:49,859 --> 01:51:53,519
the cruise down in Big Sur and you had

2872
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:55,739
your Monterey cats Seaside gas and the

2873
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:57,239
injured people and you know Santa Cruz

2874
01:51:55,738 --> 01:52:00,299
and Humboldt

2875
01:51:57,238 --> 01:52:02,279
um but I I never had a need to go

2876
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:04,739
outside of whatever the network was that

2877
01:52:02,279 --> 01:52:06,719
I was working within in terms of trying

2878
01:52:04,738 --> 01:52:09,599
to reach out or find out you know what's

2879
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:11,939
going on with others or you know growing

2880
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:13,260
techniques or whatnot not that it wasn't

2881
01:52:11,939 --> 01:52:15,238
wouldn't have been something that would

2882
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:17,159
have been helpful at that point but

2883
01:52:15,238 --> 01:52:18,779
because of my propensity to not want to

2884
01:52:17,158 --> 01:52:20,519
be on the radar whatsoever and even

2885
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:21,599
touch a computer and say anything on

2886
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,679
there

2887
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,900
um that had anything to do with whatever

2888
01:52:22,679 --> 01:52:27,420
I wasn't really compelled at least in my

2889
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:28,859
group to have to you know feel like I

2890
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:30,179
need some connection outside of what I'm

2891
01:52:28,859 --> 01:52:32,939
doing on my own you know I wasn't really

2892
01:52:30,179 --> 01:52:34,980
that kind of Lone Wolf space whereas a

2893
01:52:32,939 --> 01:52:36,000
lot of people I think and HDL could

2894
01:52:34,979 --> 01:52:37,379
probably speak to us better than me but

2895
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,539
a lot of people who weren't so connected

2896
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:41,940
or had to be even more

2897
01:52:39,539 --> 01:52:43,560
um discreet right and weren't going to

2898
01:52:41,939 --> 01:52:45,000
talk to anybody it was like that was a

2899
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:46,739
great place to be able to make those

2900
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,560
connections and and really kind of

2901
01:52:46,738 --> 01:52:52,079
figure out what was going on right yeah

2902
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:53,820
here it was uh a whole different animal

2903
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:57,719
I mean you didn't

2904
01:52:53,819 --> 01:53:00,539
you knew two guys maybe in the area it

2905
01:52:57,719 --> 01:53:03,060
was you know if you wanted if you wanted

2906
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:04,920
to be amongst people like you you had to

2907
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:07,260
find them online because you weren't

2908
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:09,118
talking to other people around you doing

2909
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,900
the same thing weren't talking and it's

2910
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:13,139
still

2911
01:53:09,899 --> 01:53:15,719
uh still kind of like that here even

2912
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:18,659
with you know some version of

2913
01:53:15,719 --> 01:53:21,600
legalization it's um it's still pretty

2914
01:53:18,658 --> 01:53:22,859
pretty closed lip at least you know the

2915
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,639
people that have been doing it a long

2916
01:53:22,859 --> 01:53:27,359
time

2917
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:30,659
I agree and I also think that because

2918
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:33,899
we're sort of like a a very small subset

2919
01:53:30,658 --> 01:53:36,960
of a subculture right

2920
01:53:33,899 --> 01:53:38,638
um in a way like we love weed for weed

2921
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:41,219
you know

2922
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:43,560
um is that the either you know the

2923
01:53:41,219 --> 01:53:46,920
internet is a way for lots of people

2924
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:49,139
that have sort of unusual interests to

2925
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:50,639
find each other

2926
01:53:49,139 --> 01:53:52,500
right

2927
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:54,779
um you know from all kinds of walks of

2928
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:58,738
life if you know that or bathroom stalls

2929
01:53:54,779 --> 01:54:02,880
we only have two choices I mean and uh

2930
01:53:58,738 --> 01:54:03,859
you know so they uh how I got NASA's

2931
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:08,420
numbers

2932
01:54:03,859 --> 01:54:12,599
indeed right off the bathroom stall

2933
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:15,239
but yeah I mean I I I agree I you know

2934
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:16,739
it's it's that you know even in people

2935
01:54:15,238 --> 01:54:19,019
think

2936
01:54:16,738 --> 01:54:21,419
I get it all the time where people think

2937
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:24,060
that Mendo or Humboldt is something that

2938
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:25,618
it isn't yeah because they you know they

2939
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:28,199
think of it as like this weed Mecca

2940
01:54:25,618 --> 01:54:29,519
which it kind of is but it also has all

2941
01:54:28,198 --> 01:54:32,099
these elements that like you wouldn't

2942
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:36,000
really get unless you lived there

2943
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:38,280
um and so I but you know just you know

2944
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:41,520
sharing time and energy with like-minded

2945
01:54:38,279 --> 01:54:44,698
individuals I think is a good thing you

2946
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:47,040
know and I was I'd like pack I too I was

2947
01:54:44,698 --> 01:54:49,799
scared of the internet

2948
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:52,560
um especially when Heaven's stairway and

2949
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:55,320
uh and cannabis world and and overgrow

2950
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:58,080
all got shut down yeah I wasn't very

2951
01:54:55,319 --> 01:55:00,238
tech savvy so I got worried that like

2952
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:04,279
everything I did instead would be

2953
01:55:00,238 --> 01:55:06,178
permanently there that they could find

2954
01:55:04,279 --> 01:55:08,519
wasn't it

2955
01:55:06,179 --> 01:55:09,899
was a little bit it was kind of screen

2956
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:12,320
Merchant

2957
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:12,319
yeah

2958
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:17,460
like 1990 and this was like probably I

2959
01:55:15,779 --> 01:55:19,380
don't know I think those busts happened

2960
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:21,300
until like oh three or oh four if I

2961
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:23,880
remember correctly

2962
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:26,100
um but I didn't like when with high and

2963
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:30,659
Lonesome being on icmag and all that

2964
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:32,400
like I worked in that era uh but I just

2965
01:55:30,658 --> 01:55:35,579
basically like you were on someone

2966
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:38,219
else's computer yeah and I was I was in

2967
01:55:35,579 --> 01:55:40,979
Norco Lake County Mendo you know it was

2968
01:55:38,219 --> 01:55:43,739
kind of a booming time for my area for

2969
01:55:40,979 --> 01:55:48,319
cannabis hmm

2970
01:55:43,738 --> 01:55:51,419
yeah not mine no not yours

2971
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:53,340
hey Matt we didn't get you partner what

2972
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:55,859
was was what was the standout or

2973
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:58,860
standouts for you man oh [ __ ] I don't

2974
01:55:55,859 --> 01:56:01,019
know um of course a blue dream just

2975
01:55:58,859 --> 01:56:04,198
because like I it's a classic for me and

2976
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:09,239
because I'm such a blueberry head like

2977
01:56:04,198 --> 01:56:10,698
um that's that that's what I I pulled to

2978
01:56:09,238 --> 01:56:13,919
um

2979
01:56:10,698 --> 01:56:15,599
let's see like the main standouts I know

2980
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,100
everybody was stoked on the shoreline I

2981
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,600
didn't get to try that one because I was

2982
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:19,619
so busy trying everything else but

2983
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:22,560
that's the one I remember everybody

2984
01:56:19,618 --> 01:56:24,079
being real stoked on and hearing about

2985
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:27,239
um foreign

2986
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:30,019
yeah I liked Caleb's Flight Plan he's

2987
01:56:27,238 --> 01:56:32,339
called Flight Risk your flight plan

2988
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:35,219
I always get it wrong that was a good

2989
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:36,840
one Flight Risk slight risk there you go

2990
01:56:35,219 --> 01:56:38,960
yeah that makes more sense in Flight

2991
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:41,880
Plan

2992
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:44,698
and then there was he had one called

2993
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:46,679
um the the blackberry wine 69. it was

2994
01:56:44,698 --> 01:56:50,460
real unique and tasted and smelled like

2995
01:56:46,679 --> 01:56:53,520
wine like a Chardonnay that was cool

2996
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:58,739
um there was the the

2997
01:56:53,520 --> 01:57:01,380
uh sweet 16 I want to say yeah that was

2998
01:56:58,738 --> 01:57:03,599
really good I like that one paints and

2999
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:05,159
burp selection I think yeah it was from

3000
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:07,500
the pinks and purps like because I'm a

3001
01:57:05,158 --> 01:57:10,618
Blackberry Widow hybrid Mendo perps type

3002
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:12,960
thing real cool yeah yeah we kept going

3003
01:57:10,618 --> 01:57:15,118
back to that jar as a matter of fact

3004
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,560
yeah there was so much stuff there that

3005
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:18,658
it was just ridiculous to try to go

3006
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,219
through it all there when I got home I I

3007
01:57:18,658 --> 01:57:21,179
didn't tried the Death Star much while I

3008
01:57:20,219 --> 01:57:23,520
was there when I got home I really

3009
01:57:21,179 --> 01:57:25,980
enjoyed it you know

3010
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:28,380
um p91 I finally got to try when I got

3011
01:57:25,979 --> 01:57:30,658
home and and that was really good really

3012
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:32,520
good grow of it

3013
01:57:30,658 --> 01:57:35,759
um

3014
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:37,500
God and it Denali silver Pearl I never

3015
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,239
get enough of silver Pearl that was just

3016
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:41,219
so good and I've never had outdoor

3017
01:57:39,238 --> 01:57:43,079
silver Pearl yet and it was still pretty

3018
01:57:41,219 --> 01:57:44,579
good I liked it and it actually had a

3019
01:57:43,079 --> 01:57:46,079
pretty pretty strong high for silver

3020
01:57:44,579 --> 01:57:50,658
Pearl

3021
01:57:46,079 --> 01:57:50,658
21 21 at least

3022
01:57:52,618 --> 01:57:58,859
yeah that's what I dug for sure

3023
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,779
I was wondering I have a bag of that

3024
01:57:58,859 --> 01:58:01,799
silver Pearl it was smoked on the other

3025
01:58:00,779 --> 01:58:04,380
night and it looked like something

3026
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:06,800
Denali put out so tasty

3027
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:06,800
yeah yeah

3028
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:13,079
backyard victory garden yeah

3029
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:15,779
you know and so he gets to do a bunch of

3030
01:58:13,079 --> 01:58:18,420
favorites and stuff like that so yeah

3031
01:58:15,779 --> 01:58:19,979
um yeah he had he had a I gave him uh my

3032
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:22,319
Sour Diesel cut he had a pretty nice

3033
01:58:19,979 --> 01:58:24,718
example of that

3034
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:25,500
um you know I didn't even get to try

3035
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:27,380
that

3036
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:30,479
no I don't know

3037
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:33,300
it's a hard one outside like the flavor

3038
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:35,819
varies a lot outdoor but the potency is

3039
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:37,619
there yeah for sure

3040
01:58:35,819 --> 01:58:38,939
oh wait no I take that back he did I did

3041
01:58:37,618 --> 01:58:41,279
get to try that one he sent it to me

3042
01:58:38,939 --> 01:58:43,979
beforehand it was good did it really

3043
01:58:41,279 --> 01:58:45,539
good Outdoors yeah I was like wow this

3044
01:58:43,979 --> 01:58:46,799
actually is really good sour at first he

3045
01:58:45,539 --> 01:58:48,300
didn't know he's like I don't know if

3046
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,440
this is good or not I was like no it's

3047
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:52,619
actually coming through in the outdoor

3048
01:58:49,439 --> 01:58:55,919
it has a great smell yeah

3049
01:58:52,618 --> 01:58:57,779
the sour so variable outdoor it is

3050
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,819
but you know

3051
01:58:57,779 --> 01:59:02,399
I feel like the high normally is there

3052
01:58:59,819 --> 01:59:05,219
it's just the flavor and the looks you

3053
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:06,719
know and for me are very variable

3054
01:59:05,219 --> 01:59:09,359
definitely

3055
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:11,760
it takes a long time high in Lonesome so

3056
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:12,539
you really need a good season

3057
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,280
yeah

3058
01:59:12,539 --> 01:59:16,198

anyone does follow on Instagram or

3147
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,920
whatnot I have a tendency to kind of

3148
02:02:42,658 --> 02:02:46,618
post some things that I'll be working

3149
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:48,300
with maybe a couple months ahead of time

3150
02:02:46,618 --> 02:02:49,920
um and that's for me to get an idea as

3151
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:51,719
to what I'm doing right it's Paul part

3152
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,859
of the betting process but

3153
02:02:51,719 --> 02:02:55,500
um if you're wondering what might be

3154
02:02:52,859 --> 02:02:58,559
coming down uh the pipe here in the next

3155
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:59,639
six months to a year or shorter

3156
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,900
um you know there's some good things in

3157
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:01,859
the works

3158
02:03:00,899 --> 02:03:03,598
um

3159
02:03:01,859 --> 02:03:05,039
I'll say that Shoreline is on that

3160
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:08,219
Shoreline and that green crack is on the

3161
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:09,960

02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:17,039
hope I think that's it in the books I

3166
02:03:15,539 --> 02:03:20,179
think it's a good idea that might be

3167
02:03:17,039 --> 02:03:20,179

3168
02:03:20,779 --> 02:03:27,000
