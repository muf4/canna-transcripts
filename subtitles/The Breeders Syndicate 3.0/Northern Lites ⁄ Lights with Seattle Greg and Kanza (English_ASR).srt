14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,760

well

20
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,759
i think i think that's a lot of the

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
appeal and talking to you is that your

22
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,319
experiences and unfortunately a lot of

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,040
your peers and colleagues are are unable

24
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,719
to share their stories and so uh well i

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
have to thank you as an indoor grower

26
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,478
for all your horticultural contributions

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,640
obviously if it wasn't for your work

28
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,239
with the northern lights

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,400
many of us wouldn't have had the success

30
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,039
we had today

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,000
well it was kind of a group effort out

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,000
of seattle you know had the lights and

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
you know we were all young and we're

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,599
just tired of smoking mexican

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,640
you know i mean it wasn't

36
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:54,798
i mean it just wasn't doing anything for

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,519
our ptsd symptoms and it wasn't

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,399
i mean even comparable to anything that

39
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:04,239
we got in asia when we went to thailand

40
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,320
and vietnam and you know

41
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,439
i mean it just didn't get as well we

42
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,439
basically had to do it i lived in first

43
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,280
fell in seattle i lived in the ballard

44
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,919
area and i was actually shopping at the

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
indoor sun shop for a few years and

46
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,000
around that time is when i learned about

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
steve murphy and his books

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,840
i'm curious what around what time did

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
you meet steve

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,520

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,039
away from it

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,599
um yeah i was growing upstairs and uh i

56
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,280
mean the apartment that i was renting

57
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,560
but uh i knew that

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,598
the history was right right in that area

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,159
oh yeah you know kevin and

60
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,959
the other murphy family then

61
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,878
i know sean uh steve's son

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,759
and uh that's who i've had that's who i

63
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,479
spoke to the most uh sean um just trying

64
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:02,318
to ask him questions and uh

65
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,959
so that did you originally obtain uh the

66
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:08,000
afghan from steve murphy

67
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,199
yeah right after my first son was born

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,639
uh but he invited this over to a party

69
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,318
and he gave me

70
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,359
four seats

71
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,598
of an afghanistan variety

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,400
the said that some friend

73
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,479
brought back on vacation

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,280
and that was the uh

75
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,238
uh that was the real wide range

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,680
frame that was in his first book

77
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
yeah yeah

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,239
yeah

79
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,479
i've got a picture of him

80
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,920
i was always curious oh yeah that's the

81
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,119
one he gave me and then we uh we crossed

82
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,439
out with

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,560
everything we could get our hands on or

84
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,878
we crossed it with mexican we crossed it

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,878
with thai we crossed it with a whole

86
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,959
bunch of stuff and

87
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,919
i got a whole bunch of seeds that we

88
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,080
only got to basically use about one

89
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,919
percent but you know

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,680
i mean it was uh it was fun

91
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,158
was it the males that you got from those

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,719
feeds that you crossed into them no we

93
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,479
got uh

94
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,239
two males and

95
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,518
two females and we just made more seats

96
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
okay

97
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,199
and then we also basically took this

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,439
recipe to reproduce and then we quit

99
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,600
available in town you know which was

100
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,319
colombian

101
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,199
we did a lot of crossing uh

102
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,959
and then figured out real quick

103
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,439
or where they were going to be able to

104
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,399
test all these and the cops were banging

105
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:41,439
on everybody's door and everybody got to

106
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,319
jail it was pretty chaotic

107
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,759
oh i

108
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,759
i can't imagine at that time

109
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,478
so see the

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,879
the afghan you got from steve murphy

111
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:56,159
how how does that relate to northern

112
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,839
lights one is is steve mercy the north

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
did he call it northern lights or did it

114
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,399
was it just an avenue no it's just but i

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,960
came up with the northern lights the

116
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,359
original spelling of the northern lights

117
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,079
that we sort of sent to devil uh was

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,199
like lipes

119
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,000
and then it got over to holland and it's

120
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,478
just uh i think there's like

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,279
evil's cousin robert

122
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,599
i was basically handling the catalog and

123
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,319
he basically like he changed the

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,800
spelling but the original spelling on

125
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,959
the varieties that i made

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,960
was i mean like in the northern lights

127
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,918
but that's just the

128
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,918
historical fact that everybody does

129
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,879
yeah so you know that

130
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,240
you spelled it l-i-t-e

131
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,478
yes

132
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,639
by northern lights yeah that's the name

133
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,399
i gave to neville and then he changed it

134
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,639
and we just kind of decided that was

135
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,529
okay because it was already done in the

136
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,600
catalog

137
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:02,478
[Laughter]

138
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,199
so how did you meet neville i was over

139
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,758
at my buddy you saw a hair salon now you

140
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,319
know the university district

141
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,960
that's by fremont

142
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,080
uh the university district

143
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,758
i mean over there by husky stadium

144
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,000
yeah absolutely

145
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,280
yeah i had a buddy that had a uh like

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,519
hairspray still on that we'd hang out

147
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,359
and kind of do things and he always had

148
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,279
a high times uh

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
for the people to read on the table

150
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,559
there while you're waiting to get your

151
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,879
hair cut

152
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,800
and there was a little ad in the back of

153
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,759
the high times you know and that was

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,879
neville's first dad i think

155
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,038
that was the 84 year or so

156
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:49,680
yeah i think so so i sent him uh

157
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,839
some seats

158
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,959
and

159
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,439
it's about six o'clock in the morning

160
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,399
and i get a phone call the old lady

161
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:05,120
announces phone call and it's never

162
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,120
said i had a hard time tracking you down

163
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,598
and then basically

164
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,839
and then we basically

165
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,240
talked and she said man i need some more

166
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:20,399
of them indoor seats panels they're just

167
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,400
blowing the doors out of rosenbaum's

168
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,799
and i thought well that's good you know

169
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,279
i mean they're

170
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,520
they're probably a lot fresher than this

171
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,839
because i mean land gave them the seed

172
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,839
collection

173
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,319
yeah

174
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:42,159
so you had given some previously to ed

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,639
no that comes later uh basically uh

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,800
but we talked first for a while and he

177
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,918
offered to pay for my airfare over

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,120
the first trip over to holland was on a

179
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,000
uh

180
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,680
i was on like a martin airlines it was

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,918
uh

182
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,478
it's about

183
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,719
210 dollars one way and it was a prop

184
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,878
plane it took forever

185
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,599
and they basically uh they picked up the

186
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,240
passengers in oakland and

187
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,439
and by the time they got to seattle they

188
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,439
were already drunk

189
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,758
and then the seattle passengers piled on

190
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,038
and we had about a

191
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,319
10 hour flight over to amsterdam and by

192
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,719
the time and

193
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,639
on everybody got there we were pretty

194
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,278
burned out and everything and i never

195
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,759
was right there at the airport smoking

196
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,759
the joint

197
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,679
what year do you think that was i went

198
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,918
over

199
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,159
like in the earlier

200
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,559
it was 84

201
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,919
and like 85 but then i went back with

202
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,518
the wife

203
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,000
i mean after he bought cannabis castle

204
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,240
so you went over the first year in 84 by

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,399
yourself

206
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,360
yeah yeah

207
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:08,080
the fall and then we went back again

208
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,800
and then i basically i helped him

209
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,040
just i do like a recipe for cannabis

210
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,838
castle

211
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,079
i mean because like he had a

212
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,080
he had a little operation in his wine

213
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,278
cellar in the basement he had a nice

214
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,278
basement

215
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,320
oh i bet have you ever been to cannabis

216
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:25,919
castle

217
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,000
oh god

218
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,958
i've researched a lot about it and

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,958
certainly on the bucket list

220
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,298
[Music]

221
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,440
so did you share seeds with neville

222
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,519
multiple times or just uh when you

223
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,480
found the ad of his

224
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:50,320
i said never let me see two shipments

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,000
there was one

226
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,640
smaller initial shipment and then i went

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,519
and i talked to him and i got together

228
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,679
with my people after i got back and then

229
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,639
we shipped him more

230
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,399
i wasn't the only guy that was breathing

231
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,039
you know we had

232
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,559
uh but we had like a team because uh due

233
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,759
to the

234
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:19,359
art of the police pressure

235
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:22,000
we basically uh wanted to basically have

236
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
all these screens and at least three

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,399
people's hands in case

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,200
i didn't know everybody gets busted

239
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,240
maybe we can keep it you know but it was

240
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,160
i mean it was a losing battle

241
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,560
so what do you think you're right what

242
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,879
do you think the original cross was with

243
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,679
steve murphy's ass game that you guys

244
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,159
made

245
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,078
well with the app cam i could get more

246
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,639
scenes so i mean

247
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,439
he only gave me four feet but we wanted

248
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,480
to get more seats uh then we crossed it

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,800
with everything uh

250
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,800
oh yeah i mean like a lot of exits

251
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,799
okay

252
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,679

no

297
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,800
that was like one third like a way too

298
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,839
long ago and you know like at that point

299
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,519
in time

300
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,120
uh

301
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,679
cheating records uh was they uh i mean

302
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,399
like or any pictures or anything

303
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,479
like that real liability because of all

304
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,078
the costs you know oh for sure i

305
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,920
completely understand

306
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,399
i completely understand

307
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,639
so it's just uh the record keeping back

308
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,440
then now it's all changed you know now

309
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,440
we can basically be scientists

310
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,519
okay

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,519
uh then uh

312
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,919
the only people who could basically do

313
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,159
that on a rational basis i was over in

314
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,838
holland that's why i went there

315
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,000
yeah i mean like it wasn't about the

316
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,959
money it was to get the medicine out of

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,278
the people that was the main mission

318
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:34,879
do do you have any memory of what the

319
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:38,639

shorter ones and we made that number two

341
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,319
that's great

342
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,240
huh

343
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,000
i said that's great info because those

344
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,959
the one and two or some of the ones that

345
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,958
neville continued on

346
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,198
well it's it's just so when i went over

347
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,958
to holland you know they were doing some

348
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,278
uh i mean

349
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,958
there were some people breeding a lot

350
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,559
with uh

351
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:52,799
for the number

352
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:54,909
two like uh jay jackson did the k2 which

353
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:59,838
was real nice

354
00:14:54,909 --> 00:15:02,719
[Music]

355
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,360
so if you'll mind me asking how did you

356
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,199
meet kirby nelson i understand he was an

357
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,959
employee of thieves

358
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,639
yeah that's just what hurt me went to

359
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,119
ballard too

360
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,799
we all went to the same high school

361
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,879
oh we just were you in the same class

362
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,639
uh

363
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,958
i don't think so

364
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,198
okay all i know is we all went to

365
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,439
ballard we were all from ballard you

366
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,519
know we are

367
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
what can you tell us about his hawaiian

368
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,440
plant

369
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,959
a herby

370
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,079
[Music]

371
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,679
and i

372
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:42,000
uh

373
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:45,919
basically traded some clone and he just

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,879
said it was a speed afghani cross with

375
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,879
the hawaiian switzerland

376
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
oh that's all

377
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,440
oh that's all he told me and that's all

378
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,079
i know but you know i mean it was

379
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,800
i mean it was against future fest all

380
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,039
over the world i mean it had to hype

381
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,359
adventure and it had what everybody

382
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,399
wanted at the time you know

383
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,199
i mean we were able to basically grow a

384
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,399
uh

385
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,639
24 inch bud

386
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,159
on about a five foot

387
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,720
flat with that and that was in uh

388
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,719
i mean 84.

389
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,039
i need to click the winner

390
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:32,399
i mean it was a winner it was uh

391
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,480
i mean it was just one of them

392
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,320
flukes in nature i

393
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,480
think were all all the genetics

394
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,959
clicked and it all fell into place at

395
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,278
the right time

396
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,198
sounds like it so that's the clone that

397
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,439
you use to make northern lights number

398
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,078
five

399
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
uh i didn't make number five what herbie

400
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,958
did

401
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,839
then we uh

402
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,119
crossed number five with the number one

403
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,000
and you know

404
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,279
i mean it just gave us uh

405
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,160
uh the fifty percent says so diva and

406
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,720
about triple the vigor you know

407
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,279
so he crossed the clone that he gave you

408
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,199
with the number one

409
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,279
yes you're correct

410
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,360
so was herbies did he have um steve

411
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,838
murphy's afghani is that the afghani

412
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,038
that's in number five

413
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,879
yeah

414
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,599
okay yeah i think that's where the

415
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,600
confusion was

416
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,359
yeah i was just trying to understand the

417
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:36,319
history on that line so that that

418
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:39,759
the clone that he had or gave to you

419
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:43,519
that was made from steve speed

420
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,519
that was a half game okay

421
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,839
yeah that changed the [ __ ] world the

422
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,759
genetics for good

423
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,399
yeah

424
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:55,200
i mean like i mean like it won some

425
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,519
cannabis cups for sure

426
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,240
was real happy with it now i mean that

427
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:04,079
way he bought cannabis castle with it

428
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,079
yeah that's the damage right

429
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
so do you think it was a hawaiian plant

430
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,038
that herbie had that he crossed the

431
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,480
steep i'm sorry i'm having trouble

432
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,519
falling

433
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,599
uh

434
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,839
i have no idea

435
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,000
and it's just uh

436
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,639
i haven't talked to herbie and i don't

437
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,880
know if he even wants to talk to anybody

438
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,200
so it's just i don't know what the deal

439
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,720
is there but you know i just

440
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,600
just uh

441
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,679
i mean it all happened a long time ago

442
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,619
and there's basically no written record

443
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:41,120
but you guys are right about that

444
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:43,839
[Music]

445
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,959
uh there's been a lot of

446
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,399
a lot of discussion about the indian of

447
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,079
the indian

448
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,038
uh uh the indian was gone down he's

449
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:58,399
passed away years ago now so

450
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,558
which is how we met don when uh

451
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,480
by the guy that owns the hair salon

452
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,918
raleigh

453
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,759
his name was raleigh

454
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,240
yeah

455
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,000
i mean what he brings a guy over and

456
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,480
when he was an injured worker a lot

457
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,880
older guys

458
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,679
or they weren't given enough money

459
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,200
to derail the rib rights so we set him

460
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,679
up with a full four light operation

461
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,759
and we gave him some seeds and some

462
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,640
cuttings and he did some breathing for

463
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,960
us

464
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,759
do you know any of the lines that don

465
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,759
may have contributed

466
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,599
uh dawn

467
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,919
contributed

468
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,159
half of the genetics

469
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,080
for the number two

470
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,640
yeah that's true

471
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,599
okay and then we got uh

472
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,000
and then after i went over to the street

473
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,399
level then we went down to portland and

474
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,038
we got the hash plant laying the bigfoot

475
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,000
off at george

476
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:03,679
do you remember what time that was

477
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,759
that was when this is all right before

478
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:10,640
george did his first book with my

479
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,000
uh officers with my youngest son on the

480
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,919
cover

481
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,759
yeah i have to look at the days i know

482
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,919
what you're referring to

483
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,200
that's pretty cool

484
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,400
when was the last time you spoke to

485
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,440
georgia

486
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,038
the last time i spoke to george was up

487
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,120
in vancouver uh when i basically gave

488
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,440
them all the lead i had left over

489
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,798
because i had to go to the border

490
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,038
and that was years ago

491
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,918
many years ago but we're good friends

492
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,839
everybody well steward you know

493
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,840
yeah i just spoke to him recently he was

494
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,199
a wealth of good information he was very

495
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,119
receptive and

496
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,159
so that's why i'm interested in talking

497
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,879
to everybody from your generation all

498
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,880
the yeah

499
00:20:53,119 --> 00:21:00,479
we traded with george i

500
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,480
kind of forget what we gave him i think

501
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,038
we might have gave him the number five i

502
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,360
don't know but he gave us the hash plant

503
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:11,359
and then he gave us the big book

504
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:13,918
but the hash plant was the one

505
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,479
that was a real good one too

506
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,799
that was a real favorite was a real

507
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,558
shitty yielder but everybody loved the

508
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,158
taste in the eye

509
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,599
and that was the one that was that

510
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,600
neville collected obviously when he

511
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,399
visited the states

512
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,639
yeah

513
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,720
yeah i think he went down and sort of

514
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,720
saw george urging the people in portland

515
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
what do you think do were you aware that

516
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,839
neville came in and visited the state oh

517
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,919
yeah we went down to the airport and saw

518
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,558
neville and he was grown and had his

519
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,559
head up his ass he was with roger you

520
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,158
know who roger is

521
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:49,038
i've read the name i don't know who he

522
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,080
is

523
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:55,038
uh roger granwich i think is the

524
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:58,000
spelling he was neville's like american

525
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,279
representative first and everything and

526
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,159
he kind of

527
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,960
he kind of flew into seattle and then he

528
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,360
went down to see uh

529
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,240
clyde in l.a and then he went down to

530
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,479
rosenthal he was kind of like a devil's

531
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,839
agent in the

532
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
got it

533
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,038
so where what airport could you see

534
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,720
neville at

535
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,640
two is in a

536
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,960
hotel uh just east of seatac

537
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,960
okay

538
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:31,678
no i'm not sure what one it was a long

539
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,960
long time ago there's a lot of hotels on

540
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
there bro

541
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,279
so do you think the purpose of that trip

542
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:41,519
was to get more northern lights or was

543
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:44,558
he just coming for genetics in general

544
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,679
uh i've got no idea what was in devil's

545
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:50,798
mind uh then i knew this is that's way

546
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,798
beyond my page right

547
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,639
that's fair

548
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,079
yeah i'm just trying to piece together

549
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,839
the history of all this what year is

550
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,279
gonna estimate you think that you flew

551
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,639
in

552
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:13,359
it was like i mean like 85 it was around

553
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,360
christmas time

554
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,639
i remember that it was cold and nasty

555
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,839
and

556
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,840
uh but the kids were visiting

557
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,240
that was kind of

558
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,158
so i

559
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,720
had you sent him the northern lights

560
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,720
five clones before that trip

561
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,679
closed uh yeah i mean this is a roger

562
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,319
came and he sent one

563
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,640
i mean over to neville uh we got one i

564
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,439
mean i knew you know we got him a clone

565
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,360
and he got one of these a glass bowl

566
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,200
prairie and things at some uh flora shop

567
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,278
and

568
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,600
trim the leaves off certainly weren't

569
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,359
necessarily didn't that's how he got it

570
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,439
over the hall

571
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,399
that was pretty genius

572
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,519
yeah

573
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,519
yeah that's what i thought

574
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,158
it got there just fine

575
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,319
but just just to recap you said that

576
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,760
kirby made the ml5 so when you got that

577
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:31,599
clone you were given it as in l5

578
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:34,158
yeah yeah that was on the nl5 i was like

579
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:38,319
finding like herbies uh

580
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:40,720
cross with the hawaiian and uh steve

581
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,558
murphy's afghani

582
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,360
so you you didn't make the cross you

583
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:49,359
just got the clone from herbie and seat

584
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,359
of this uh line to give to neville

585
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,919
well yeah we took it to see

586
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,239
and we gave him the seed first but i

587
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,600
mean like he wanted the original clown

588
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,079
but we got him the original clown

589
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,719
okay so the seed metal receives came off

590
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,720
herby's mom

591
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,480
uh

592
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,720
uh by the seats

593
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,720
i mean it's just like he got uh

594
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,959
yeah

595
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,599
okay because what we did after we got

596
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,600
the number five we basically began

597
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,000
crossing it with everything we could get

598
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,879
our hands on and what

599
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,200
and

600
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,400
the issue so what we got looked real

601
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,720
similar that's what went the level

602
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,640
i mean like about the frame size with

603
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,600
that like a mounted figure it was the

604
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,080
reader oh that was the deal you know i

605
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:49,519
mean it was the vigor and the taste and

606
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,960
it was just our superiors so we

607
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,359
tried to read

608
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:58,079
i mean like i replicated that by doing

609
00:25:53,359 --> 00:26:01,278
seeds and uh and we've been working on

610
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:03,439
it for a while but we i mean you know

611
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,119
speeds are variable

612
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
clones aren't

613
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,839
totally how long do you think you guys

614
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,080
kept herbies clone

615
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,079
around i lost that when the cops braided

616
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,558
tom lost that after his fun

617
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:26,400
took over the operation

618
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,400
and we had some crop failures so it's

619
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,038
just i don't know if anybody has the

620
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,600
original clone but then

621
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:38,879
i don't even know it neville or

622
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,879
where it's just uh you know scott does

623
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,720
yeah

624
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,199
yeah

625
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,759
yeah now they might have the original

626
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,200
chrome i mean well i don't i don't think

627
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,200
anybody didn't see that with us

628
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,000
oh

629
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,038
maybe 20 years ago

630
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
okay

631
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,720
so out of all the seeds that you guys

632
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,558
made was there a favorite that stood out

633
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,600
to you

634
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:10,240
yeah we like the indicas the shorter

635
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:13,519
indicators uh the number

636
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,000
uh the shorter ones with the uh what we

637
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,879
were looking for was more medicinal

638
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,919
value uh

639
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,240
and uh quick turn around

640
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,799
so when you're talking about dawn down

641
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,960
one dawn's the afghani hybrid was that a

642
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,278
clone that he gave you

643
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,679
or those speeds

644
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,679
oh we got both

645
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,559
okay

646
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,679
and then also had something that he gave

647
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,599
us that he called big bud that was uh

648
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,798
man like it wasn't the same as the big

649
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:49,798
bud we got off at george

650
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,798
interesting

651
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,120
i mean it was

652
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,640
fluffier and it

653
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,879
had more oil

654
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,399
content i think that was the number

655
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,960
eight

656
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:06,000
of the ml number eight sheet so it was

657
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,558
the the real [ __ ] big bud that had

658
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,480
all the oil glam so we used to go down

659
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,038
to dawn's and get a

660
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,640
i mean like a pound or two and you know

661
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,720
all the people they'd come back and

662
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,520
they'd dump it on the table and they'd

663
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,600
go

664
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,759
for that number eight well every time

665
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,240
they could see the difference

666
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,278
but we mix it all together usually you

667
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,159
know

668
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,319
i mean we're just doing a one two three

669
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,960
light operations

670
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,879
so the numbered one through

671
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,840
ten or the number of northern lights

672
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,440
were those using these afghani or the

673
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,439
northern lights number one that you made

674
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,079
so it just depends on the number

675
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,960
uh the higher the number the taller the

676
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,119
plant

677

succeeded

740
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,519
i mean look what's going on in oregon

741
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,798

742
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,798
concentrates for a buck

743
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,798
yeah it's certainly going that way i'm

744
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,679
not looking for you

745
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,679
but you know you guys are seed breeders

746
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,240
that's a different game you know it's

747
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,840
just by these big guys that

748
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,159
i mean they're gonna

749
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,918
about they think they can go indoors and

750
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,679
make it killing and everything because

751
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,799
you can't compete with the sun like

752
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,559
mexico or the labor cost you know

753
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,038
oh for sure so

754
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,519

755
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:08,240
with uh the drunkards family

756
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,880
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just like i

757
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,240
milled uh like a pen and keys the whole

758
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,240
collection

759
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,919
i mean this is how they were real

760
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,960
helpful they gave us the fertilizer

761
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,120
formula that's what we were interested

762
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,558
i mean in mainly you know

763
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,038
it's just that we got neville's

764
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,639
fertilizer cooked

765
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,278
we got ben's foreign

766
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,679
foreign like and then we came back to

767
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,679
the u.s and we made our own fertilizer

768
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:41,439
and it was a two-part

769
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:44,720
oh yeah now we had a two-part before

770
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,720
general hydro did

771
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,120
i was called a wonder girl

772
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,439
and then we got busted in the old way

773
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:57,798
she freaked out

774
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,798
no i couldn't just pour

775
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:16,480
watson and sam my

776
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:18,720
you know i mean has always been kind of

777
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,679
i'm better than you and i'm saying i'm

778
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,480
the man and you know i mean he's always

779
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,720
been real disrespectful as far as i'm

780
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,000
concerned i mean like he's done a good

781
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,919
job but my hat's off to him i mean it's

782
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,119
just like he can take his ego and cram

783
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,440
it up his ass as far as i'm concerned

784
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,199
that's how i feel too excuse me you

785
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,240
think that's the universal opinion he

786
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,880
didn't have many friends

787
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,679

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,359
the ads that you guys are publishing or

1013
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,838
how are they coming out from chicago in

1014
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:55,838
these areas

1015
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,159
we

1016
00:42:56,838 --> 00:42:59,440
ran though

1017
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,679
i made a

1018
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,599
couple of ads fertilizer and rockwool

1019
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:09,039
for a while

1020
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:13,519
until the feds closed this down

1021
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:15,920
oh that was more trouble than it were

1022
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,119
so how many people were you say involved

1023
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,639
that were in the breeding of the

1024
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,519
different northern lights

1025
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:24,000
you said it was kind of a group people

1026
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:26,800
well it was a core group and then there

1027
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,880
was uh i mean it's just now that's hard

1028
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,200
to say

1029
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,960
that's hard to say

1030
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,239
i mean there were people that came and

1031
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,679
went so it just didn't be up around the

1032
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,919
actual group uh basically it just kept

1033
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,279
changing because everybody was in and

1034
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,119
out of jail

1035
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,800
so it's just like it's hard to put a

1036
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,318
number on it

1037
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,519
i understand

1038
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,358

1039
