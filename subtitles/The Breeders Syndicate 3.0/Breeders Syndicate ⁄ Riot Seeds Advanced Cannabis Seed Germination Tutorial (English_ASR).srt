00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,719
hello everyone welcome to the uh breeder

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,879
syndicate riot seeds germination

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,439
tutorial i figured i just start from

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,559
scratch um but the first thing i can't

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,599
really show you because there's no sink

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,480
here

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,160
wash your hands wash them thoroughly

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
wash them with soap

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,079
get up in there

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,679
hot water super important kill all the

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,839
bacteria

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,559
a lot of the germination process is

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,920
defeated by bacteria

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,479
so yeah so we'll start with that we have

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,760
some fresh paper towels brand new

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,599
we have a clean surface for our

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,920
um

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
for our wet paper towel to sit on in

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,640
between before it goes in bags also i'm

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,558
gonna do a little advanced

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,640
tutorial while we're doing this we have

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,399
some old scissors here but one of the

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
first things we want to do with our

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
scissors as well

25
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,759
is everything else involved we want to

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,759
clean those i'm using some lysol wipes

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,439
on these just because because i've used

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,079
these for trimming and all kinds of

29
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,640
crazy [ __ ] but um

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,840
yeah these scissors are nice great

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,439
they're small if you'll notice they're

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
very small in my hands

33
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,000
and you can get these on amazon pretty

34
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,280
cheap

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
and they're sharp and they're precise

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,719
when you're when you're doing advanced

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,118
seat cracking you want to use

38
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,039
uh sharp precise

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,640
um scissors that you can control with

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,600
your hands and that you can feel stuff

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
through because you're going to feel

42
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,679
that seed crack and you want to stop the

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,118
second you fill them so

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,960
first off what we're going to do is get

45
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,280
our distilled water so i've filled this

46
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,078
up this beaker up with 500 milliliters

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,079
distilled water

48
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,599
you know a lot of people like to wet

49
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,879
their paper towels in distilled water

50
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,239
that's fine

51
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,239
um but

52
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,000
what also helps a lot is hydrogen

53
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,078
peroxide there's been scientific studies

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,118
done on this i watched one recently the

55
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,559
other day on youtube where uh i can't

56
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,280
remember if is utah university or

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,079
somewhere like that did a study on

58
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,920
cannabis and hemp seed germination rates

59
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,319
with hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen

60
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,159
peroxide did increase the rate so

61
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,000
i um

62
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
yeah i always

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,758
i tell people to use hydrogen peroxide

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,039
it's been an old standby for years and

65
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,079
it keeps the amount of decamp

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,679
decontamination down as best as you can

67
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
that's important okay so there's a brand

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,400
new hydrogen peroxide normally i do like

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
a one percent solution

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
so uh

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,719
5

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,800
milliliters to 500 but i'm just going to

73
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,639
eyeball it

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
there we go should be enough should be

75
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,079
enough maybe

76
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,479
right there

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
okay

78
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,079
a little more than five but it'll be

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,640
okay for what our purposes are

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,239
next step

81
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,958
you get your seeds right here we have

82
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,719
some ice cream bananas which is a banana

83
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,920
og blue bonnet

84
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,560
you want to open up the package um so

85
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,559
open it up

86
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,878
everything got a good lysol wipe down

87
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:06,079
before this so it's a little slippery

88
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,518
all right so it comes sealed package

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
one of our shells

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,840
right

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,080
you want to take your paper towels

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,920
here's three i only need one because

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,560
we're only doing one strain today so one

94
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,158
section of paper towel

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
you want to make sure that this is all

96
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,158
nice and mixed up homogeneous as best

97
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,080
you can i mean there's no magnetic

98
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,359
stirrer under it but for our purposes

99
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,799
it'll be fine

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,959
you take your paper towel and you fold

101
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,959
it

102
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,479
and you gently dip it in the water

103
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,318
hydrogen peroxide mixture

104
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,639
and then

105
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,759
very importantly is the moisture content

106
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,039
that you want to use you want to wring

107
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,318
out the water

108
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,840
pretty good

109
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,878
you want it to where there's enough

110
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,519
moisture to the to the embryo wanting to

111
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,878
hunt its way out of this of the shell

112
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
but you don't want so much moisture that

113
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,878
it's waterlogged so as you can see

114
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:01,759
no drippage no nothing it's just wet

115
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,280
it's wet not sopping wet

116
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,959
and then you'll take your seat pack

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,799
hopefully you'll be doing more in

118
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,719
10 to 13 but

119
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,080
for this like i said for our purposes it

120
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,519
works well

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,359
so you put down your seeds how many

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,680
seeds are in this five 10 12 seeds

123
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,599
um

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,680
now i was going to show the advanced

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,960
cracking tutorial so let's say you get

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
some

127
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,359
really

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,478
really nice

129
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,479
healthy

130
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,399
thick shelled afghani type seeds so i'll

131
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,039
pick the biggest shell we got here

132
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,239
thickest shell now sometimes some people

133
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
may think that the seed isn't

134
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,519
germinating but what's happening is that

135
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,839
water isn't getting into its shell

136
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,439
right so i've seen people throw away so

137
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,119
many good seeds thinking that they

138
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,478
weren't germinating they weren't viable

139
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
but the problem was the shell was just

140
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,719
too thick to let water in

141
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,960
in these extreme cases and

142
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
it really is a case-by-case basis on

143
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,879
whether i do this or not sometimes i'll

144
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,639
do this with seeds that don't pop after

145
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,639
you know three days of being in the in

146
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,319
the wet paper towel i'll tend to take

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
them out hand crack all the ones that

148
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,719
didn't just in case that's the issue

149
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,959
i don't normally start off by hand

150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,120
cracking anything but for this purpose

151
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,719
so you can see how it's done i wanted to

152
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,160
show you so

153
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,560
we take it

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,320
now there is a seam along the top i know

155
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,079
this is not going to be perfect but we

156
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,199
have there's a seam along the top of the

157
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:26,319
seat and we gently rest the seed so it

158
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,600
sits in there like like that

159
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,839
long ways

160
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,680
and you want to gently apply pressure

161
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,079
put it all the way at the very very back

162
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
as far back as you can go inside

163
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,279
the thing and when you start applying

164
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
pressure the second you feel and hear

165
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,399
the crack you're good

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,120
hopefully you were able to hear that

167
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
and we hand cracked that one so we just

168
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,000
then toss it back

169
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,038
with the rest of them we close it up

170
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,439
close up shop

171
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,360
get a brand new ziploc baggie i like to

172
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,240
use the the court freezer baggies

173
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,080
because the thicker plastic heavier mill

174
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,199
or whatever

175
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,199
i put it in the baggie

176
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,719
we

177
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,079
i always take out most of the air for

178
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
whatever reason just so it doesn't move

179
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,079
around

180
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,759
we labeled the baggie so this is what

181
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,758
ice cream bananas i

182
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,160
scream

183
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
and the last thing and i'm not going to

184
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,639
show you here but what i would do is i

185
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,839
take painters tape or certain kind of

186
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,840
tape and i put it on the back side of

187
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,918
like a cabinet or something on the back

188
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,279
side and tape it on there we don't want

189
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:46,879
it getting a lot of light we want it to

190
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,439
be in the dark and we want it in a cool

191
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,959
place we don't want it super hot we

192
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,279
don't want it cold

193
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,038
just mostly dark right

194
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,119
some temperatures might be too cold for

195
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,719
it check your check your temperatures

196
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,478
you want to keep it right around i don't

197
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,199
know 75 80 degrees-ish

198
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,680
it's about where i keep it um

199
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,400
but yeah so the reason that we tape it

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,000
up on the back side too is so gravity as

201
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,799
these seeds pop gravity will start

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,319
pulling the tap roots downwards and

203
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,000
i don't know if you've ever tried like

204
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,000
popping seeds throwing them in a drawer

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,079
like setting them in there and being

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,439
cool with it to pop they curly cue and

207
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,439
they're very hard to plant in whatever

208
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,240
medium you're going to plant them in

209
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,839
so that's why we suspend them so gravity

210
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
brings them downwards at least and so

211
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,439
they're all in a nice pattern for for

212
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,879
planting in your medium i usually plant

213
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,519
them into cocoa

214
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,918
um another little trick that i do i let

215
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,159
the seeds stay in here until they have

216
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:45,359
pushed off their seed shell so they tend

217
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,960
to be long seedlings with good taproots

218
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
and the reason for that is

219
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,198
after planting if any kind of bacterial

220
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,520
problem happens in whatever your medium

221
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,598
is it'll be attacking that that fresh

222
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,000
root system and if it has

223
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,918
you know true leaves past the cotyledons

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,519
if it has tree leaves then it can still

225
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,680
intake water or nutrients to everything

226
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,878
it needs to do

227
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,038
while the while the roots try to

228
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,199
re-establish and survive so

229
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,560
yeah those are my tips i hope you all

230
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,639
enjoyed it again um

231
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,399
five mils to 500 milliliters distilled

232
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
water to uh

233
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,120
i'm sorry hydrogen peroxide to distilled

234
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,759
water

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,319
keep everything clean clean is the key

236
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,199
keeping it clean is the freaking key and

237
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,280
i wish

238
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,240
if there's anything i can impress on you

239
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,918
with this it would be that clean is key
