14
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,840
hi

15
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,119
remember you can't tell anyone

16
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,158
what you saw happened more than 50 years

17
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,080
ago

18
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,318
the five-year-old girl followed her

19
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,879
brother's advice she never told anyone

20
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,919
about her experience in fact suppressed

21
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,959
the memory deep inside herself

22
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,919
but her brother steve remembered

23
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,239
about 10 years ago my sister called

24
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,079
and she told me that she just had

25
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
hypnosis

26
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,519
and was

27
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,280
thoroughly upset with me that i didn't

28
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,759
tell her about my little grey friends

29
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,039
which was a mystery to me because

30
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,239
she was there

31
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,000
and she'd kind of taken over my friends

32
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,920
what is the problem here why doesn't she

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,759
know about it

34
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,399
and to this day it's a total mystery why

35
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,120
she doesn't remember

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,239
in 1992 i was in the hospital with a

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,140
very serious illness for three months

38
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,120
and i went home and i was

39
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:07,679
[Music]

40
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,799
took several months for me to

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,159
get back

42
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,200
to normal

43
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,798
and during that period of time i started

44
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,319
thinking

45
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,600
about um

46
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,120
you guys was gonna make me cry

47
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,439
let's not interrupt or anything just

48
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,439
tell your story

49
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,439
[Music]

50
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,799
for the next year after i was

51
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,758
recuperating

52
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,840
from my illness i started thinking about

53
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,639
ufos and

54
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,399
not necessarily aliens but ufos and i

55
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,879
really wanted to get some information on

56
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,560
them i wasn't really sure why

57
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,918
because i'd never really been interested

58
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,319
in before

59
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,159
i'd never read anything about them i had

60
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,038
heard that people

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,360
had

62
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,599
been hypnotized and found out

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
information and i wondered if maybe

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
there was something in my past that

65
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,560
would

66
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,120
have something to do with this because

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,879
it just came up all of a sudden

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,240
and so

69
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,038
i went to a hypnotherapist and i was

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,038
hypnotized

71
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,720
and

72
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,038
it came up

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,479
i really didn't i didn't believe that i

74
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,639
had anything

75
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,560
i didn't remember anything nobody ever

76
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
said anything

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,478
but in my hypnotherapy it came up that i

78
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,159
was

79
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,038
when i was very small i was walking with

80
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,400
my brother down by this river

81
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,038
and

82
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,519
we'd seen a spacecraft

83
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,719
and that we'd gone on board

84
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,879
and

85
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,039
it didn't upset me it was very

86
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,439
interesting to me but i didn't really

87
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,079
believe it i thought well it's just

88
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,120
really my imagination and i don't

89
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,959
understand hypnosis and i don't

90
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,399
know what this is all about so i called

91
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,599
my brother

92
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:12,560
i said i had the strangest thing happen

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,600
and i had hypnosis then they said

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,759
and i said that i remember you and i

95
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
going down by the river

96
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,759
and seeing these aliens in this

97
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,879
spaceship he says do you remember

98
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
anything

99
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,399
he said well yeah don't you remember

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
going and meeting our little friends

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
i said

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,160
no i didn't remember anything about it

103
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,079
and so then he told me that

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,730
as children we used to go play with

105
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:45,359
aliens down by the river

106
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:46,840
[Music]

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,319
and

108
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,198
um asking if he knew anymore and he said

109
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,720
no

110
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
that he didn't remember anything else

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,960
but he thought there was more

112
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,479
and that he knew that i went with them

113
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,799
all the time

114
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,159
as a child and

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,598
he didn't understand why i couldn't

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,639
remember

117
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,038
and

118
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,680
i tried but there wasn't anything in my

119
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,000
memory of any of that at all

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,038
so i underwent hypnosis several more

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
times

122
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,240
and some more

123
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,598
stuff came out about aliens and

124
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
spaceships and my brother and

125
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,879
um

126
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
kind of got confusing to me because i

127
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,560
didn't really understand what was going

128
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,280
on i didn't remember why i couldn't

129
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,959
remember any of it and so i called some

130
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,598
of my friends

131
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,560
and one of my friends bill

132
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,240
said

133
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,360
yeah don't you remember the time the

134
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
light came and chased my car

135
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,520
i said no

136
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,839
i don't remember anything like that

137
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,598
i remember anybody telling me about ufos

138
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,560
or anything anytime

139
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,959
and

140
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,720
so he told me the story

141
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,079
and then i called a couple other friends

142
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,080
and they said yeah they'd seen stuff and

143
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,318
had different kinds of encounters and

144
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,318
that they remembered that all of it and

145
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,080
i remember still didn't remember

146
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,400
anything

147
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,680
kind of in my search to

148
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,799
find out

149
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,759
what the truth was for me i

150
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,759
decided i'd

151
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
try to be a remote viewer

152
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,409
and

153
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,120
so in 1995

154
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,199
[Music]

155
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,519
i was trained as a remote viewer and

156
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,680
worked as a remote viewer

157
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,879
for four years

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,158
and was very successful and

159
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,240
with the remote viewing you can

160
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,879
see ufos and

161
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,240
craft and et's and

162
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:46,879
i think i felt at that time it was real

163
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,000
but it still wasn't real to me and about

164
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,639
in august it just came back and said

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,039
like i have to tell this story

166
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,919
and i called my brother and my friends

167
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,360
and said

168
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,079
are you guys ready to talk about the

169
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,480
story and they said yes

170
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,879
that's where we are now

171
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
remembering the incident it's just like

172
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,480
we were just sitting there talking

173
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,480
verbally

174
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,639

230
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
they can't smile

231
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,839

232
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,200

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,839
eyes yes

235
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,720
how would you describe your eyes

236
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,360
big almond eyes

237
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
what kind of body do they have they have

238
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,120
a body like yours

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,120
really skinny body

240
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,958
but you get kind of emotional when you

241
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,278
think about your friends don't you

242
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,278
yeah

243
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,199
is it an emotional happy feeling

244
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,399
yes

245
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,240
so the emotions are happy for them yes

246
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,360
yes

247
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
that's why you're crying because you're

248
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,839
happy

249
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:52,039
so these friends were nice to them yes

250
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,040
i don't know why i can't talk about

251
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:59,120
linda's hypnosis began with robert hudak

252
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,160
i don't find that people can

253
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,240
fake

254
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:06,719
ab reactions in hypnosis and have

255
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,320
reaction might be something like a

256
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,079
cold sweat a shake

257
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,040
nervousness

258
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:17,120
some kind of a body movements

259
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,679
i haven't found that to be

260
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,759
something that seems to be easily faked

261
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,638
hudak's work was followed by sessions

262
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,879
with dr r leo sprinkle

263
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,519
my name is leo sprinkle i'm a counseling

264
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,600
psychologist in laramie wyoming

265
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,039
i served as a professor at the

266
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,040
university of wyoming for 25 years

267
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,879
like any ufo researcher i'm always

268
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,120
interested in more information more

269
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,320
knowledge about ufo phenomena about et

270
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,278
encounters

271
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,040
however

272
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,198
personally because of my own ufo

273
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,198
experiences i'm always impressed with

274
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,198
the courage the strength of character

275
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,359
that it takes for someone to come

276
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,719
forward and discuss his or her

277
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,759
experience

278
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,879
and anybody who does uh this knows that

279
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,639
there are not only social risks

280
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,958
but in some cases there are vocational

281
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,919
professional risks and even some people

282
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,278
security for their families or even

283
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,159
their own lives

284
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,320
and so i always am impressed whenever

285
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,838
people are willing to take the risk to

286
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
come forward to talk about their

287
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,240
experience many of the hypnosis sessions

288
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,799
were monitored by a medical doctor i've

289
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,519
been present at many hypnosis sessions

290
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,039
dealing with the ufo phenomenon

291
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,078
what interested me most was the

292
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:35,120
physiologic response of the subjects

293
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,319
i've witnessed racing pulse quickening

294
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,399
of

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,399
breathing stiffening of the body

296
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,800
fear pain

297
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,000
and the disappearance of fear and pain

298
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:51,359
as a hypnotic suggestion

299
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,600
in my opinion these physiologic effects

300
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,240
would not be faked these were real

301
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,240
experiences the subjects were feeling

302
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,120
pain or fear or seeing

303
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,440
frightful objects or

304
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,679
happy times or

305
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,680
real

306
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,760
emotions deer lodge

307
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,199
a small tight-knit community lying in

308
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:22,480
this picturesque valley in montana

309
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:25,039

howdy i'm jim mars i'm here to tell you

312
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,399
one of the most fascinating stories i've

313
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,519
encountered in my years as a journalist

314
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
and author

315
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,720
you see every little town has its

316
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,399
secrets

317
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,079
but this town has a secret that's well

318
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,958
out of this world

319
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,838
let's check it out

320
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,719
linda's quest led her on a journey back

321
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,240
to her roots back here to deer lodge

322
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,360
population 3000 a relic of the mining

323
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,839
boom

324
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,079
most of the young folks only concern was

325
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,000
how to get out of here

326
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,799
linda contacted old friends and high

327
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,320
school chums and was amazed to find out

328
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,399
that they too

329
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,839
had had strange and unusual

330
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,278
experiences

331
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680
intrigued

332
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,480
linda began to uncover the town's

333
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,278
incredible secret

334
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,759
linda spoke to many of the towns folks

335
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:25,278
some didn't want to go public but others

336
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,278
agreed to speak to the camera

337
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,959
the ladies and their husbands were up at

338
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,919
an area

339
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,838
out of town they were snowmobiling and

340
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,360

346
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,919
we were

347
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,360
up at oropino snowmobiling

348
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,599
and

349
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
helen shaffer was with me

350
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,078
and

351
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,599
the group left us by the campfire

352
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,480
and it was

353
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,480
a black knight

354
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:11,519
we were

355
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,279
standing around the campfire by

356
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,400
ourselves

357
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:22,798
and we had our dog andy

358
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,759
and the hair on andy's back stood up

359
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:30,000
and we were in the mountains

360
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:33,599
and the men had gone snowmobiling and we

361
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,839
were kind of waiting around the fire and

362
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,639
all of a sudden we could hear this

363
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:42,000
then we heard some noises

364
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:46,679
and they were kind of high pitched

365
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,679
beep beep beep beep

366
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,759
it wasn't a fast noise it was just a

367
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,159
slow noise

368
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,359
it's a high-pitched uh

369
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,200
beepy kind of sound we all got scared it

370
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:05,678
was a it was a freaking noise something

371
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,679
we knew there were no power lines or

372
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,200
anything up in that area

373
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,440
so we knew that

374
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,200
it couldn't be anything like that

375
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
and the guys set up on the top of the

376
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,038
mountain they didn't see any tracks of

377
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,000
any sort

378
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,720
because people had been seeing ufos

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,919
around at about that time

380
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,279
oh we were ready to go home yeah it was

381
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,280
scary

382
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,519
and it was something that

383
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,678
we didn't know what it was

384
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,519
you know we're used to the

385
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,759
timber and up in the mountains and that

386
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,359
but this was a sound that we'd never

387
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,599
heard before

388
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,038
people had talked a lot about spaceships

389
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,959
at that time

390
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,798
and we just imagine well maybe that's

391
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,919
what it was

392
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:54,798
i'm elaine and i'm a friend of buck and

393
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,799
helen shafer helen shaffer is

394
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,440
buck's spouse

395
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,240
buck is deceased but he did tell me

396
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,480
about an encounter that he had

397
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,079
uh i can't remember

398
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:12,000
if it was morning or evening but

399
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:15,439
he is going down the road and does see

400
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,599
a light just all of a sudden a light

401
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,400
hovering over the road

402
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,719
and he did stop and

403
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,640
then it took off said

404
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,679
i know it was

405
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,640
a ufo i think is how he referred to it

406
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,640
as their ufo

407
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,119
i'd go up in one if i had a chance

408
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,120
this leads to an area

409
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,279
known as redgate

410
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,759
used to be the favorite teen parking

411
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,480
spot you know what i mean

412
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,240
they call it red gate

413
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,240
because at the entrance

414
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,980
was an old wooden gate very much like

415
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,079
this one painted red

416
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,480
[Music]

417
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:59,038
this was the hub of all the strange

418
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,038
activity

419
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,400

just uh to the east of town

432
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,039
um everybody just seemed to think it was

433
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:37,918
a possessed area something with the

434
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,640
devil

436
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,240
you know but nobody seemed to know the

437
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,120
whole story behind it or why it was

438
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,558
supposedly possessed

439
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,759
uh well when we were in high school the

440
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,678
exciting thing to do was to

441
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,279
drive up to red gate and try to scare

442
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,120
anybody that you could

443
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,200
the story was that

444
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,359
there was a man that had killed his

445
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,759
family up

446
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,038
some there

447
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,960
or another and

448
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,119
uh the story that i heard was that he

449
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,279
had painted the gate with blood that's

450
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,199
how the the name rygate came you know

451
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,240
red gate was you know

452
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,080
the place

453
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,038
the only place that i knew of that you

454
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:19,199
could go and just being in the place

455
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,000
being in that place being in the area

456
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,759
was a very spooky very scary

457
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
place to be

458
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:29,279
as with most urban legends the blood on

459
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,919
the gate story proved false

460
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,158
uh story of uh the blood on the gate and

461
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,120
all of this stuff i

462
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,000
i never had heard of that my whole life

463
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,439
growing up that particular story the

464
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,279
only thing i ever knew about were these

465
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,360
lights and everything

466
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,678
a check with the local sheriff showed

467
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,038
there was no record of such a crime

468
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,919
but something even stranger turned out

469
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,798
i'm scott f howard paul county sheriff

470
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,799
i have had

471
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,159
rumors are heard that other people in

472
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,038
the community have had

473
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,960
had encounters with ufos

474
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,319
does that go back over a period of gears

475
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,679
yes

476
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,879
most of the reports that i've heard have

477
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,480
been on the east side of deer lodge

478
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,200
i've heard of a spot that's been called

479
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,200
red gate on the east side of deer lodge

480
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
the sheriff directed me here to this

481
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,279
bakery owned by louis manicucci

482
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,519
louie and his family for many years

483
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:27,519
lived in the red gate area

484
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,879
boy did he have some stories to tell

485
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,119
just uh

486
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,080
it'd be just a circle

487
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,879
and then

488
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:37,759
down on the bottom here

489
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,520
is it's kind of concave sort of

490
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,919
well i wouldn't say if it's concave to

491
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,798
straight because it's always at night

492
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,880
okay and but around there is

493
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,240
all the way around this deal

494
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,520
is lights

495
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,359
they blink

496
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,079
all the way around like that they just

497
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,798
bring

498
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,439
in since it's in the night what is this

499
00:22:54,798 --> 00:23:00,158
is the big part all you can just see is

500
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,440
no all you can see is just a

501
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,440
uh glass just yeah just uh images

502
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
something it means a dark right with

503
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,279
this little ring

504
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,159
have you ever seen the top of one no

505
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,000
no

506
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,960
so this is right from looking up at the

507
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,599
ball right one time uh during the night

508
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,519
one let sat down and i climbed up the

509
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,918
mountain behind me and i went to peak up

510
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,200
over the top to you know to get a look

511
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,440
down in there

512
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,600
and i just about was 10 feet from the

513
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,600
top of the mountain and that sucker

514
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,200
gone

515
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,558
so

516
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,880
either they had like sensors or it could

517
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,038
be us it could be the united states it

518
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,159
could you know what i mean that's that's

519
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,158
what i kind of figured

520
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,278
that watering holes such as this that

521
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,639
form the center of the town's social

522
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,119
activity

523
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,120
as the night grows longer so do the

524
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,119
stories

525
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,919
stop and go comments that was well over

526
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,919
13 years ago i've been around 1991

527
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,480
and

528
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
just spotted

529
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,039
would look like

530
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
maybe it was a meteorite or a small

531
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,038
comet

532
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,798
but it didn't hang like a comet

533
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,359
it would move and get real bright kind

534
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,879
of leave a trail and it would stop

535
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,000
didn't move another direction stopped

536
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,480
and

537
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,480
did that

538
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,200
i don't know i guess three four five

539
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,400
minutes

540
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,798
and then

541
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,798
took off

542
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,079
you know i always watch the skies all

543
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,399
the time to see these lights

544
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,158
it was uh

545
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,960
dead silent

546
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,320
um

547
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
it was

548
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,759
it'd make your hair stand up on the back

549
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,599
of your neck and we'd go out there and

550
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,440
mess around and they tell the story on

551
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,158
the way up and it there's different

552
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,558
versions but it pretty much was the same

553
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,240
story with the blood on the gate and

554
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,599
they said that people's vehicles have

555
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,720
stalled

556
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,038
um

557
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,440
when we'd go and meet at

558
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,278
town palm for at the safeway's parking

559
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,320
lot that's where all high schools kids

560
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:19,359
met at

561
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,558
we would

562
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,918
say do you guys want to go up direct

563
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:24,960
i felt

564
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,759
a chill

565
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,720
down my spine and i was being watched i

566
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,879
didn't know

567
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,038
watched or stopped or

568
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
um

569
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,119
danger there's danger

570
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,759
it's

571
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,759
more than eerie it's uh

572
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,879
it even turns your stomach

573
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,480
yeah i mean when you get that deep

574
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,080
feeling like something right or you're

575
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,339
reading into somebody's

576
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,678
um

577
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:50,959
[Music]

578
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,240
psyche or what whatever it is it it you

579
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,759
could almost fall

580
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,079
it was so

581
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,240
in your gut like get out of where you're

582
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,240
at

583
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,720
some people told of interaction with

584
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,400
moving lights

585
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,600
mark denton and i grew up dear lodge

586
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,000
montana

587
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,000
about 1960-61

588
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,960
we're kind of riding around the car and

589
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,120
up near the emery mine

590
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,840
which is east side of town

591
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,359
we saw some lights

592
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,399
i was supposed to be one of the smart

593
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,759
science kids in in town and at first i

594
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,000
thought it might be a weather balloon

595
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,919
with a light shining off of it and it

596
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,679
was not so

597
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,278
one day we decided we'd chase the lights

598
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,960
to find out what it was

599
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,599
we're gonna get it we're gonna get it

600
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,519
hurry go go faster

601
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,519
we did that probably twice within a

602
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,440
three week period

603
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,278
go fast there was a light we did chase

604
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,960
it never caught it

605
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,960
i have heard a lot of the other stories

606
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,079
and so you know one can speculate from

607
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,759
there

608
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,839
at least two people remembered stories

609
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,278
of physical events involved with the

610
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,199
strange lights

611
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,079
tom gilbert recalled a story from high

612
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,919
school

613
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:02,199
my name is tom gilbert and i've lived

614
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,038
here all my life graduated

615
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,120
1965 from powell county high school

616
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,519
hey what can you tell us about the red

617
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,519
gate area well about

618
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,359
some light coming down and melting the

619
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,720
paint oh yeah we were good buddies

620
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:18,000
skipping it we worked together

621
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,759
you know

622
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,159
it seemed like the light just shined

623
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,038
right down on his car

624
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,360
and there was some mark in the paint

625
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,720
dave foster also remembered stories of

626
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,798
redgate

627
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
the story about redgate was and the

628
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,440
story that was related to me

629
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,798
was these guys had been up to red gate

630
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,240
and what they'd seen was some lights

631
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,759
coming down off the mountain and the

632
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,319
lights kind of stayed there a while and

633
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,798
then they moved around a little bit and

634
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,558
then they started coming at them real

635
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,639
fast and these two guys were with two

636
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,038
girls and uh

637
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,799
sitting out there and it kind of scared

638
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,720
them a little bit and the the lights

639
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,398
came to adam real fast there towards the

640
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,399
end and it just kind of popped went real

641
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,959
white and then that was it

642
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,398
and i guess when they got back to town

643
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,159
he was looking at the trunk piece car

644
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,439
and there was a little teeny burn mark

645
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,640
right in the back of the trunk of his

646
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,360
car and other than that there was

647
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,360
nothing at all

648
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,159
such stories didn't end in the 1960s and

649
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:20,720
70s they continue to this very day

650
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,360
brandon kent and josh garrison two local

651
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,000
students told us of their experience in

652
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,678
the summer of 2003.

653
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,200
we were driving along and

654
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,038
we saw a bright light kind of just

655
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,278
hanging up in the sky

656
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,839
and it confused us because it was there

657
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,440
was cloud cover and it was too bright to

658
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,199
be a star because it was there's been

659
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,200
even clouds it was on the other side of

660
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,120
the clouds on our side

661
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,159
and it just it hung there for a second

662
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,759
and then it uh it just like zipped down

663
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,840
into the ground

664
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,319
almost like it was crashing and then it

665
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:54,000
was right back in the exact same spot

666
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,439
and it just repeated that action and

667
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,599
then it just kind of disappeared we

668
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,600
didn't see it after it zipped down

669
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,038
the way back was like man what was that

670
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,879
because i mean we've never seen nothing

671
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,720
like that we but that was a falling star

672
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,240
but there's cloud cover unless it was

673
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,440
two of them falling in the exact same

674
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,599
way and it was actually looked like

675
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
another one dove down and one dove down

676
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,398
after it lit up

677
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,840
but it was definitely there was low

678
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:14,719
clouds it was definitely low to the

679
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,480
ground

680
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,240
and i shot down and i i'm up in that

681
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,079
area a lot hunting and never seen

682
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,919
nothing like that it wasn't a plane i

683
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,278
mean i'm flying planes a lot it wasn't a

684
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,679
plane

685
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,200
my dad's a pilot i know i know what they

686
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,880
look like going down and it was it was

687
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,480
just extremely fast

688
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,720
really bright light

689
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,038
we've heard of some urban legends of the

690
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,240
red gate up above there but it's more it

691
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,038
was is in that red gate area

692
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,038
almost like almost farther up the road

693
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,309
we kind of call it on the left hand side

694
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,519
of the road

695
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:47,038
[Music]

696
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,240
the east side of town up in the

697
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,158
mountains

698
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,640
up by the orpheno campground up towards

699
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,039
afino it was right it was on the front

700
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
side orfino in front of this mountain

701
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,158
i've never seen that the first time i'd

702
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,000
ever seen something like that like

703
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,840
something that you couldn't just

704
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,759
shake off you know that was a satellite

705
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,759
that was a star yeah we've seen some

706
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,119
i've seen some stuff in the sky but

707
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,879
nothing like that nothing beneath the

708
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,119
clouds and as bright and repeating

709
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,480
itself that fast dropping down within

710
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,879
that mountain

711
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,159
and i thought i was crazy but these i

712
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,159
didn't actually i didn't say anything at

713
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,080
first i just saw go down and then these

714
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,919
guys just whoa did you see that it was a

715
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,519
bright glow brighter than i've seen

716
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,278
before i mean it didn't light up the sky

717
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,119
it was just it was more like seeing the

718
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,200
sun drop down twice it was that bright

719
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,798
but it didn't it was almost like like if

720
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,600
someone had a bright spotlight in the

721
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:36,480
summer of 2003 just about a week and a

722
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:39,119
half ago it's july 30th today and

723
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,759
um me and my friends were out up by

724
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,000
orfino and we were driving out

725
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,919
and we saw a light out in the field so

726
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,278
we stopped and we started looking at it

727
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,200
and one of my friends is like well

728
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,480
that's moving around and we're just like

729
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,240
whatever man we don't really pay

730
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,599
attention and then we started looking at

731
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,519
we all started noticing that it was

732
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,038
moving around down the field and kind of

733
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,398
roundabout ways we're not really sure

734
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:59,200
what about

735
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,918
so

736
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,840
we look at it an hour passes or so and

737
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,600
we start driving down the road and we're

738
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,359
going pretty fast and we're all just

739
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,599
staring at the light

740
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,439
in amazement watching it move like what

741
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,240
is that what could it be

742
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
so

743
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,519
we go up and we're driving along the

744
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,798
road we almost hit deer and stuff but

745
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,480
we're not paying attention to that we're

746
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,359
paying attention to the light

747
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,759
and um we pass it we come back we park

748
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,519
and we're pretty close probably about i

749
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,119
don't know i i say it was pretty close

750
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,079
but my friends say it was about a mile

751
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,918
away but

752
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,519
i think it was closer than that and the

753
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,399
light was about

754
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,000
this big

755
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,439
from where we could see it

756
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,278
and it looked like it was going around

757
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,399
on a rotating disc almost there's three

758
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,480
of them

759
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,959
hoping to gather more information linda

760
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,079
turned to a once secret u.s army

761
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,919
intelligence gathering process

762
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,599
it's called remote viewing

763
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,679
my name is lynn buchanan i'm from

764
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,599
alamogordo new mexico

765
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,600
i was one of the

766
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,599
government's controlled remote viewers

767
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,599
for eight and a half years

768
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,480
and for the last seven and a half years

769
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,119
of my time in service

770
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,919
i was the trainer of the unit

771
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:10,239
most people think that control you know

772
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,240
controlled remote viewing is

773
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,759
the equivalent of being psychic

774
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,399
actually it's not

775
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,240
what the government wanted was

776
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,959
a method that could be taught to the

777
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,798
dumbest grunt soldier and have him

778
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,679
tell his commander what was over the

779
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:25,440
hill

780
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,840
and where to point the guns

781
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,120
and so

782
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,278
they

783
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,759
started off with

784
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,440
those people who had natural

785
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,599
psychic ability

786
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,159
however

787
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,398
in the end i know our last viewer had

788
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,640
just been picked at random out of the

789
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,319
military's personnel computer

790
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,480
a lot of people

791
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,678
look on the internet for remote viewing

792
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,360
and what they find is pure psychic stuff

793
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,200
controlled remote viewing was the

794
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,158
scientific process that was developed

795
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
at

796
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,640
developed in the laboratory and used by

797
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,200
the government and the military

798
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,759
in essence

799
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,640
the subconscious mind tends to be very

800
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,919
psychic but the conscious mind is not

801
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,840
psychic at all

802
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,840
and so the controlled remote viewing

803
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,119
process is simply one

804
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,879
where you set up a line of

805
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,359
communications

806
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,880
between the subconscious mind and the

807
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,839
conscious mind

808
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,840
that way you can

809
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,320
have a line of communications where you

810
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,599
can ask the subconscious specific

811
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,480
questions

812
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:37,038
and you can get back specific answers

813
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,960
from the subconscious mind

814
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,599
of course the obvious question for your

815
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,480
purposes is whether or not this can be

816
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:47,519
used to answer the ufo question

817
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,120
the answer is yes we answer questions if

818
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,120
you have a question

819
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:55,839
about some ufo event or some ufo landing

820
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,599
site or some abduction

821
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,599
we can find out

822
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,639
whether or not the

823
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,719
the memory of that was false memory or

824
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,278
whether it was an actual event and that

825
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,320
has happened uh

826
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,159
if it's

827
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,440
true we can find out what actually

828
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,000
happened

829
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,519
beyond the things that the abductee

830
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,398
remembers

831
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,039
if

832
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:22,078
it's a false memory we can find out what

833
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:25,599
happened to cause that false memory

834
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,919
and so therefore this is actually a tool

835
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,280
for finding information but you've got

836
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,598
to remember that we go by the database

837
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,639
we had many individuals within the

838
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,599
government

839
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,599
who asked us

840
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,720
about ufo questions and we wound up

841
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,480
doing a good amount of ufo work on our

842
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,638
own

843
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,760
for questions that which were asked us

844
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,838
by individuals within the government and

845
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,440
it was unofficial tasking

846
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,239
so i i am picking my words very closely

847
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,320
here

848
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,719
the government

849
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,920
never officially task us with any ufo

850
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,279
questions

851

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,119
we did a sizable amount and actually

853
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,480
wind up

854
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,760
still doing it

855
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,639
sometimes for individuals

856
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,640
within the government

857
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,800

858
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,599
professional remote viewer

859
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,560
in 1995 i was trained by a retired

860
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,000
military remote viewer in controlled

861
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:36,320
remote viewing and then in early 1996 i

862
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,320
was trained in scientific remote viewing

863
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,719
i'm d leslie i'm a trained professional

864
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,720
remote viewer

865
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,239
and i'm director of instruction with

866
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:50,000
farsight institute which is a

867
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,000
not-for-profit organization

868
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,880
a double-blind remote viewing session is

869
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,480
a session wherein the viewer just not

870
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,039
only has no clue what the target is but

871
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,240
the person who is monitoring them

872
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:11,039
has no idea what the target is either so

873
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:14,319
your viewer and your monitor

874
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,079
are not front loaded at all the only

875
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,880
thing the monitor has

876
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,880
are the two four digit coordinates

877
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,480
in this particular project the

878
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,079
coordinates were given

879
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,960
by someone else that did not know what

880
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,359
the target was

881
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,000
anyone involved in the viewing of these

882
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:37,440
targets had no idea or had no

883
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,440
information about the target

884
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,839

895
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,639

children and an et

897
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:37,239
there was not any fear

898
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,239
it was a casual encounter

899
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:43,279
these subjects

900
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,279

909
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,799
possible fakery connected to such

910
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,639
accounts some of the major witnesses in

911
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
the red gate case were submitted to a

912

polygraph examination

913
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,960
the lie detector showed no evidence of

914
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,960
deception by anyone no

teenager driving late at night

919
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:30,319
with two friends

920
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,320

and down the back road and uh

924
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,240
we uh

925
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,839
went around the corner heading down

926
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,519
the back road and a bright light

927
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,039
appeared in the back in the rearview

928
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,000
mirror

929
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,880

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,559
got very bright very fast

932
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,479
and uh

933
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,119
that's kind of where it all

934
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,119
and this was in 1962

immediately

938
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,358
they looked in the back and was coming

939
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,839
at such a high rate of speed and we

940
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,598
couldn't explain what was going on

941
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,078
so um

942
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,760
well they just jumped in the back seat

943

kind of panicked a little bit and kind

944

1024
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:18,639
pulsing

1025
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,079
okay i've got a sketch

1026
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,078
let's see what we have

1027
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,839
all right and i've got subject

1028
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,239
and

1029
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,239
another one

1030
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,280
strange another one here

1031
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:44,399
okay it's some kind of a

1032
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,399
tube-like thing

1033
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,358
such unworldly experiences didn't end

1034
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,279
with just linda's friends

1035
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,719
whatever it was seemed to move through

1036
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,119
families including her own

1037
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:00,639
well my name is doug cronquist

1038
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,880
and i was born 1946

1039
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,000
and i called deerlodge home

1040
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,000
it would have to be between

1041
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,759
probably

1042
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:15,279
15 52 i suppose

1043
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,680
i was born 46 50 make me four 52 would

1044
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,800
make me six years old somewhere's in

1045
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,838
there that

1046
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,400
there was a witch that was standing on

1047
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:23,759
me

1048
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,079
but

1049
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,319
i don't you know and it was i was scared

1050
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,440
and terrified and whatnot but i was

1051
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,358
under foot

1052
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,720
i was being stood on and i don't and

1053
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:35,199
that's all i remember is just being

1054
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,598
stood on by this witch and

1055
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,759
why'd you have the idea it was a wheel i

1056
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,160
probably had no idea what else to call

1057
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,319
it i mean

1058
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:48,318
in montana 1950

1059
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,838
you know we didn't we didn't really even

1060
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:53,838
have buck rogers that was a city thing

1061
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:56,400
we didn't have things like that we had

1062
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,759
cowboys and indians and you know we had

1063
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,440
halloween

1064
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,000
we didn't have

1065
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,000
buck rogers that was

1066
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,239
that was things that were strange to us

1067
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,760
i remember asking my brother several

1068
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,189
times and to the point where he was mad

1069
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,800
at me uh steve what's a skyscraper

1070
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,960
[Music]

1071
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,560
my wife and i went to

1072
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,679
area 51

1073
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:22,679
it was in august of

1074
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:22,679
19 1994.

1075
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,199
that night it was just starting to get

1076
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,720
dark and it was extremely loud not loud

1077
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,279
but bright

1078
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,279
flash off to our right which would be

1079
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,960
over towards uh

1080
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,040
the racial direction over that away

1081
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,119
which i'm i would say right now would be

1082
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,159
north i'm not sure as to my compass

1083
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,800
points but

1084
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:45,440
off to our right north just a huge

1085
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,640
bright flash but no sound

1086
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,838
and

1087
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,838
later in the evening we'd seen

1088
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:52,480
lights

1089
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:57,519
just zipping across the sky or

1090
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,279
or whatever

1091
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,559
during a visit back to montana some

1092
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,720
years ago linda's own son had an unusual

1093
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,960
daytime experience

1094
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:09,118
back in the early 80s i was 12 or 13

1095
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,720
years old and i

1096
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,519
accompanied my mother to dear lodge

1097
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:15,439
montana for a class reunion my sister

1098
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:19,199
and i both went with her during this

1099
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,200
time we were out playing volleyball

1100
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,760
you hit it like a girl

1101
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,199
oh really

1102
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,839
it was very

1103
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:36,159
astonishing to me to see such a thing

1104
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,559
at first i thought it was a toy

1105
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:41,759
do you see that

1106
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,119
i turned around to my sister and i said

1107
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,640
did you see that

1108
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,000
where did it go

1109
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,400
and as soon as i turned around it was

1110
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,400
gone

1111
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:54,399
after that time my sister and i never

1112
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:56,000
really spoke about it

1113
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,880
never really had any discussions about

1114
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,800
it

1115
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,800
just just random recollection

1116
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,119
it was so clear that i was thinking if

1117
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,119
it was a toy

1118
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,039
then how can it be that big and be so

1119
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,640
far away

1120
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,400
must be really big what did it look like

1121
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:20,078
the gray

1122
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,760
gray grayish metallic

1123
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,839
wasn't shiny

1124
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,400
it was

1125
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:27,920
dull

1126
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:31,920
and it slanted up it was round

1127
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,920
and then slanted up from the sides

1128
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:37,880
and kind of went in and had another

1129
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,879
little top on top of it

1130
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:42,000
i don't know if there's vents on the

1131
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,318
bottom

1132
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,838
circular

1133
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:47,838
like fan things

1134
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,400
i turned them back to her and i said i

1135
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,680
think we just saw ufo that was really

1136
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,880
weird

1137
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,879
she's like yeah that's cool

1138
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,480
p4 and a half

1139
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,519
there seems

1140
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,400
to be

1141
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,679
a

1142
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,639
male

1143
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,879
and female

1144
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,519
subjects

1145
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,519
they're human

1146
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,119
be p4 and a half

1147
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,119
there's an

1148
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,318
object

1149
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,318
slash structure

1150
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,000
behind

1151
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,000
and above

1152
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:38,159
the subjects

1153
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,400
p4 and a half

1154
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,640
there are

1155
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:49,639
none

1156
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,960
subjects

1157
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:57,598
in the object

1158
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,880
i think in this session what i picked up

1159
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,720
were a male and female

1160
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,480
and they're engaged in some sort of

1161
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,480
outdoor activity

1162
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,159
and then they see something in the sky

1163
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,039
that's behind them and it's high above

1164
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,879
them

1165
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,880
what happens is that they see a

1166
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,880
spaceship

1167
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,159
linda's son said a few years later he

1168
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:21,920
had an experience that was even more

1169
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,480
disturbing there was one occasion

1170
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,480
specifically that i recall

1171
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,920
where i was lying in bed

1172
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,838
and

1173
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:35,280
i was in that type of sleep that was not

1174
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,679
really asleep but not really away

1175
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,839
i saw this

1176
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,919
black

1177
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,440
shadowy figure

1178
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,519
coming towards me on the right side of

1179
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,559
my bed

1180
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:50,880
the figure itself wasn't scary at all

1181
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,880
but it was scary the fact that

1182
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,559
it was advancing towards me it felt like

1183
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,838
it was coming towards me to touch me and

1184
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:00,880
to reach out and grab me it had a

1185
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:03,039
squarish type

1186
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,318
head if you want to call it

1187
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:06,159
um

1188
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:07,599
and the rest of it it looked like some

1189
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:09,279
sort of

1190
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,200
human shape

1191
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,680

they come from off-world there's no

00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:47,358
this seems to happen mainly at night

1251
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,838
and there's some type of black fuzziness

1252

associated with this event and it seems

1253
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,599
to be indoors in a bedroom

1254
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,960
she met with her brother steve and dear

1255

lodge recently and they took me along as

1256
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,960
they retraced their steps to the place

1257

00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:10,559
came flooding back

1261
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,920

1262
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,118
way out of the country kind of hillbilly

1263

she got up late one night to get a glass

1298

of water and she looked outside and saw

1299
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,240
this bright light so she went to the

1300
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:35,680
window to look out and she saw this

1301
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:36,838
which she described as a football shaped

1302
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,480

1306
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,359
a little bit and then she

1307
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,358
called for my uncle and and told him to

and they went out on their front porch

1310
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,159
and stood there and watched it

1311
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,039

she started talking and talking and

01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:58,000
talking

1425
01:00:54,079 --> 01:01:00,240
and monopolized the whole conversation

and

1427
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:04,639
it was almost like she'd known them a

1428
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,640
long time also

1429
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:09,118
except she hadn't

1430
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:11,759
that was her very first time

1431
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,000
uh

1432
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,960

1433
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,519
any other time meeting them but about

1434

three weeks after that

1435
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,599
my sister came up and said

just

1442
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,880
thoroughly disgusted that she would

1443
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:38,960

1444
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,480

and

1447
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,679
i just assumed that maybe it was that

1448
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,358
day or the day before but

1449
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:52,159

1458

appeared to me to be a female

encountered looked very much like a

grasshopper and that's why i called her

what the marks were on my arms and

i don't remember why

1688
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,640
she just saw the ones on my arms but

1689
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,320
i said i didn't know

1690
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,480
and

1691
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:33,359
she sent me to the principal

01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,959
and to the nurse and then called my

01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:40,880

didn't know how they'd gotten there

it was really interesting because they

extremely painful at the beginning

1711
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,719
and they would be like blisters and they

1712
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,520

be

1716
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:34,480
would have to wear things to keep this

these sessions one thing that has come

1784
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:24,800
through for me in all of the sessions is

1785
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:28,000
it's the air the climate is just very

1786

charged it's electrified

01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:38,800
doing a session where you pick up

01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,120
something that's glassy

1792
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:44,079
that has depth to it it just makes me

1793
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:46,238
think of a portal we may be in an area

later in

1847
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,920
life there's a very strong possibility

01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:42,880
that this

1849
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,880
that this was

a suggestion of theirs that i had no

need to talk about

1852
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:54,479
well the ufos i believe that

1853
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:56,000
non-human life extraterrestrials have

1854

been here all along

1855
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,760

1856
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,679
out of it

1857
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,960
um don't understand a lot of the secrecy

1858
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,199
behind it but for me i think they're a

1859
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,439
part of our daily lives on many areas

1860
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:10,799
some are physical some are in different

dimensions

01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,560
some are

1863
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:16,238
good some are not so good a lot of them

1864
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,960
are like people

1865
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:21,039
basically they're not better than us

1866

they're simply different

1867
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:24,479
my thought about ufos is that they're

1868
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,840
becoming more and more prevalent in our

01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,360
we are hearing more stories about ufos

1871
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:35,279
and it's through remote viewing

1872
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:39,439
that we are able to actually perceive

1873
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:40,880
and better explain the ufo phenomena

1874
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:42,960
i think we're in a time when our

1875
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,279
consciousness is expanding

1876
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,279
and it's expanding so that we're able to

my personal opinion of ufos and

1885
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:05,359
subjects who claim to have seen ufos

1886

is

1887
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:09,839
that i'm certainly open to the

1888
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:11,520
wide possibility that these are real

1889

phenomena

1890
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,000
proving this

1891
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,800
as a scientist is difficult

1892
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,840
but

1893
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,880
so many honest and honorable and decent

put you in jail or

you know be on a jury and

1900

give you a life sentence and we would

believe them in these circumstances

i believe these people

01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:43,198
have had

1904
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:46,000
ufo experiences or certainly they

1905

believe they have had ufo experiences

with as big as the universe is

1907
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:52,238
there's no reason to think there isn't

the redgate project is impressive for a

1912
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:02,719
variety of reasons the researchers are

1913
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,880
good people who have used professional

approaches in their investigative

interviews

1916
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:12,479
they've used remote viewing

hypnosis sessions polygraph sessions

1918
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:16,559
and they're combining their efforts with

1919
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:18,079
good people from a community that seems

1920
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,000
to be supportive

1921
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:21,359
of letting this information come into

that their experiences

1927
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,399
are important to them and in my opinion

1928
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:37,319
important to the rest of us i'm pleased

um

1932
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:44,560
i think the message is to not continue

1933
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,238
to search in our past

1934
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:50,159
but to grow

1935
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:52,959
and get beyond what's happened and to

1936
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:55,119
understand that it's just a part of our

1937
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,158
life and that we just need to

1938
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:58,880
um

1939
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:01,519
learn from it and move on and

1940
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,760
explore what you learn

1941
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:06,000
after all her searching linda crew has

1942
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,199
finally accepted the reality of her

1943

experiences

people in one small american community
