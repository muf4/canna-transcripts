14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,160

smoke weed as much as I wanted yeah and

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,680
uh happen upon overgrow.com and it's

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,799
kind of saw the blueprint there so uh

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,680
you know a lot of people were real

44
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,600
sketched out early on when they found

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,000
overgrow like worried like should I post

46

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,159
weird but I you know I didn't lo I

49

um I didn't post for a long time yeah

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,600
and then eventually I just had some

52
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,039
burning questions I needed to ask and uh

53
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,840

super helpful very helpful tool for

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,080
starting yeah I think that's kind of how

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,959
we all got our little like people just

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,120
kind of slowly step into the forums when

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,400
they first get there it's like do I

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,640
really want to engage some of these

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,560
people are kind of

61
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:26,039

um I I loved looking at the pictures

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,919
that's that's one of the things that

67
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,759
really drew me there can you think what

68
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,799
kind of strains were popular at the time

69
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,479
when you were hitting ogrow the the two

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,519
that I remember the most are sweet tooth

71
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,079
number three from breeder Steve and and

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,400
Cinderella 99 from Brothers Grim those

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,719
were those were very popular and

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,680
everybody was raving about them yeah

75
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,560
definitely at the tops of spice of life

76
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,480
and uh Brothers Grim was very early too

77
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,199
yeah

78
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,719
and and looking back on it all that

79
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:08,560
spice life stuff was great um big

80
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,639
yielding Frosty plants great smells easy

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,039

82
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,679
grow um he he had some good stuff there

83
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,079
yeah yeah he really did and then later

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,080
on with Legends too did you ever get you

85
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,719

87
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,878
pretty sure I did grow that one I mean

88
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:32,080
it's very similar to to Sweet Tooth yeah

89
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:35,759
just a big cner Cola mold

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,480
prone um big yielding Frosty fruity

91
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:44,959
smelling yeah yeah yeah that's great I

92
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:47,000
actually um skipping ahead 20 years um

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,840
somebody showed me some Northern Lights

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,919
5 that you guys did he he flowered some

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,519
out and the smells I was getting off

96
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,679
that Northern Lights was very

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,680
reminiscent of Sweet Tooth oh

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,959
wow in a long time that's cool dude

99
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,640
that's cool so let's let's whip it back

100
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,360
around to how long have you been kind of

101
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:17,120
um working inside the legal system of

102
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:20,799
candidates the legal part um let's see

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:26,000
California passed prop

104
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:31,799
64 in the end of 16 I voted no on it um

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,959
as as most most people did up here yeah

106
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,439
uh so then 17 the county came through

107
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,478
with structure

108
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:44,360
to become legal within the county to

109
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,000
become registered so I did that and that

110
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,960
kept the county off my back which was

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,879
the biggest fear sure

112
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:57,198
um at the time uh and uh then in 18 the

113
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,199
State

114
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:03,519
Licensing State Licensing thing came

115
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:06,680
online so January 18 I I submitted my

116
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:11,120
application yeah and uh sort of bit the

117
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,879
bullet and and went for it and what have

118
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,079
you been growing recently during that

119
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,120
time do you only have with California's

120
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,719
medical scene I know in a lot of other

121
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,038
places you can only grow what they allow

122
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,160
you to grow inside their thing is it

123
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,519
does it work like that um well I

124
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,120
transition well it the the license the

125
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:34,279
county allow me for 10,000 square feet

126
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,360
of flowering canopy yeah which was maybe

127
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,839
a slight reduction of what I had been

128
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,120
doing

129
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,719
previously um and I had to change things

130
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,680
around I had to I I had a big flat up on

131
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,720
a hill I I basically abandoned and and

132
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,439
and came down to the valley floor uh one

133
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
because I felt more comfortable kind of

134
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,519
being out in the open down there and

135
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
then two it was just just for

136
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,839
regulations and stuff it was going to be

137
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,758
easier to operate plus I have I have

138
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:05,198
power down there there and I did not

139
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:09,240
have power up on the hillside yeah so it

140
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,759
just made a lot of things easier um and

141
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,478
I I kind of abandoned outdoor growing um

142
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,960
and converted everything into green

143
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,879
houses to light dep all my square

144
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,478
footage yeah I I had always felt like

145
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,879
light de was the future um yeah it makes

146
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:28,000
sense pulling off two crops getting that

147
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,079
first crop out the door and and kind of

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,160
like you know getting some r Vue coming

149
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,680
in instead of uh instead of just

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,240
hemorrhaging money until you know God

151
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,319
knows when you might actually get paid

152
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,000
you know the outdoor I usually just sat

153
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,960
on for a few months anyways after the

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,519
season and having a big depth would

155
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,279
allow you to do that and and not need to

156
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,159
make a fire sale what's your thoughts on

157
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,959
like uh it's kind of random tangent but

158
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,080
uh autoflowering versus light dep like

159
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,598
as far

160
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,478
as like being able to run those multiple

161
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,680
Cycles is one more advantageous than the

162
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,079
other you

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,598
think I mean you're going to be you can

164
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,639
grow a r wider range of what's popular

165
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,560
with light dep yeah with Autoflower I

166
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,199
mean I know they've come a long

167
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,759
way um with an outdoor license you used

168
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,000
to not be able to pull tarp on an

169
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:25,919
outdoor license but now you can wow yeah

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,240
um but I'm in the mountains I have some

171
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,680
elevation uh it's it would be tough to

172
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,639
pull off to

173
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,959
I can't start very early outdoors and I

174
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,519
can't can't go very late Outdoors so

175
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,439
trying to pull off two crops Outdoors

176
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,079
without tarp like maybe an Autoflower

177
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,478
crop in the spring summer and then

178
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:47,158
replant with something fullterm

179
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,360
um that would be tough for me to to to

180
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:52,879
squeeze in

181
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
and um well this all goes back to

182
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,840
probably what we're going to talk about

183
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,679
in a little bit is market demand too

184
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,158
right like because it's driving the

185
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,199
market what if an Autoflower might

186
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:05,038
actually work it doesn't necessarily

187
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,598
mean that it will work in the market

188
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,800
right right and and the Market's

189
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,399
competitive super competitive and

190
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,158
growing from seed you're going to have

191
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,478
some variation and and and and figuring

192
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:19,038
out which seed is good stuff to run and

193
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:23,038
then getting a ton of it because you're

194
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:25,598
going to run High numbers um it's just

195
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,399
that was you know when the price when

196
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,038
the price was higher and and things were

197
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:32,158
not competitive had I had an out store

198
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:34,240
license I definitely would have schemed

199
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,718
it up because then you can plant your

200
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,839
autos and then in between your Autos you

201
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,560
can plant your full-term stuff and get

202
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,000
those some veg time early before you

203
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:48,199
actually chop so yeah what were we

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,399
talking about um let's move into uh how

205
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,839
you got started like uh on the forums

206
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,919
maybe you touch on the bog

207
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,360
stuff okay so on overgrow when I found

208
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,759
it uh bog was posting like great

209
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,079
pictures of of the plants he was growing

210
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:07,159
and he would post the he had these like

211
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,838
long running threads of uh keep it

212
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,078
simple stupid how to how to start

213
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,519
growing and his methods were really

214
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:16,719
simple and he would chime in every now

215
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,240
and then if you had a question

216
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,920
and

217
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,240
um that's I basically just copied his

218
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:27,199
formula on my first grow and uh it

219
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,278
worked well and I was grow I grew I

220
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,240
bought some sweet tooth number three

221
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:35,240
seeds um

222
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,839
from Gypsy but I forget what the PL

223
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,240
seeds direct or something like that yeah

224
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,920
and

225
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,200
uh did did it did great it grew great

226
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:47,240
weed too and his his formula was so

227
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,120
simple it was just a rich soil mix uh

228
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,320
blood

229
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:58,200
meal U bone meal uh lime green sand kelp

230
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,879
worm castings and then just using a pure

231
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,000
blend original

232
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:08,278
um ferments yeah and

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,039
uh man I grew great weed it it was it

234
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,399
was

235
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:14,439
outstanding and like knowing what I know

236
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,240
now I veered away from it over time you

237
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,040
know and experimented with other stuff

238
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,240
and salts and and eventually came back

239
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,759
to rich soil mix compost

240
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,480
teas um I don't do ferments but I

241
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,439
certainly will be experimenting with

242
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
that in the

243
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,120
future um because you can make them

244
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,480
really cheap on site yeah and uh that's

245
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
uh that saved some money but like

246
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,039
feeding feeding the microbes having a

247
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,800
rich soil and feeding the microbes just

248
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:46,399
to me just grows Stellar pot every time

249
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,278
even if you screw it up yeah um it just

250
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,839
it just it's it's tough to beat it's

251
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:52,639
tough to beat and its scale like I don't

252
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,760
like going to the store and buying tons

253
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,200
of spending tons of of money on on

254
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,600
nutrients organic or otherwise yeah

255
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,360
right yeah know so I feel like if I can

256
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,800
just mix it into my soil in the spring

257
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,278
you know after a soil test um and add

258
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,919
water like that's ideal yeah I came in

259
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:15,278
during a much um different time like as

260
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,319
far as nutrients and the hydro store

261
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:21,159
boom and all that stuff so when I came

262
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,000
in like I was really I had to go through

263
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,838
the the time of understanding that it

264
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,639
was like a used car lot and the guys

265
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,320
that that work in the hydro store aren't

266
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,320
really Growers I had to go through that

267
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,040
and like trying to play Magic magician

268
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,440
with all the different nutrient bottles

269
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:37,159
because I was pretty sure one was going

270
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
to finally make it more DK than the

271
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,399
others you know so it's cool to hear

272
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,399
someone that you know started with

273
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,600
something super simple and and didn't

274
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,480
have to go through that crap yeah that

275
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,480
was that was the wisdom in bogs thread

276
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,360
on his

277
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,079
howto and I mean he started way before

278
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,600
all that yeah and like I kind of did too

279
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,838
there weren't a whole lot of options in

280
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,720
in too like there are now or like there

281
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,320
were five years later yeah and I know

282
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,720
it's something I commonly see with

283
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,720
people like something's wrong in their

284
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,440
grow so they think it's their nutrient

285
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,440
line and it's like no it's it's not your

286
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,880
nutrient line like there's some other

287
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,120
variable it's all the same [ __ ] in those

288
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:25,399
bottles yes all marketing same company

289
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,919
making it for different compan pick pick

290
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,159
one and dial it in and dial it in for

291
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,240
the strain yeah it's it's not your

292
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,000
nutrients whatever's wrong in your thing

293
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,159
it's it's not the nutrients the

294
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,120
nutrients are probably fine just figure

295
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:44,078
it out yeah

296
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,000
exactly and um you know I I I've been

297
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,719
watching your Instagram live feeds and I

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,120
highly recommend other people like

299
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:55,800
follow it's uh is it _ Hill cultivators

300
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,198
yes on Instagram and it's been some of

301
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,519
the more um fascinating content I've

302
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,159
seen in a long time time I watch it

303
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,679
every time you upload something and uh

304
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,319
you know the other day you were talking

305
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,879
about specifically the legal market and

306
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,399
not knowing exactly where your flowers

307
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,958
go or where direct people to get them or

308
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,600
what name they'll be under I thought it

309
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,278
was totally

310
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,639
fascinating yeah so the way the legal

311
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,639
Market set up

312
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,159
is everything a cultivator sell has to

313
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,679
move through distribution sort of like

314
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:34,399
same as alcohol in California

315
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:38,039
um sort of sort of sort of like alcohol

316
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,120
um there's some exceptions uh I I can't

317
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,439
sell direct to consumer or direct to

318
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,720
retail I have to move it through a

319
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,399
distributor who then sells it

320
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,800
to another distributor or a brand that's

321
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,440
a distributor or has a license with a

322
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:58,159
distributor and they sell it to retail

323
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,199
yeah and so I don't most of the time I

324
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,399
don't know where my flower ends up I

325
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:03,799
don't know who ends up buying it I don't

326
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,958
know what brand it's in I don't know

327
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:08,319
what stores it's in and that disconnect

328
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,879
and a lot of the time the distributor I

329
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,320
move it through doesn't know either yeah

330
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,838
and so like I'm kind of used to that

331
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,519
since back in the day you didn't really

332
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,279
ask yeah but now it's like okay like

333
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,879
people are hitting me up like trying to

334
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:26,759
find my flower or or they like my feed

335
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:30,240
and they want to you know support me or

336
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:32,519
or see you know I actually good weed and

337
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,440
yeah and like I've got also at the same

338
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,600
time I've gotten great feedback from the

339
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,839
one store up here in NorCal that

340
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,000
actually attaches the farmer's name to

341
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:47,279
the to the produce they buy um organic

342
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,159
can and mocan in Santa Santa Rosa and

343
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,278
Hopland they are retail but they also

344
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,278
have distribution for themselves yeah so

345
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,198
they're able to buy wholesale they

346
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,799
package it but they keep the farm name

347
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:03,399
and logo with the product so when you're

348
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,240
looking on their menu you see all the

349
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,958
farm names yeah next to the strain

350
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,799
that's amazing and that's that's super

351
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,278
cool and and they're one of the few

352
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,039
places that do that and to me it's a

353
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,439
no-brainer but I mean other people don't

354
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,919
get it you know like you don't just see

355
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,320
you don't you don't walk into like a

356
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:24,439
wine store and just buy cab or buy Mero

357
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,839
you you you see the vineyard or you see

358
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,920
the winery where it's made and the

359
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,199
location and all those things about it

360
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,360
and and so that's a cool thing that they

361
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,639
do so just off of those three pounds I

362
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,519
sell them a year um I'll I'll get one or

363
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,680
two people hitting me up saying hey man

364
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,600
this was great I bet you know and and

365
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,439
and and they appreciate it and I'm I'm

366
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,879
stoked to hear that and I think they're

367
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,600
stoked to know that they're actually

368
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,639
talking to me the grower and it's not

369
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,399
some

370
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:58,198
like you know social media sure you know

371
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,159
person running running the social media

372
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:03,039
yeah that happens a lot too that happens

373
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,360
a lot too yeah yeah I mean I'm it's my

374
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,399
operation is just me I mean I have help

375
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,800
but like it's it's just me there's

376
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,559
there's no team in the sense that like

377
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,039
it's my business and and I I mean I

378
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,838
certainly have help on the farm

379
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:22,599
absolutely and and I couldn't do it

380
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,040
without him but um like there there's no

381
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,360
administra Administrative Office it's

382
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,519
it's my living room table you know yeah

383
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,159
exactly yeah

384
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,959
yeah that's wild to me man like just we

385
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,958
we did an episode recently we called the

386
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,879
name game just about like trying to

387
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,838
explain to endlevel Consumers that maybe

388
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,240
aren't as nerdy about strains and don't

389
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:46,120
grow and aren't as died into growing try

390
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,959
to find a way to reach across to them to

391
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,198
to for them to understand like look if

392
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,078
you want to know exactly what you're

393
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,919
smoking and use it as medicine you have

394
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,399
to be a lot more aware of what Farm's

395
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:57,838
making it you need consistency you need

396
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,919
you know reliability and all of that

397
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,560
just all of that was so missing in

398
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,078
what's going on right now and I don't

399
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:06,480
know how they can rationalize this as a

400
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,918
medical system when there's nothing

401
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,480
medical about not being able to give

402
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:15,160
reputable reliable results yeah AB

403
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,038
absolutely there's you can change the

404
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,319
strain name anytime you want at at any

405
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,798
at any stage through the through the

406
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:26,438
cycle you

407
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:29,558
can um a brand can be buying a strain

408
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:33,240
and run out and buy either if they can't

409
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,480
Source the same strain they'll if it was

410
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,000
a good seller they'll just throw

411
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,839
something else in that bag under that

412
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,759
name yeah I watched it happen as a brand

413
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:44,359
like I don't know how that's good

414
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,879
business you know um who knows man and

415
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,558
even if they do find the same strain

416
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,559
it's probably from a different

417
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:54,000
grower and so then now there's varying

418
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:55,519
qualities and and and and and is it

419
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,400
actually the same strain did they think

420
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,519
it's the same strain as one you know

421
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,919
grown Inland is one grown Coastal is one

422
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,679
grown organic is one grown

423
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,000
differently um you you don't know and

424
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,720
they say like you know in the farm to

425
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,359
table type type atmosphere like know

426
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,960
your grower like yeah know where your

427
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:20,479
food comes from well know where your

428
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,798
weed comes from and exactly um that's I

429
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,120
mean I'm a farmer right so I'm super

430
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,038
biased but like to me that's a

431
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,918
no-brainer do I know where all my food

432
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,839
comes from no but like I know my meat

433
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,080
comes from I know where my eggs come

434
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:36,359
from yeah and and I like that and I and

435
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,678
I like the fact that I'm supporting my

436
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:41,399
neighbors with that as opposed to you

437
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,038
know some [ __ ] in Missouri or

438
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,200
somewhere you know with a billion

439
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:46,440
dollars in a bunch of different

440
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,960
companies that doesn't really give a

441
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,240
[ __ ] besides looking at the the the

442
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,600
profit report you know yeah I I had this

443
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,519
experience the other day when we bought

444
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,439
some Louis OG and this is when I was

445
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,918
doing my little experiment to see like

446
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,400
if if dispensaries in Bakersville

447
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,038
because you know Bakersville sucks dude

448
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,480
like this is the the worst place in

449
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,319
California for weed ever and there's no

450
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,759
connoisseur quality anything but I

451
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,240
wanted to see what dispensaries had to

452
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,519
offer and my um my lady liked the Louis

453
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,880
OG we got it was an OG it was a good OG

454
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,679
I don't know if it was Loui but it was a

455
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,679
good OG yeah so two days later called

456
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,120
the same

457
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:25,840
place deliver the same stuff again get

458
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:27,918
it it's a a berry like a berry um

459
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,038
Gorilla Glue this time but it's label

460
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,480
Lou

461
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,359
and so of course I hit him up I'm like

462
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,599
bro this is not even close to the same

463
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:36,839
thing they're like yeah different

464
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:40,119
phenotypes bro sorry you know like

465
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:42,558
phenotype speak to me bro it's it's such

466
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:45,918
horseshit yeah it's horrible it didn't

467
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:48,359
make any sense yeah they I mean that's

468
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,080
funny because node Labs had a picture of

469
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:55,558
their OG Kush on their Instagram and the

470
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,439
picture is is is Gorilla Glue like yeah

471
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,000
everybody knows it and I chimed in a

472
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,798
bunch of other people know chimed him

473
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,400
like dude that's gorilla goo like it's

474
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,038
it's obvious that's not an OG and yeah

475
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,600
what do they know like it's just some

476
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,960
person around their social media they

477
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,719
don't know anything funny is you should

478
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,319
mention weed shitty and

479
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,200
Bakersfield um for a while up here this

480
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:19,879
was years and years ago when you had a

481
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:22,000
bag of uh not so great uh OG kush yeah

482
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,559
um the joke was to call it Bakersfield

483
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,599
OG that's [ __ ]

484
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,200
great Tahoe or San Fernando Valley or

485
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,959
whatever it like oh this looks like

486
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,600
Bakersfield OG exactly this is a it's a

487
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,319
weird spot like people not from

488
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,678
California don't quite understand how

489
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,759
lame Bakersfield is but it's a very

490
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,080
special special little

491
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:46,200
hole yeah yeah yeah let's talk about

492
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,519
some strains now that we're talking

493
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,759
about strain names and trying to keep

494
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,400
them uh stable let's talk about high and

495
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,079
lonesome's poodle nuts because I know

496
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,320
this is one of your your classic

497
00:20:54,079 --> 00:21:00,119
favorites yeah it's it's my all-time

498
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,119
favorite smoke um

499
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:05,158
back in like the

500
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:08,839
2010s and before maybe the eights the

501
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,679
seven six I was mainly just growing uh

502
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,199
purple Urkel and gra

503
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,038
apape um because that's what was popular

504
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,000
and I I really like the flavor of it the

505
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,519
high was not as good but like that's

506
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,359
what people wanted especially down in

507
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:24,960
the Bay area where I'm from yeah and

508
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,879
uh like I I you know it's kind of a

509
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,240
[ __ ] to grow it's really slow

510
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,278
veg um

511
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,159
I love the smell of it you know it's

512
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:39,119
nice and dense leafy but dense and um I

513
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,480
got a hold of the poodle nuts from from

514
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,839
40 ounce U we had we had traded some

515
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,400
Cuts because we were both down in the

516
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:48,839
Bay Area yeah and uh and he just

517
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,200
selected the poodle right he selected it

518
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:54,359
it was a Urkle phenotype he ended up

519
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,759
running with like for production another

520
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,439
phenotype that was more that was a

521
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:02,038
taller plant it probably was you more

522
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,440
kimd related I think it might have still

523
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:08,200
had some color but the poodle nuts was

524
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,679
an Urkle phenotype for sure squat U very

525
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,440
purple purpled up the same way same

526
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,038
branching leaves yeah the branching the

527
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,400
liness in the

528
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,798
middle um the nug structure was

529
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,759
different and it just had it had that

530
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,119
Urkle smell with the

531
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,240
fuel which back then I just said it was

532
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,918
like Urkle with some spiciness to it

533
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,200
because gas was really a term people

534
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:34,278
threw around yeah but it it was purple

535
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,278
gas it was the first encounter with

536
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:39,359
purple gas I ever had and I mean it it

537
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:42,038
took over right away like yeah as soon

538
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,199
as I started growing that over grae ape

539
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:47,200
um it vegged a little faster um it had a

540
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,798
much prettier nug the nug you know very

541
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,440
swollen kix's yes um still leafy still

542
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,000
squat but not as squat it had uni

543
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:02,080
stretch out a little bit more if you

544
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,519
tried yeah so anyway yeah i i w a i w a

545
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,599
uh a Cannabis Cup up in Humble with it

546
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:10,679
with some indoor uh poodle nuts and and

547
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,199
and like one in a landslide and you know

548
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,720
there was there was some good weed up

549
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,200
there but uh bet I mean it just had

550
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,278
everything it was just prettier than

551
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,880
anything like off right off the bat it

552
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:23,960
was just prettier than just any green

553
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,520
weed up there so I bet that helped but

554
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,960
it was super tasty and uh and uh people

555
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,038
people took notice we we smoked so much

556
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,159
weed that day you couldn't tell high at

557
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:36,400
all yeah I know what you mean but even

558
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,760
though that I think I'm pretty sure it

559
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,559
was a uh that was one of the categories

560
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,839
you just you're you're smoking you're

561
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:46,240
taking like two Puffs off of you know

562
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:48,879
for 40 joints yeah and uh you just you

563
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,919
can't tell high it's it's all flavor bag

564
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,880
appe peal smell all that stuff yeah

565
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,720
that's how it gets by the end of our our

566
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,679
uh party sessions too where every I mean

567
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,919
when there's 60 jars up there and it's

568
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,759
over over three days it's like at some

569
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,520
point you stop evaluating High because

570
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,278
you're so [ __ ] up the whole time just

571
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,759
can't yeah you just can't anym and I

572
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,480
mean if you smoke the right thing it can

573
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,440
cut through but sure it's it's really

574
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,038
hard yeah that is few and far between on

575
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,320
something that'll cut through over a

576
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:22,400
dayong sesh you know yeah sure

577
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:25,439
yeah so we have another one old Betsy uh

578
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,798
this is a a old school one out of San

579
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:33,159
Diego yeah um so bud bud up in Humble

580
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:37,038
sourced it from

581
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,840
delmare um grew it indoors and it was it

582
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:43,919
was novel you know really

583
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:46,480
smelly um unique structure sort of

584
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,480
branchy purple

585
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,480
stems

586
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,720
um then he gave it he gave it to CSI who

587
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,480
grew it Outdoors one

588
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,519
year and the next year it was half as

589
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,440
Garden

590
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,440
yeah and then so so CSI passed it out to

591
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,038
a few

592
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,679
people including me he passed it to a

593
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:14,240
few people before I had an outdoor

594
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:18,159
spot and I saw it catch on yeah um

595
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,319
quickly uh and so I I think I ran 10

596
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,919
beds of it on my first outdoor year in

597
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:26,678
uh in I think this was

598
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,880
11

599
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,440
and uh yeah 10 beds did great it was

600
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,480
half my garden the next year that's a

601
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,480
good sign dude that's a really such a

602
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,759
unique strain you could take three

603
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,159
cuting off it take the tops like October

604
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:45,960
7th and then give it two more weeks and

605
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,760
then take like the almost the rest of it

606
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,120
yeah but then wait for all all the there

607
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:52,960
wasn't really lar it was just small buds

608
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,558
they were still dense though on the

609
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,200
inside of the plant and then let those

610
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,038
go as long as you can and they would

611
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,679
purple up up and then take those and and

612
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:03,319
they'd be smaller but if you mixed it

613
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,759
into your other pounds it gave your

614
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:09,038
pounds some color yeah D and uh I mean

615
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,720
back then people didn't really grade too

616
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:14,640
much um and it kept its

617
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,600
smell you know by next April you it

618
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,640
still smelled great in the bag when you

619
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,278
were selling it and and and that's

620
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,480
that's unique a lot of especially a lot

621
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:27,398
of the hype the more hype stuff um

622
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,599
that's for sure it's just it's not bread

623
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:33,239
to do that or it's not selected to do

624
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,879
that no not at all selected to sell now

625
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,759
yeah yeah Betsy slowly making its way

626
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,440
through uh more current circles and it's

627
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:42,960
fun to watch like Growers from a

628
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,960
different generation grow her and like

629
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,399
experience her and be like oh my God

630
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,840
where what is this you know it's like

631
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:51,439
what we have it's a blast from the past

632
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,558
it's probably got a lot of skunk

633
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,159
genetics it's it's it's almost

634
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:59,839
definitely Dutch Origins right yeah I

635
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,080
would think so yeah so I mean it's it's

636
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,798
it's it's it's a it was a winner and it

637
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,960
I mean it took over people's Gardens

638
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,079
that's that's how good it was like

639
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,919
almost almost like as long as you could

640
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,558
sell it and I I sold it under Mango kush

641
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,159
yeah because because his name sucks

642
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:18,440
shitty name yeah it is it is like like

643
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,760
of course it's endearing to people who

644
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,240
know it like of course I think one of

645
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,000
the reasons it never caught on was

646
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,240
because of its name like it's its sister

647
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,278
to the cut bull rider which totally

648
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,679
caught on I mean you have Drake with

649
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,359
bull rider genetics like uh using a fake

650
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,640
bull riter to put on his clothing store

651
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:40,119
now so it still has some name value but

652
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,320
Betsy just never caught on so yeah yeah

653
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,759
weird yeah and and uh but it it it

654
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:50,038
definitely caught on in gardens up here

655
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:52,079
yeah for sure up here Trinity humble be

656
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:56,119
um and it's kind of funny if you if you

657
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,960
meet somebody who knows Betsy like it's

658
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:00,439
not that hard to trace back to who we

659
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,720
know in common oh I bet this happened to

660
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,440
me last year I'm like oh you know Betsy

661
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,640
let's figure out who our common friend

662
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,240
is because you know the circles are kind

663
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,360
of tight yeah I've tried explaining that

664
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,960
to people too like a lot of how how

665
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,158
clone circles work and how they've

666
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,919
always work and when you see people that

667
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,679
aren't necessarily connected to anyone

668
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,799
pop up with a clone it's usually either

669
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,880
ill gotten or fake just because of how

670
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:25,440
tight those circles were and how well

671
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,840
everybody knew each other and how yeah

672
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,558
how close people were to their word to

673
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,798
it so you knew that if it was making

674
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:33,839
outside the circle either someone

675
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,440
probably stole it or it probably wasn't

676
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,599
it you know if it's from a random

677
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,960
outside the circle yeah I mean and in

678
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:44,199
the circle people share pretty freely

679
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,240
sure um I've never hoarded genetics and

680
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,960
if somebody wanted it i' I'd do my best

681
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,079
to get it to them because it's a it'd be

682
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,640
a benefit you know to them yeah big time

683
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,558
I think that surprises people the most

684
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,640
is when they come from outside to inside

685
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:59,599
like one of the Clone circles that that

686
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,278
they they realize how open it is once

687
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,278
they get inside like nobody's really

688
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,000
like trading nobody's really even caring

689
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:09,319
it's like oh you want that cool here you

690
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,200
know but yeah they ass knowing somebody

691
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:13,599
yeah

692
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,798
like being trusted yeah trust trusting

693
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,480
somebody that okay I know I know you I

694
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:21,519
know you're not a cop and yeah or or or

695
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,360
or a shitthead and and

696
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:27,519
uh like I don't know like I don't really

697
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:31,158
know anybody that hoardes clones for for

698
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:33,480
the most part um the people that do I

699
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,960
know right away like they're just on

700
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,960
some other [ __ ] and they

701
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:42,960
think I don't know I don't know why they

702
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:45,158
think that their clone is so special

703
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,278
that oh I don't want this clone to get

704
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,600
blown out it's like dude like you're

705
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:53,319
growing what a couple hundred pounds of

706
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,119
it maybe like that's it's gone like yeah

707
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,480
No One's Gonna experience it nobody's

708
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,798
gonna hear of it or know it or

709
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,880
anything and there's no way the Market's

710
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,879
going to get oversaturated now

711
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,799
occasionally that can happen like look

712
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,519
with like blue dream or train wreck or

713
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,558
something but

714
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:17,399
like I mean that that's few and far

715
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:19,759
between it is you know so yeah that's a

716
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:21,678
good point dude yeah just you're you're

717
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,599
gonna be better off openly sharing

718
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,640
because then people openly share with

719
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,359
you and and you're going to have access

720
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,880
to more stuff and you'll benefit greatly

721
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,519
and at the same time you'll probably be

722
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,519
able to get those genetics back if you

723
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,038
lose them it's a good point and you know

724
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,759
the best advice I was given in cannabis

725
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,599
was uh our buddy CSI told me never tie

726
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,158
yourself to one clone never get

727
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,839
emotionally involved with one clone

728
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,720
because it leaves you stuck in in a

729
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,519
corner and once that's out you're done

730
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,000
you have no moves that's it and it it

731
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,960
was amazing advice because just from all

732
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,319
the other angles but like now you're

733
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,798
emotionally tied to one thing and you

734
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:00,158
sit there obsessing over it what's the

735
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,918
point of that you know when there's so

736
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,799
much there yeah I mean it's also like

737
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,519
things are so trendy too that if you're

738
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:10,519
not open-minded enough to what's next or

739
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,839
what's better and you don't think

740
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,599
anything's better than this stuff you

741
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:17,720
have from 2005 like yeah right you're

742
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,558
getting passed you're getting passed up

743
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,600
you know exactly and and and and and you

744
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,079
like the chances of what you having

745
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:27,839
being that great are are not very good

746
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:30,759
no no very SL To None yeah like

747
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:34,000
o few few few strains make a comeback

748
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:35,960
like sour diesel or OG kush or yeah um

749
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,599
I'm trying to bring the P Nets back I've

750
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,798
been trying for a minute oh we will get

751
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:43,839
her back yeah been I've been looking

752
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:45,359
I've gotten some mislabeled Cuts I even

753
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,439
got one I don't know if it was the real

754
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,839
one or not and I lost it due to my own

755
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,519
cloning mistakes yeah I was flowering it

756
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,558
out and I'm like oh [ __ ] this is Rainbow

757
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,159
belts

758
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:57,798
[ __ ] so like I made that one and then I

759
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,679
got it back and I'm like oh this isn't

760
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:03,038
even poodle nuts this is London pound

761
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,679
cake well you know close I even bred

762
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,440
with it and I'm like [ __ ] now I got this

763
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,000
whole breeding project going on and I've

764
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,840
got all this London pound cake S1 and

765
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,398
crossed Kim D and how did London

766
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,798
poundcake Express for you what does she

767
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:20,439
smell like do you know it a

768
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:23,319
75 it's funny it's kind of fragrant and

769
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,080
veg and it's kind of squat so I didn't

770
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:28,158
notice right away and

771
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,918
then and then it kind of just started

772
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,240
smelling more like gelato to me and it

773
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,120
didn't have that urk and fuel yeah it

774
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,120
threw me it took a while for me to kind

775
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:39,959
of

776
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:43,000
like realize that it wasn't the real one

777
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,360
and by then everything's pollinated and

778
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
yeah of course it's good weed it's like

779
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:51,558
it's it's not bad at all yeah in fact I

780
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,638
wish I hadn't lost it but I basically

781
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:56,079
just gave it up because I was pissed and

782
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,918
didn't keep a mother yeah you know but

783
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,759
now I was real real I'm like oh man

784
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,519
that's it's pretty good weed yeah that's

785
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:04,480
funny dude yeah that's the other thing

786
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,720
about poodle nuts that I'll never forget

787
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,519
and URL has a similar trait where in veg

788
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,839
when you take cuts it smells very skunky

789
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,679
in the room yeah poodle nuts was like

790
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:14,519
seriously I could be in my living room

791
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,320
taking cuts my chick in the bedroom be

792
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,399
like get a stunk walk in people say talk

793
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:22,240
about weed being skunky in veg that

794
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,398
plant I don't think there's anything

795
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,038
more skunky than bu nuts to me in Veg

796
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,839
it's crazy I I I agree another plant

797
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:33,398
that used to really smell besides like

798
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:36,798
Urkel was the genius cut oh I never got

799
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:39,959
to grower yeah it was it was kind of a

800
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:44,480
weak finicky plant and and and and

801
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:47,159
lateral branching and cool unique uh nug

802
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,200
structure and and good skunky smell to

803
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:53,559
it um great

804
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,120
High um but it was also very skunky in

805
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,720
veg

806
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,158
interesting yeah yeah CSI has mentioned

807
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,159
that one a few times to me over the

808
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,559
years and I've never I've never I wish I

809
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,639
had made some seed with it honestly I I

810
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:07,918
don't have any more Apollo 11 seeds I

811
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,239
grew Apollo 11 a few year a few times

812
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,079
and it was good weed yeah I wish I wish

813
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,918
I had more of that um that's part of my

814
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,760
seed stash that got lost I grew a lot of

815
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,719
13 I never never grew much 11 but 13 I

816
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,760
grew a ton of it probably wasn't too

817
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,559
different yeah I don't I don't think so

818
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,200
this one was all a lot of grapy

819
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:32,199
Expressions on big huge Jack ha type

820
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:33,878
buds oh yeah oh yeah no it wasn't grapey

821
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:38,838
at all for me though the Apollo 11 was

822
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:39,960
just skunk was it yeah that [ __ ] out

823
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:42,599
very weak

824
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,320
stems not a great commercial plant but a

825
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,359
pretty plant yeah kind of like not a

826
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,879
huge stretcher but still had like very

827
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:52,000
narrow

828
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:54,480
leaves yeah that makes sense plant cool

829
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,039
Plant so poodle nuts

830
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,320
uh yeah I I have some I had some old old

831
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,159
s1's from a from a from a from a run

832
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,559
from

833
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,639
2010 that I've kept in a bag in the

834
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:08,119
fridge and I got three to pop this year

835
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:11,279
so I have I have three s1's growing

836
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:15,119
Outdoors right now they all look very

837
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,119
similar the the tallest one of the bunch

838
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,838
is is very close to the original smell I

839
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,920
think yeah but like the leaves are all

840
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:24,799
green which is unusual where the other

841
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,000
two the leaves are starting to purple

842
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,720
because it's you know it's fall it's

843
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,079
almost October

844
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:32,279
and uh the temps are the temps are

845
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,839
cooling off one of them doesn't really

846
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,760
smell at all or or or or nothing close

847
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:39,400
to what what I'm looking for and then

848
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,560
one of them is like very Urkel kind of

849
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,838
down there but it doesn't have the

850
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:46,400
spiciness to it or the gas to it yeah so

851
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:48,719
I mean that's that's what I got out of

852
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,880
those I have clones of all of them uh

853
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:54,239
I'm gonna I'm definitely keeping them I

854
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,039
I my plan next year is to run I have a

855
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,639
bunch of hybrids of it um the the reason

856
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,400
I wanted it back was to make a sour

857
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,078
diesel hybrid with it yeah because I had

858
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,160
done that accidentally back in the day

859
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,000
and the one seed I got out of a sour

860
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:11,639
diesel was just a diesel tall diesel

861
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,719
structured plant with purple flowers and

862
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:17,199
that poodle nut smell that's wow and and

863
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,759
a great potent High I'm I'm thinking the

864
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:23,239
sour diesel helped the high a bit Yeah

865
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,520
and uh I I want that plant back and I we

866
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:28,719
only grew out one but you know my buddy

867
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,960
agreed that it was a good plant

868
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:34,078
yeah so I want to make that cross again

869
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,960
it just crosses good to to uh to kushes

870
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:41,880
to OG I grew some uh triangle to poodle

871
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,800
nuts from zo zoi last year very

872
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,400
impressed very impressed with how well

873
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,519
the smell carried over yeah the color

874
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,358
didn't carry over the structure didn't

875
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:53,519
really carry over but the smell those

876
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:55,880
turps were there in that in that bud

877
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,039
which was really cool yeah me and me and

878
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,760
H lonon crossed it to the the blue

879
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,719
bondet stuff we use which is like a

880
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,160
really short squat blueberry but in the

881
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:08,039
end it made for this beautiful blueberry

882
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:10,279
version of of the puut just stuck to

883
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,279
that structure and just super blueberry

884
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,480
Berry turps on top of all that skunky

885
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,680
right it was beautiful oh nice nice well

886
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,199
I have some of those seeds they're going

887
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,639
to get popped next year that's right

888
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,159
yeah and uh I gave you the last of

889
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:25,598
highend lonesome's I think what it was

890
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:27,279
is poodle nuts cross poodle

891
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,559
nuts

892
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,519
poodle nuts cross dog Walts I think

893
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,318
that's what it

894
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:36,079
was was

895
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:38,358
it it was poodle nuts to like a a

896
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,280

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,280
they'll pop they're old May been I never

900

903

always use poodle nuts in it oh okay but

912
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:21,679

be a a open pollination maybe I don't

914

totally all right so you you've done a

927

lot lot um of grows of modern stuff too

928
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,920
obviously you're good friends with CSI

929
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,719
can you talk some about your experiences

930
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,079
with the Skittles and sherb stuff so I

931
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,399
know that's going to interest a lot of

932
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:13,039
people okay um yeah I I I'm growing out

933
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:16,880
now his uh Skittles to sherbet

934
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:19,838
cross um I think I've got 20s something

935
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,160
females going I had one plant completely

936
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:24,199
Herm out but I killed it before before

937
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,920
it

938
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:31,159
uh uh blew pollen yeah and

939
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,960
uh it was it was very hermy very

940
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,639
surprising but boy hermy up the Wazoo on

941
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,920
that one uh it was almost more male

942
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:42,199
flowers than female wow um I'm glad I

943
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,119
caught it

944
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:48,879
anyways um yeah so there's 20s something

945
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,400
of them I would all but two smell like

946
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,519
sherbet um or maybe all but three smell

947
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,240
like sherbet and then two of them are I

948
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:02,280
would say the bud structure of looks

949
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:06,118
very Skittles yeah um but the smell is

950
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,040
sherbet um various Heights uh one of the

951
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,960
shorter ones is definitely a skittles

952
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:13,119
phenotype and then one of the like the

953
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,358
medium height ones is a is a skittles

954
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,318
phenotype smell wise anyways um and then

955
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:22,239
one of them is probably the most pungent

956
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:25,480
of the bunch and it's like a sherbet

957
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:28,159
strawberry smell and so I of course I

958
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,318
didn't have cuts of that one so I went I

959
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,078
went back I think it was last week and

960
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,759
and and we took uh we took cuts off the

961
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:38,318
bottom and uh those those cuts off the

962
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,599
bottom they have little flowers on them

963
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:45,239
but they will revert fairly quickly when

964
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,119
after you Roo them yeah I've I've I've

965
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:50,159
done that a bunch off SE I do a lot of

966
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,318
that I I actually sometimes prefer it

967
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,799
yeah because then that I mean that

968
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:56,440
allows you to wait for one and then like

969
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,280
and not end up with this big vegging

970
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,559
plant but also like um you can if if if

971
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,880
you don't want to take cuts off

972
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,078
everything you can just wait for the

973
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,119
smells you want to yeah I took cuts of

974
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:12,200
everything and and and pretty quick here

975
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,119
some of them are going to get uh cold

976
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,358
but um yeah did you get a lot of did you

977
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,400
see any Skittles type stuff as far as

978
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:23,799
TPS go yeah off two of them have a have

979
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,760
a have Skittles smell okay so that's

980
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,119
good I mean for two out of out of

981
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,319
what 18 20 something yeah yeah so so

982
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,480
just so people know that's kind of a

983
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:37,239
range to expect even even in like

984
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,960
Skittles s1's how dominant the actual

985
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:42,759
really really uh desirable turp is in a

986
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,039
lot of those things yeah I've noticed a

987
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,680
lot of Skittle crosses give off like a

988
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:51,079
strawberry scent yeah which isn't bad no

989
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,159
but it's not Skittles and to me Skittles

990
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:57,119
is is just one of the best smells in

991
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:59,279
cannabis period yeah

992
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,318
it's like an extreme grapefruit to me

993
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,839
like if you grapefruit RH is what I get

994
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,838
from it but also if you think like green

995
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:10,078
Skittles sometimes that it's that too

996
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,400
yeah it could be that definitely I

997
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,240
definitely like if I think of the old

998
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,400
sweet pink grapefruit clone though it's

999
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:19,199
like that the extracts of that is what

1000
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,760
the Skittles I wish I had that cut yeah

1001
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:25,519
right like I grew it once a long time

1002
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,160
ago yeah um again a cool Plant uh

1003
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:32,318
probably Northern

1004
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:34,759
lights um really great smell to it funky

1005
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,800
structure um I wish I still had that

1006
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,440
that just was that it had that real just

1007
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,680
like skunky Funk that that weed used to

1008
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,079
have and and you don't see that at all

1009
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:48,078
really anymore it's no you don't you

1010
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:51,480
know so I think that's that's part of

1011
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,039
why especially with prices being so low

1012
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,480
um I feel like there is room to

1013
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,039
experiment a little bit or or or or also

1014
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,358
it's more important to experiment and

1015
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:03,519
and and do some pheno hunts even though

1016
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:05,199
space is at a premium just

1017
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,679
because

1018
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:10,519
like you can't get stuck growing all

1019
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,719
this same garbage that no people think

1020
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:14,079
they

1021
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,118
want if you don't show them something

1022
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,880
else they're not gonna know they like it

1023
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:22,240
more exactly you know and and and so

1024
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,880
it's that chicken or the egg thing like

1025
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,598
why is everybody buying all this [ __ ]

1026
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,079
purple gas garbage that that that that

1027
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,519
the high is not that great and the

1028
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,480
flavor is just meh and and it's like

1029
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,838
well that's all we're growing right so

1030
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,960
yeah what we're letting them demand the

1031
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,000
market show them show them what good

1032
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,880
weed is and and and hopefully you can

1033
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,400
find some that'll still test high enough

1034
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,400
to actually get bought in the first

1035
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,000
place yeah that's that's kind of like

1036
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,639
another barrier is a lot of this old

1037
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,400
stuff won't test high but then again a

1038
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:55,759
lot of this old stuff hasn't been tested

1039
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,880
with 2023 parameters which everything's

1040
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,680
over 20% now you know bro my all my

1041
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,800
blueberry stuff like all that blueberry

1042
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:05,598
work I've done is all testing like 26 28

1043
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,079
have you ever heard of blueberry test at

1044
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,480
26 or 28 bro in your life no the yeah

1045
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,559
blueberry is not super

1046
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,318
potent all my all my blueberry hybrids

1047
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:21,319
even pure blueberry is testing like 28

1048
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:23,400
25 which maybe maybe the blue bonnet

1049
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:25,000
maybe Lone Star worked it special which

1050
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,280
I think you did but like if that even

1051
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,920
still like being able to take blueberry

1052
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,359
that high even in in one move in an

1053
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,318
outcross still is not really feasible so

1054
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:35,598
I think that a lot of these old lines if

1055
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,358
they were tested under today's

1056
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,680
parameters might actually like really

1057
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:39,719
shock the [ __ ] out of people when it

1058
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:42,000
tests

1059
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,279
that right not because they're more

1060
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,039
potent now but because everything tests

1061
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,040
higher now and Labs have to put out good

1062
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,920
results or they don't get business and

1063
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:51,599
exactly they don't get repeat business

1064
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,400
from

1065
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,160
people so dumbb to be buying based off

1066
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,519
THC percentage I know people think

1067
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:00,118
they're getting a better value but the

1068
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:03,280
reality is they're just getting shitty

1069
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,640
weed yeah I mean that's that is what it

1070
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,760
is and and you know it goes back to the

1071
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:11,519
education part how do you get how do you

1072
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,520
get the end user who are not Growers to

1073
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,280
want to be interested enough to learn

1074
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,000
about like maybe sativa indicia and

1075
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,119
hybrid are not the best descriptions of

1076
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,599
a high you know how do you like how do

1077
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:25,599
you explain that like THC percentages

1078
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:28,280
are is like a s 1970s 1980s thing that

1079
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,838
we moved on from there like yeah I don't

1080
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,920
know how I don't know I think I I think

1081
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:36,920
you just do the old free sample like try

1082
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,440
try this first yeah bro you're right

1083
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,159
you're right

1084
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,079
that's it sounds it sounds so obvious

1085
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:47,039
but yeah and when you can do things like

1086
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:49,400
tastings or have events where you can

1087
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,838
like pass a joint to

1088
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,559
somebody like that that's how you get

1089
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:56,119
that's how you spread it that's how you

1090
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,319
like help especially the Young

1091
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:01,400
generation realize that you know what

1092
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:03,599
they think is that great is not that

1093
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,400
great you know and and there's there's

1094
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:10,519
so much else out there there's there's

1095
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:13,240
such better highs out there and and yeah

1096
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:18,000
I mean so people maybe don't realize

1097
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:20,519
like in 200 say five to 2010 the only

1098
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,480
things testing over 20% were like OG and

1099
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:27,920
Kim dog y but like old SOG super silver

1100
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,039
Hayes will get you absolutely ripped and

1101
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,480
it will cut through any other thing

1102
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:34,558
anything else you're smoking you'll get

1103
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,760
high all over again and that's like 19

1104
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,920
100% And so I mean even things like

1105
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,319
poodle nuts which aren't never tested

1106
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:44,240
super high would test like 18 19 I think

1107
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:47,480
I had it as high as

1108
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:50,318
23 um W which for that for that time

1109
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,480
period was really good that's huge yeah

1110
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,679
um I mean I don't know what it would be

1111
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,240
now it would probably be you could

1112
00:46:53,679 --> 00:47:00,558
probably hit over 30 with it

1113
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:02,239
yeah so I bet you could yeah just buying

1114
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,960
off of like the numbers are [ __ ]

1115
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,799
anyways so what are you really buying

1116
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,280
like people used to buy weed based off

1117
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,359
smell because that was the best

1118
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,119
determining factor of of the quality of

1119
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:15,039
the weed yeah you know the flavor it's

1120
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,480
what gets the mouth watering you know

1121
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:20,279
it's you know so I just had a collective

1122
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,480
write me on IG the other day and asked

1123
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,200
me so we have one of your strings here

1124
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,519
but we we're about to put it on the menu

1125
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:28,759
um what do I put it under index sa

1126
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,358
hybrid and I had I actually sat there

1127
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,760
all stoned and I was like let me have

1128
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:37,358
this discussion with you kid you know

1129
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:39,800
like Inda HD so like the retail when

1130
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,119
when when clubs dispensaries started

1131
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,839
opening they latched on because that was

1132
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,960
the General consensus is that these

1133
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:50,880
narrow leaves are sativa and it's like a

1134
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,639
up euphoric busy Speedy High and the

1135
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,800
indas were these broad Leafs and their

1136
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:58,400
couch lock and then there's hybrids and

1137
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,720
they just latched on to that because

1138
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,800
they wanted to sell the consumer a

1139
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,519
feeling yeah right so needed to tell

1140
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,160
them something so like what do you want

1141
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,079
to do you want like a daytime thing or

1142
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:10,598
you're trying to chill out at night and

1143
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,960
they wanted to sell they just want to

1144
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:15,720
sell them yeah you know something and

1145
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,400
they just lashed on to it like it's a

1146
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:21,159
fact and it's not a fact at all and and

1147
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,358
it's not even the the taxonomy of the

1148
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:24,838
plant has nothing to do with the

1149
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:26,480
chemicals in it no not even and even

1150
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:28,880
then I don't even think can tell

1151
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,719
chemically the difference between sativa

1152
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,480
and Inda I doubt it right you can't tell

1153
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:36,480
by tpin I mean they could both have

1154
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,440
trinoline yeah I was gonna say even like

1155
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,920
even like CHR has trinoline so that kind

1156
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:44,400
of erases that one right right so I mean

1157
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,960
you know if you show these people a real

1158
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,039
sativa or a real narrowleaf drug

1159
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,679
cultivar they would probably thumb their

1160
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,798
noses at it oh for sure that that's you

1161
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,480
know that's another discussion about

1162
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:58,559
like the newer kids on IG that are like

1163
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,639
buying land races and stuff that you

1164
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,280
know like they're like I'm going to buy

1165
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:03,199
some Indian Land races and blah blah

1166
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,400
blah and they have no clue that they

1167
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,759
don't even want to grow like this jungly

1168
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,599
thing that you have to flower as a

1169
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,200
Seedling this big you know or it's going

1170
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:15,400
to be 20 feet tall like there's a lot of

1171
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,480
um I don't know what you'd even call

1172
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,160
that right they they don't have the

1173
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,440
patience for it they're they're not

1174
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:23,358
going to get anything that they're going

1175
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,358
to be able to sell to anybody they're

1176
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:30,119
going to get made fun of

1177
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:32,719
like sply hairy weed and then they're

1178
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:36,200
going to just decide that that's no good

1179
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:38,159
and and go you know go get purple purple

1180
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:39,679
gas you know yeah exactly I mean it's

1181
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:40,838
like there's no floral structure really

1182
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,960
there and I don't think that they

1183
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:43,199
understand that there's Bud that even

1184
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,798
looks like that without floral

1185
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,039
structures you know yeah yeah yeah it's

1186
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:49,400
yeah it's definitely a different thing

1187
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,798
and um watching the new generation move

1188
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,519
in and try to navigate the weird world

1189
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:55,920
of cannabis from the start it's been

1190
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,719
really really funny to watch because I I

1191
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,400
did it myself I know exactly what

1192
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,358
they're going through I I made every

1193
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,160
idiot move you could make you know

1194
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:05,679
they're they're growing up thinking Sour

1195
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:09,519
Diesel and blue dream or sativas yeah oh

1196
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:10,118
yeah for sure you for sure I mean sativa

1197
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,519
I

1198
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:17,039
mean blue dream just based on its

1199
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:20,719
genetics is 5050 at best yes yeah

1200
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:24,440
probably 75% yeah broadly Afghan

1201
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:27,000
yeah yeah so yeah for folks out there

1202
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,760
call call what you think is an Inda a

1203
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,639
broad leaf cultivar and call what you

1204
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:34,359
think is sativa a narrow Leaf drug

1205
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:36,400
cultivar and and leave the sativa in the

1206
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:39,358
uh in the indicia stuff

1207
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,318
for you know the Chads trying to sell a

1208
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:45,279
feeling I mean you got pins made of

1209
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:47,440
disate with with a sativa or a oh Inda

1210
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,119
label on them so trying to explain that

1211
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,960
to people too like why there's no point

1212
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,760
in even picking up a distillate pen that

1213
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,199
says hybrid indic like there's no

1214
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,559
difference in any that it's all it's all

1215
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,078
hybrids anyways yeah and and honestly

1216
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:05,319
people react different to different

1217
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:08,039
tpping so for some people most PE most

1218
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:11,599
people something broadleaf is really

1219
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:14,199
gonna like be a couch lock yeah or have

1220
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,400
this more sedata of high but other

1221
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:18,439
people it's going to make them get up

1222
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,039
and clean their house yes you know and

1223
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,119
it just it just reacts with people

1224
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:23,838
differently and that's your body

1225
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:25,798
chemistry and and what's going on with

1226
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:28,039
you at that moment is is going to react

1227
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:29,519
differently and set and setting you find

1228
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:30,639
the same weed all the time once you find

1229
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,079
something you like you're probably never

1230
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,960
going to see it again it kind of sucks

1231
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:36,680
you know like I I learned this later on

1232
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,400
in life from because I was never a big

1233
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:40,639
psychedelic kid I never really got into

1234
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,160
that stuff but learning about set and

1235
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,759
setting and psychedelics and and I never

1236
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:47,000
understood how people haven't applied

1237
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,960
that to cannabis because it's just there

1238
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,318
was set and setting with Heroin they're

1239
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,838
set and setting with all kinds of drugs

1240
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:55,880
um there they did some studies where uh

1241
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:58,199
people would overdose on the same amount

1242
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,960
of heroin if they were using it in a

1243
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:02,118
place they weren't familiar with so like

1244
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,639
versus their own home where they're

1245
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:07,039
comfortable so setting is a major part

1246
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,118
of everything whether it's cannabis or

1247
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,199
anything you're consuming you know so um

1248
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,119
I think that's one of those things

1249
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:15,838
that's left out quite a bit Yeah so like

1250
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,200
yeah absolutely like people get paranoia

1251
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,558
and anxiety sometimes and yeah that's

1252
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:22,358
because of where you're at in your head

1253
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:23,680
space or maybe where where you are like

1254
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:24,920
maybe you're not comfortable around

1255
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,598
these people or maybe you have something

1256
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:30,039
on your mind that's uh that's wearing on

1257
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,920
it maybe it's not a good time to to to

1258
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:35,480
to get loaded but yeah

1259
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,599
um yeah people Overlook that and also

1260
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,599
like with with with increased potency

1261
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,760
with with the way things are it's like

1262
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,640
don't smoke the whole joint just yeah

1263
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,640
you know take a puff see how you feel

1264
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:48,798
and then go back to it you know I had to

1265
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,838
learn that myself you know like going as

1266
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:53,079
a kid I would just puff tough like hard

1267
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:55,400
all the time and then as an adult my

1268
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,760
hormones change dude like I there's

1269
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,039
times when my chick boox by she's like

1270
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,160
dude just take a hit don't like it's the

1271
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,880
morning it's your first hit just take a

1272
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:04,920
hit you do not need to smoke The Whole

1273
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,358
Bowl like yeah it's it's certainly

1274
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:10,119
something I learned

1275
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:13,639
um that I couldn't I was kind of more of

1276
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:14,680
a nighttime smoker um anyways when I was

1277
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:17,159
a heavy

1278
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:18,719
smoker uh unless there was like some

1279
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:21,318
social function where we were smoking

1280
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,798
during the day but I I I kind of learned

1281
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:24,558
especially as I started growing more and

1282
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:26,559
more weed and kind of putting my ass out

1283
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,319
there a little bit more before

1284
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,240
legalization

1285
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:32,960
um that it it's instead of like

1286
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:35,879
relieving all anxiety it started to

1287
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,199
amplifying it yeah and then

1288
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,519
so I barely even smoked for a few years

1289
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,000
because I just wasn't enjoying it yeah

1290
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,039
and then when I would smoke I had no

1291
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,079
tolerance and I'd get ripped and

1292
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:50,159
paranoid and feel uncomfortable for 15

1293
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:52,160
minutes so it wasn't fun but then as

1294
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:55,480
time went on I kind of

1295
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:57,598
learned um set and setting or I just

1296
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,760
call it time and place yeah like there's

1297
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,000
certain activities that I know will be

1298
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,000
enhanced and better if I smoke out first

1299
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,639
yeah like before I go on a mountain bike

1300
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,318
ride or before I clean my house or

1301
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,159
before um I got a bunch of like

1302
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:15,039
monotonous work to do in the greenhouse

1303
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:16,480
where it's hot that's a great time

1304
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,759
because you just put on some music and

1305
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,880
you zone out and you don't really have

1306
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,240
to think and you just get to work and

1307
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,880
it's the same thing like when you're

1308
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,959
like I used to trail run it was great

1309
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,760
for that because you don't in your head

1310
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,639
just thinking about other stuff besides

1311
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,240
how tired you are how far away from the

1312
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:33,719
car you are or whatever else is going on

1313
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,519
and all of a sudden like you realize oh

1314
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:37,759
my lungs aren't burning like this is

1315
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:41,000
great like I could I could do another

1316
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:45,160
mile yeah and so it's for for me that's

1317
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,639
that's where it really works um and and

1318
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:50,399
I love it like that's and I smoke more

1319
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:52,759
now because I know when are the right

1320
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,200
times that's important I think that's

1321
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,359
super important and that's that's

1322
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:59,480
something I had to learn myself like I

1323
00:54:56,358 --> 00:55:02,679
know if I'm having a super bad like

1324
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,079
stressful day that it's probably like a

1325
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:06,358
lot of people use it to relieve stress

1326
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,760
when they're having a bad day I cannot

1327
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:11,440
like it will spin me out and put me in a

1328
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:14,240
bad black hole no matter what no matter

1329
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,920
if I'm like I dab all day like I just

1330
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:17,479
even as we're sitting here I'm dabbing

1331
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,559
and it doesn't really affect me or make

1332
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,760
me too paranoid but there's certain

1333
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:22,680
times where if I'm in a real bad mood

1334
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,160
and I

1335
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:29,358
dab to the Moon just like not anywhere

1336
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:33,118
good you know I need back rubs

1337
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:35,358
please yeah and in that sense it is a

1338
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,559
medicine and we're kind of using it

1339
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:42,719
medically to improve things but also

1340
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:45,798
like knowing when not to not to use

1341
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:47,639
that's what I figured out and if I'm

1342
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:50,000
super annoyed over something it's

1343
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:51,960
actually good to smoke out because then

1344
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,838
I just kind of stopped dwelling on it

1345
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:58,480
now yeah and and uh you know I just kind

1346
00:55:55,838 --> 00:56:00,719
of move on you know my personality is so

1347
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,760
opposite bro like that that makes me

1348
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:05,558
Hyper obsessed when I'm like that oh

1349
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,960
it's a worst yeah so people just got to

1350
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:09,319
figure it out for themselves and it's

1351
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,159
not for everybody either but for most

1352
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:14,519
people that figure it out it enhances

1353
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:16,719
their life greatly yeah it is it is very

1354
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,480
specific especially for me this whole

1355
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:19,798
journey like I've had a LoveHate

1356
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,760
relationship at some points with

1357
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:24,199
cannabis because it's put me in such bad

1358
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,839
mental zones but once you figure that

1359
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:28,960
out the set part the time and place it's

1360
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:31,199
it's it does change a lot and and you

1361
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,559
realize it's not one it's not a cure all

1362
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,679
and it shouldn't be a cure all it

1363
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,119
shouldn't fix all of your moods and it's

1364
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:40,239
not weird if it doesn't you know yeah

1365
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,160
totally totally all right so you've been

1366
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,399
growing a lot of or is there a specific

1367
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:48,159
TKS one that you like a lot or have you

1368
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,960
been growing a bunch um I just have one

1369
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:53,558
I got from Roots Nursery

1370
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,838
um it's funny when you talk to people on

1371
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:57,760
the legal side and

1372
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:00,759
if you can establish that they're from

1373
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,520
the old days like they're so much cooler

1374
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,000
and there's more passion and they

1375
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:07,838
actually know what they're talking about

1376
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,838
so that these guys were absolutely that

1377
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,558
um and so we just talked about tons of

1378
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,279
[ __ ] and he grew out I think he only

1379
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:18,839
grew out a pack of s1s but he selected a

1380
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:21,960
good TKS S1 and and it's very much OG

1381
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:23,960
and to I I don't know how TK it is on

1382
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,440
that Spectrum where like TK is on the

1383
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:31,880
earthy side yep and like sfes on the on

1384
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,920
the pinea side but um it's a little

1385
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,920
early for to to really tell but it's

1386
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,240
I've seen it indoor um I've seen it

1387
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,960
grown out indoors and it's just OG

1388
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:42,399
that's awesome and so yeah I'm I'm

1389
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,679
stoked to be growing that I'm gonna grow

1390
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,838
it again next year for sure that's

1391
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:49,879
that's my favorite side of TK

1392
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:52,599
personally yeah yeah I I was always fond

1393
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:55,760
of sfv like any to me but to me like any

1394
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:57,798
well-grown t or any well grown OG is

1395
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,640
super dank yeah I don't care which one

1396
00:57:57,798 --> 00:58:04,318
it is I'm going to enjoy it like 100%

1397
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:06,838
right yep if it's grown well

1398
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,838
and yeah that's you know that's that's

1399
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:11,239
all I really care about and does it

1400
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:14,440
check the box and is it grown well if

1401
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:15,798
it's grown well it's super dank and

1402
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,838
people that have never smoked it are

1403
00:58:15,798 --> 00:58:20,358
just going to be blown away Y and and

1404
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:22,599
I'm growing it I'm growing it again

1405
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:24,838
because I stopped growing it just like

1406
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,039
everybody else for a long time and then

1407
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:28,239
realize it

1408
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:29,799
like you know I'm guilty of following

1409
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:31,679
the hype too but just because I'm a

1410
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:34,119
commercial cultivator I got to grow what

1411
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:37,480
people want even if it's not as good as

1412
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:39,519
what else I could grow sure and so I got

1413
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,880
away from growing ogs a lot of people

1414
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:42,239
are growing them again now because

1415
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,720
they're realizing like you know what

1416
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,798
this this [ __ ] carbon fiber or

1417
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:51,480
whatever is not that [ __ ] great yeah

1418
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:53,318
you know and and and so like you know

1419
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,798
the the price is the same either way

1420
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:57,880
like I'm I'm growing [ __ ] OG I want

1421
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:59,838
to grow some good smoke I want to grow

1422
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,400
something that like maybe you know

1423
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:06,519
somebody Associates with my name at some

1424
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,480
point and and and and just realizes that

1425
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:12,079
like holy [ __ ] like o OG is still king

1426
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,480
for a reason you know or one of the

1427
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:17,359
Kings for this season I've been getting

1428
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,960
asked more from act honestly not even

1429
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:22,440
from seed buyers from breeders and other

1430
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,720
Growers hey did you keep any OG Cuts bro

1431
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,920
cuz nobody kept them nobody [ __ ] kept

1432
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,000
nobody kept him I couldn't [ __ ]

1433
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,960
believe OG is rare

1434
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,719
now

1435
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,280
it's Cuts right right and and and and

1436
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:38,558
and it's and it's tough to Source stuff

1437
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,280
that nobody has anymore not not just

1438
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,599
because like like it's hard to find the

1439
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,119
person with it but like somebody's gonna

1440
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:48,960
[ __ ] you at some point and just give

1441
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:52,519
you a cut so I I think I sourced the sfv

1442
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,838
from these same guys they were skeptical

1443
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:57,679
as well so they

1444
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,558
they they they first they tested it for

1445
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:02,159
for hopl and vroid and and that's good

1446
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:06,160
and then now they're they're flowering

1447
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:09,118
it out next to the TKS one to see is

1448
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:11,399
this really sfv what's going on with it

1449
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,160
so they're they're skeptical as well

1450
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,318
they're note it until they know what it

1451
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:18,118
is where do you source sfb to this is a

1452
01:00:15,318 --> 01:00:20,159
good conversation like oh I didn't see I

1453
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,358
didn't even ask them where they got it I

1454
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,920
felt like that wasn't any of my business

1455
01:00:22,358 --> 01:00:25,119
and I would just let them kind of do

1456
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,559
their thing but

1457
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,440
but with sfv where would you Source it

1458
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:32,559
to what do you mean who's the original

1459
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,440
sourcer sfv who brought that online who

1460
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,599
brought that

1461
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:40,760
exact that's not I mean at this point it

1462
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:43,838
was spread around so much that like you

1463
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,559
could have legitimate sfv and not know

1464
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:47,078
like really where it came from at one

1465
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,160
point because that's that's a problem

1466
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:50,798
everybody had it at one point how do we

1467
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:52,558
now now that it's disappeared like

1468
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:54,519
pretty well disappeared as far as like

1469
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,200
this cut sfb there's one person who

1470
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:58,400
brought it to the table and held it

1471
01:00:56,199 --> 01:01:00,759
there's never been that so now that it's

1472
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,079
kind of like me and CSN were talking

1473
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,920
about this specifically so I wanted to

1474
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,798
get your opinion like how do you how do

1475
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,159
you even go about sourcing an sfv who

1476
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:09,719
would you go back to because I wouldn't

1477
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:12,358
go to Josh D for sfb because his cup was

1478
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:15,399
never called sfb someone else labeled

1479
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:17,078
that I don't know I don't know it would

1480
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,280
have to be somebody from Southern

1481
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:21,079
California yeah I don't know who put

1482
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,000
that moniker on it and I don't know that

1483
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:27,599
there even was one sfv I don't either

1484
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,920
could have multiple correct and you know

1485
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,599
people people would really get nitpicky

1486
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,000
with what's oh that's a good one or

1487
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,318
that's not a good one and I'm like yeah

1488
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,039
dude like if you grow it well like it's

1489
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:42,679
a good one and if you don't grow it well

1490
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:44,799
like okay okay oh I don't like sfv the

1491
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:46,519
sfv I saw was garbage and now sfv is

1492
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,318
garbage not really you just saw some

1493
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:52,880
Bakers field OG is probably because

1494
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:55,838
bakersfi OG bro yeah you know

1495
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:59,240
yeah seed line didn't help you know he

1496
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:01,960
released a OG and on out and then

1497
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:04,959
darkart Nursery started selling

1498
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,639
sfv and I I asked them myself they don't

1499
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,119
[ __ ] know they're just employees that

1500
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,480
don't [ __ ] care but they they would

1501
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:13,680
use the description of

1502
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,400
swerves to on their SF and I was like

1503
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,519
y'all don't did y'all grow this from

1504
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,079
seed or did you Source a cut like just

1505
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,000
[ __ ] tell me like they wouldn't even

1506
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,640
know nobody [ __ ] knows anything they

1507
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,960
don't nobody there knows anything you

1508
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,798
know they're really they're just

1509
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,519
employees yeah they don't want to get

1510
01:02:27,798 --> 01:02:31,440
[ __ ] peppered with questions from a

1511
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:34,119
grower who's [ __ ] anal about that

1512
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,720
[ __ ] no no and that's that's the hard

1513
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:37,519
part with a lot about with a lot of

1514
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:39,399
these nurseries is that you'll find out

1515
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,559
like you go to them and these are people

1516
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,000
who are supposed to be holding the

1517
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,400
clones and like libraries for people

1518
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,599
they don't give a [ __ ] about genetics at

1519
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,920
all so like when you're were talking

1520
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:48,920
about this Nursery you're working with

1521
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,760
that they were cool what were they

1522
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:54,760
called uh Roots Nursery Roots Nursery

1523
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:58,720
like that's a rarity to find like legit

1524
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:00,640
rning super Rarity um and and I'm

1525
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:02,719
shouting them out to to maybe throw him

1526
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:05,000
some business honestly because I don't

1527
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,439
want these guys to disappear they're

1528
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,719
they're doing good stuff and they have

1529
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,240
good cuts and they're doing they're

1530
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:11,439
doing feno selections they're doing

1531
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:15,838
breeding but they're also holding some

1532
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,039
of that older stuff yeah so so uh and

1533
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,038
and they know what they're talking about

1534
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,000
they're they've been around you can just

1535
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,799
half hour on the phone with them you

1536
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,838
know yeah you know yeah instantly

1537
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:27,920
totally so all right let's move on to

1538
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:31,599
the Phoenix let's talk about this bad

1539
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:36,000
girl yeah Phoenix uh I got a bunch of

1540
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:39,278
seedlings from CSI in 2019 to flower out

1541
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,519
uh I got I think he gave me 120 but I

1542
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:43,599
think we ended up flowering out 111 okay

1543
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:46,038
and

1544
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,440
uh for whatever reason maybe some didn't

1545
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:49,799
make it or maybe they were just runty

1546
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,880
and I didn't want to bother because run

1547
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:55,719
runs weren't going to runs weren't going

1548
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:58,798
to make the cut anyways yeah not not no

1549
01:03:55,719 --> 01:04:00,919
yeah not for what I was selecting for um

1550
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,838
you know there there were some shorter

1551
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,400
plants that had great noses on them from

1552
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:09,199
the from the

1553
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:11,639
T1000 um that's what Phoenix is is T1000

1554
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:14,639
to TK so it's a TK

1555
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:16,118
batross and uh I mean it's really cool

1556
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:17,879
looking through that many plants I've

1557
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:20,000
never looked through a hundred a 100

1558
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,680
plants before from the same from the

1559
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,278
same line just to see the spread and

1560
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:27,519
then and like you could put them most of

1561
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:30,599
the plants would either be like green OG

1562
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:31,920
types or like would have purple leaves

1563
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:35,079
but still green

1564
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,798
bud and be and have more of that musky

1565
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:39,039
or cookies scent but they would look

1566
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:39,960
like cookies crosses as opposed to just

1567
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,960
pure

1568
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,960
cookies um and so the Phoenix is from

1569
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,400
that group and then the outliers were

1570
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,599
like one plant that looked absolutely

1571
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,119
like cookies like beautiful if you

1572
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:55,079
scroll down my feed to 2019 there's a

1573
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,079
bunch of pictures of it really pretty

1574
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:59,960
really really Frosty nug um it was kind

1575
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:03,880
of a it was kind of a short not very

1576
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:05,880
vigorous plant though um I doubt CSI has

1577
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,760
a cut of it anymore but but that's the

1578
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,440
one he wanted from me yeah um and then

1579
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:14,000
there was yeah like a couple

1580
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:16,358
T1000 um phenotypes which were shorter

1581
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,440
but like had great turps on them the bud

1582
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:20,358
was kind of

1583
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:23,039
leafy um but like so this this one that

1584
01:05:20,358 --> 01:05:26,000
I selected it had it was extremely

1585
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:30,079
vigorous top 10 % Vigor

1586
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,519
M um great CX to Leaf

1587
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,480
ratio the bud didn't really purple up

1588
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:37,880
like it can a little bit and I'm sure

1589
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:41,240
indoors it would be easier to manipulate

1590
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:44,119
yeah but but even even even growing out

1591
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:46,598
late in the fall like you might get some

1592
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:49,358
kexes near the stem to to purple up but

1593
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:53,359
it doesn't really want to purple up yeah

1594
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:55,440
and uh um it's it's got good potency

1595
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,838
it's got good yield Vigor like I said

1596
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,000
and then the main thing I was looking

1597
01:05:56,838 --> 01:06:00,318
for is like I want something with like

1598
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,719
big OG

1599
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:04,079
structure and and good yielding but I

1600
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:07,519
want some of that

1601
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,680
urel turps in in that flower in the

1602
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:12,358
flavor of it and it and it's the only

1603
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:15,639
one out of all of them that had that

1604
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:18,239
yeah so so that's why that's why I

1605
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:21,639
selected it that's why I've kept it um

1606
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:23,038
and I I I passed it to csi's brother and

1607
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:24,960
they grew it out last year and they're

1608
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,039
keeping it and they're still running it

1609
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,760
that's awesome which speaks a lot which

1610
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,200
like you got to give it to other people

1611
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,920
cuz like it's my baby but like until you

1612
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,118
give it to somebody else and and see

1613
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,960
what they think about it you know does

1614
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:39,480
it stay in their Garden or not you know

1615
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,199
how how good is it really you don't know

1616
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,000
because you're super biased and that's

1617
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,439
why tot that's why you pass it out like

1618
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,480
hey I think I got something good here

1619
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,798
try it yeah you know like I don't I

1620
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,960
don't want to pass on something that's

1621
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:54,400
bunk you know but I think it's good but

1622
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:58,079
like I also understand my own bias

1623
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:01,079
towards it yeah so it's just I'm I'm

1624
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,760
growing a bunch of It Outdoors right now

1625
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:06,839
um it's looking and smelling great I

1626
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:11,359
can't wait to smoke some um it's more

1627
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:13,358
flavorful than your traditional TK yeah

1628
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:16,400
because it's got those Urkle turps to it

1629
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:18,358
but it's got the TK potency yeah which

1630
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:22,519
is a tough thing to kind of try to match

1631
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:25,119
up for some reason urle CHS just mean

1632
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:28,199
low potency or sort of that more like

1633
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:30,559
lethargic High I mean look at cookies

1634
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:33,199
it's a to me in my opinion like some

1635
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:36,119
kind of OG heral hybrid like at so what

1636
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:38,399
you're seeing and there's not a lot of

1637
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:40,160
like people don't brag about screaming

1638
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,278
potency in cookies but it's like they're

1639
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,038
taking it One Direction and this is a

1640
01:07:42,278 --> 01:07:47,000
chance to take it a better Direction

1641
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:50,400
with more turbs and better potency I I

1642
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,239
think so um it's not it's not a pretty a

1643
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,200
plant as cookies is it's more

1644
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:58,318
traditional looking but it's got a

1645
01:07:54,199 --> 01:08:00,480
really good calx to leave so um I mean

1646
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,639
that that alone just kind of makes it

1647
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,240
and it and it I've grown it I've grown

1648
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:07,318
it indoors I've grown it in a very

1649
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:09,879
climate controlled Greenhouse I've grown

1650
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:13,278
It Outdoors yeah I've deed it in the

1651
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:17,480
middle of summer um it's different in

1652
01:08:13,278 --> 01:08:19,560
all in all of them it looks different so

1653
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:22,278
it it might check all the boxes

1654
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,839
depending on how you grow

1655
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:26,040
yeah I mean it's it was really pretty

1656
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:29,000
grown in my climate controlled

1657
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:30,359
greenhouse and grown indoors um I had a

1658
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,798
little bit more trouble trying to get it

1659
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:37,199
to yield there for some reason and I'm

1660
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:40,319
not sure why yet but um Outdoors or in

1661
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:43,119
adep um it's it it's

1662
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:46,560
chunky yeah yeah it's pretty I've seen

1663
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:49,679
pictures of it I want to smoke that yeah

1664
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,080
yeah all right then we have let's see

1665
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,079
what's the next one oh one more thing I

1666
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:55,600
called it Phoenix I called it Phoenix

1667
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,119
because it's the only mother I kept

1668
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,480
through the 2020 fire my whole place

1669
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:02,640
fire ran through my whole place and and

1670
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:07,158
I lost some structures uh I lost the

1671
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:10,079
crop for the most part um and uh it was

1672
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:12,759
a it was a very hectic uh fall that year

1673
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,359
to say the least and I'm still barely

1674
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:16,719
I'm still struggling to recover from it

1675
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:19,798
honestly but um that's why I called it

1676
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:22,039
the Phoenix it it needed a name the the

1677
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:23,798
the bat cross didn't really have a name

1678
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:26,079
I was calling it back to the triangle

1679
01:09:23,798 --> 01:09:28,319
for a while which which I thought was a

1680
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:30,278
good name um I think Caleb came up with

1681
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,679
that though

1682
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:35,600
um but then I've just decided to call it

1683
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:37,759
Phoenix and yeah be done with it well

1684
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,079
it's memorable that's for sure yeah

1685
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:43,640
totally all right uh we'll show some

1686
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:46,278

yeah yeah it was the Jack backcross mail

1695
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:15,519
it was a backcross mail that lauran uh

1696
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:17,678
originally did yeah and he was using

1697
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,440
that mail and then he gave the mail to

1698
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:23,760
707 seed bank and because he loved it so

1699
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,479
much and he made a [ __ ] ton of the same

1700
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,679
Ross that's awesome and uh this heart

1701
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:32,039
attack feno was just like one out of 10

1702
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:34,440
to one out of 20 would be this early

1703
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:37,238
flowering it was a little

1704
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:40,559
shorter um very

1705
01:10:37,238 --> 01:10:42,799
frosty um Jack TPS with like some like

1706
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,679
puke smell on the back

1707
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,960
end and uh not not the not the best

1708
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:51,199
flower like it could get really ly in

1709
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,960
the middle but it was early and that was

1710
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:57,000
that's that's why it it it appeals to me

1711
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,679
is you know back when I'm running

1712
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,679
outdoor I had my garden like basically

1713
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:04,440
four strains and I would start with like

1714
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,560
early you know middle late so the

1715
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:08,439
Harvest was always staggered in coming

1716
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,719
in because you only have limited dry

1717
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:14,238
space so yeah that was one of my earlies

1718
01:11:11,719 --> 01:11:16,920
along with purple wreck and

1719
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:20,158
uh yeah I I I grew the [ __ ] out of it

1720
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:22,399
for years um luckily my buyer didn't

1721
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:24,238
mind the the the Jack turps but which I

1722
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,799
know a lot of buyers just would thumb

1723
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:29,238
their noses out for a while yeah for

1724
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:32,679
sure and uh yeah I think I think that's

1725
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:34,359
changed especially on the legal side um

1726
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:36,399
yeah I'm sure you know these TPS come

1727
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:38,639
and go and Trends come and go and I

1728
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:41,158
think that uh a lot of people haven't

1729
01:11:38,639 --> 01:11:44,760
really had a good and it's like a pretty

1730
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:47,000
Bud too because it's so Frosty so um and

1731
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,480
it's good smoke it's tasty it's it's got

1732
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,880
a great High good potency it also washes

1733
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:55,359
really well yeah um so I think uh I

1734
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,800
don't know I think it'll make a comeback

1735
01:11:55,359 --> 01:12:00,679
so I'm gonna do a I'm gonna do a little

1736
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:04,480
feno hunt next year of it with some uh I

1737
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:07,239
made I made f2s with it so I took a few

1738
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:09,638
Kush cleaner uh males and and crossed

1739
01:12:07,238 --> 01:12:12,919
them to the heart attack cut that I was

1740
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:16,639
that I was using and it's it's based on

1741
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:19,079
directional F2 oh is it a directional

1742
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:21,520
F2 because I used that one female I

1743
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:25,198
wanted right so yeah and then just

1744
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:27,880
multiple males just to you know get

1745
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:29,519
everything in the mix so there was one

1746
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,159
you just mentioned and we almost forgot

1747
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,080
and that's the purple rack which is

1748
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:34,879
absolute one of my favorites of all time

1749
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:36,960
for sure yeah purple wreck was also

1750
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:40,119
really early funny story about that one

1751
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,880
I also got that from 40 ounce um I think

1752
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:44,119
I got it the same time I got the the

1753
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,480
poodle nuts he bought the seeds from

1754
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:50,760
from DNA yeah um it was the Reserva pada

1755
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:52,519
line which yeah I came out later to find

1756
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,360
was just seeds they bought from guys up

1757
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:59,360
here in NorCal yeah one of my one of my

1758
01:12:56,359 --> 01:13:01,319
one of my friends up here uh he

1759
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,639
accidentally seated his garden one year

1760
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:04,920
because he missed a

1761
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:08,960
mail and

1762
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:12,319
uh I forget what line that was it was

1763
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:15,039
like I want to say it was like oldtime

1764
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:17,479
something maybe the Sweet Tooth or God I

1765
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:21,079
don't remember which line it was but he

1766
01:13:17,479 --> 01:13:23,439
sold them all that seed and they bought

1767
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:25,079
it I don't know I don't what was

1768
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,839
whatever that you could probably find it

1769
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:30,679
in in their old catalog or something

1770
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,400
whatever that line was but then so I get

1771
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:34,560
this and it's like it's great weed it's

1772
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:38,158
like it's like train wreck on a on a

1773
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:41,239
shorter plant uh still purples up you

1774
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:44,198
know really good yielder like absolutely

1775
01:13:41,238 --> 01:13:46,959
chunky um super dense buds but still

1776
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:50,439
dense but like a train wreck yeah

1777
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,679
structure to the bud yeah and and still

1778
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:54,079
had rubbery stems it was just a shorter

1779
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:55,079
plant

1780
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:57,800
and

1781
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:59,639
uh you know I'm I'm showing some jars to

1782
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,560
at a friend's house in Humble one day

1783
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:04,440
and and uh I probably had the poodle

1784
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,120
nuts with me and I forget what else I

1785
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:08,519
had but maybe some Sour Diesel and I had

1786
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,039
showed him this purple wreck and we were

1787
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:13,320
just talking about and he's like oh yeah

1788
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:17,399
I I made these

1789
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:19,359
seeds so he uh he made a couple of

1790
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:21,198
crosses and sold them to DNA and then

1791
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:22,759
like you know I Circle back around I

1792
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:25,119
didn't even know this person at the time

1793
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:29,639
and yeah and then now now he's a really

1794
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:30,920
good friend and uh I brought him the

1795
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:32,600
from the seed he we waited he never

1796
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,800
found a phenotype like that when he

1797
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,239
popped the seed that's funny like that

1798
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,960
he's like [ __ ] this is the one I was

1799
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:42,399
looking for so funny they g a lot of

1800
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,719
popularity um it got brought out to

1801
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,439
Colorado it was popular there for a

1802
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,600
while I had a buddy in hoping grow it

1803
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:49,359
for a long

1804
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,360
time

1805
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:54,119
um

1806
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:56,479
uh I grew it I grew It Outdoors for a

1807
01:14:54,119 --> 01:15:00,319
long time just because it it was early

1808
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:03,039
it was Heavy um it kept its smell you

1809
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:06,880
know you know until well into the next

1810
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,760
year um the high was me you know it's

1811
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,159
kind of

1812
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,480
irly you know but other than that like

1813
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:15,158
it it checked every other box like huge

1814
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:17,479
yields or huge yield potential early

1815
01:15:15,158 --> 01:15:19,679
just those that's just all that's

1816
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:22,279
winners uh purple wreck was one of the

1817
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,520
first urle uh strains I could smoke

1818
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:26,079
where it wouldn't give me Paro instantly

1819
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,920
that's what URL was always one of the

1820
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:32,559
ones that got me so bad every time still

1821
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:35,279
is it was like this one was like 20%

1822
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,000
Urkel and like mostly train wreck but

1823
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:39,639
you could kind of taste and smell the

1824
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,238
KKL like on the back end which just kind

1825
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:44,159
of nice about it and I mean I love train

1826
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:45,959
wreck back in the day that was one of

1827
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:48,119
the reasons I wanted to start growing is

1828
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,000
so I could grow my own train wreck and

1829
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:53,000
yeah of course I couldn't get a clone of

1830
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,639
it so of course not yeah I mean and then

1831
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,279
and then then once I did I grew it out

1832
01:15:54,639 --> 01:15:58,039
once and it was like oh this is great

1833
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:59,719
and then I got a Urkle cut and I'm like

1834
01:15:58,039 --> 01:16:03,158
on to the next

1835
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:04,960
one after the big hunt right right yeah

1836
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:07,399
after finally tracking it down after

1837
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:10,158
many years I grew I grew some s1's out I

1838
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:12,479
grew some hybrids from uh from JoJo

1839
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:17,479
Rizzo and they were good I grew his s1's

1840
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:20,959
out they were good um his uh Sour Diesel

1841
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:22,718
Crystal locomotive was awesome Yep um I

1842
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,679
don't yeah no I did grow Crystal

1843
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:26,560
locomotive too just pure and that was

1844
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:29,480
also really Frosty it just wasn't train

1845
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:32,880
wreck yeah um but those s1s were train

1846
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:34,919
wreck for sure yeah just locomotives is

1847
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,000
[ __ ] totally underrated strain from back

1848
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,920
in the day yeah I had some of those

1849
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,399
seeds in my lost seed stash as well I

1850
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,639
still got some in the fridge from a

1851
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:47,920
friend so yeah you ever want to run them

1852
01:16:43,639 --> 01:16:49,719
they're there um all right so now we

1853
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,600
could talk about something maybe more

1854
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:53,679
modern that's in your garden which is

1855
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,239
the uh Mochi runs

1856
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,480
you want to talk about that a little bit

1857
01:16:55,238 --> 01:17:01,039
sure Mochi runs is just a shot in the

1858
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:03,919
darkk uh strain I bought from a nursery

1859
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:06,479
just clones I bought from a nursery

1860
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,079
um just wanting to run something that

1861
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:11,919
kind of like was what the market was

1862
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:14,198
wanting which is candy gas and uh I was

1863
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:18,480
I was pleasantly surprised with how well

1864
01:17:14,198 --> 01:17:19,879
it grew it a lot of vigor a tall plant

1865
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:21,399
really really

1866
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,159
Frosty

1867
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:28,319
um great you know has that runt

1868
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:30,719
smell um I don't know who bred it yeah

1869
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:34,198
um I don't even know if if if if that

1870
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:38,399
Nursery selected it or not

1871
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:41,079
but just just a just a great plant

1872
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:44,198
for what the market wants right now just

1873
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:46,800
great for a grower and runs is fine I'm

1874
01:17:44,198 --> 01:17:49,960
not super into growing runs I don't

1875
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,840
really want to grow runs um but this

1876
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:54,198
plant just I don't know it's all the

1877
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,199
things that runs is but like without the

1878
01:17:54,198 --> 01:18:00,719
headache of a of a kind of a finicky

1879
01:17:56,198 --> 01:18:02,439
plant yeah yeah so that's not bad at all

1880
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:05,639
and one nice thing about runs is it

1881
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:09,319
doesn't want a lot of food and I don't

1882
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:12,719
feed a lot you know and so I don't push

1883
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:14,519
my plants very hard um I you know I feel

1884
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,880
like that's one of the ways just to [ __ ]

1885
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,880
up the flavor of it and I

1886
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,719
agree definitely one of the ways you can

1887
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,679
get light yields too if you don't if you

1888
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,639
don't have it dialed in but um yeah for

1889
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:27,960
sure

1890
01:18:24,639 --> 01:18:32,560
uh it yeah it's got that it's not super

1891
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:34,399
it's not super hungry like uh like uh

1892
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,400
like well I mean a runs plant is not

1893
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:38,399
super hungry so I I appreciate that some

1894
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:39,799
of the some of the purples can be like

1895
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,519
you know food

1896
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:44,560
ODS and uh I don't know just just good

1897
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,679
weed and honestly I don't know what's

1898
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,880
Mochi about it or I know nothing about

1899
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:53,000
it just a shot in the dark yeah you know

1900
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,760
so who knows right yeah I think uh

1901
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,880
supposed to be aochi gelato cross to

1902
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,880
runs if I remember correctly but okay I

1903
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,279
don't know what any of that means yeah

1904
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,039
that's probably that's I mean it

1905
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:05,920
probably is what it is but yeah who

1906
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:09,158
knows it could be ice cream cake to runs

1907
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:11,079
who knows yeah right yeah all right

1908
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:15,039
let's get into some philosophical stuff

1909
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:16,719
here um what's hedes for you uh and and

1910
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:18,198
how much do you hes and how much do you

1911
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,719
grow for yourself and for your own

1912
01:19:18,198 --> 01:19:22,238
tastes I mean you talked a little bit

1913
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:24,840
about this but like so what's Hees for

1914
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:27,519
you man I know I got some headies from

1915
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:30,159
old SG this winter he he grew some

1916
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:33,800
Destroyer out which is like I think it's

1917
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:36,000
Tai Colombian yeah it's a meow

1918
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:38,560
Tha yeah I think you're right something

1919
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,039
like that yeah he sent me a bunch of

1920
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:44,280
different phenotypes and one of them the

1921
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:49,600
number five was just a [ __ ] head

1922
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:52,840
ringer so good um absolute head ringer

1923
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,719
Head and Shoulders more potent than than

1924
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,679
then all the other phenotypes he sent me

1925
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,560
yeah that was that's what I would call

1926
01:19:56,679 --> 01:20:01,960
some

1927
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:03,560
Hees um for myself like I grow

1928
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:08,198
especially this year I'm growing way too

1929
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:09,760
many strains so I'll just snag what I

1930
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:11,359
like the

1931
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,480
most

1932
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:17,359
um so I mean this year it's definitely

1933
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:20,519
going to be those poodle nuts s1's it's

1934
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:22,920
definitely G to be some of the Skittles

1935

uh phenotypes from the Skittles sherb

1936
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:29,440

1937
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:33,039
well um Mochi runs for

1938
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:35,678
sure uh Phoenix for sure it's just

1939
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:38,000
basically I like I like smoking

1940
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:40,760
flavorful stuff I don't care about

1941
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,319
potency as much because it all gets me

1942
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,960
high and if I'll just smoke more if I if

1943
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,960
I need to get more stoned like I'll

1944
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:51,000
smoke M perss all day and I'll just I'll

1945
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:53,600
just smoke twice as much you know yeah

1946
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,039
um because M pers isn't potent but

1947
01:20:53,600 --> 01:21:00,000
correct super

1948
01:20:55,039 --> 01:21:03,119

1963
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:46,800
serious head ringer so um I'll

1964
01:21:44,198 --> 01:21:48,559

1965

actual Skittles pure Skittles going too

1969
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,960
I'll definitely be keeping a few jars of

1970
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:06,760

1971
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:09,359
just so tasty it is very tasty yeah so

1972
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,920
like the tastiest weed that that's

1973
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:15,920
that's what's in my jars for the most

1974
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:18,560
part you know trying to understand what

1975
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,199
something is I'm growing you know but

1976
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,000
like if I don't like it I'm not even

1977
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:24,799
going to get through the jar you know

1978
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,039
yeah I'm with you

1979
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:30,920
yeah that makes sense I mean hes hes is

1980
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:33,800
different for everyone and I I think it

1981
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:35,440
just tends to be Whatever Gets You takes

1982
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,119
the edge off that you like the most

1983
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:38,479
whatever Edge need to be taken off that

1984
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,279
you like the most and it sounds like

1985
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:42,759
even though you grow for the market

1986
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:46,319
you're still growing stuff that suits

1987
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:48,560
what you love still yeah well I I find

1988
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:51,840
that e like bulk for Market but you can

1989
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,920
still get off the stuff that's good that

1990
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:58,079
maybe

1991
01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:00,600
isn't going to check that box of super

1992
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:03,519
high THC with the strain everybody wants

1993
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:05,239
um yeah and you know some people's hes

1994
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:09,400
has to be potent because they smoke a

1995
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:13,238
lot and and I totally get that but you

1996
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:15,839
know I'm a timeand place smoker so um it

1997
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:18,678
it doesn't so I can and I like smoking

1998
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,119
tasty stuff yeah do you ever smoke

1999
01:23:18,679 --> 01:23:23,119
extracts or anything like that not so

2000
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:25,559
much anymore

2001
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:26,679
um I don't I don't make them either

2002
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:29,800
anymore

2003
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:33,480
so um no I don't dab I stopped dabbing a

2004
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:36,159
long time ago um I just my tolerance is

2005
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,039
not that high yeah and I mean dabbing

2006
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:41,158
just you know sends sends you through

2007
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:44,600
the roof so it's always weird for me

2008
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:46,198
like I can I can dab just fine and not I

2009
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:49,000
don't know it doesn't really affect my

2010
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:50,399
tolerance with flow I don't know why but

2011
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,520
it's so weird like I get so much more

2012
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,839
high off flower than I do off dabs like

2013
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:57,159

2043
01:25:12,198 --> 01:25:16,799
my neighbor so like I'm supporting them

2044
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:18,759
over some [ __ ] company you know yeah

2045
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,639
and that matters to a lot of people

2046
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,000
totally should

2047
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,600
should all right here's a here's a

2048
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,198
philosophical topic that I'm really

2049
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:28,119
interested in with the the breeder

2050
01:25:26,198 --> 01:25:30,759
Syndicate a lot of what I've been trying

2051
01:25:28,118 --> 01:25:32,960
to do is a group based effort to kind of

2052
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,760
push back on kind of everything going on

2053
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,520
in uh a push of education but you've

2054
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,840
talked a lot about like the difference

2055
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:42,600
between unions and co-ops I believe is

2056
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,719
what the way you had worded it can you

2057
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,920
talk a little bit more about that

2058
01:25:43,719 --> 01:25:46,399
because that's like something I'm super

2059
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,800
interested in and I don't really know

2060
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:51,359
the definition between the difference

2061
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,320
between union and Co-op okay yeah so I

2062
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:55,479
mean I'm talking Co co-ops and people

2063
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:58,519
say unions sometime like Growers need a

2064
01:25:55,479 --> 01:26:01,479
union like no we need a co-op unions for

2065
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,760
labor for for labor to organize and and

2066
01:26:01,479 --> 01:26:05,919
get better rates and get treated better

2067
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:08,600
and I'm all for that you know that's a

2068
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:11,118
good thing because you know businesses

2069
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,719
take advantage especially if they have a

2070
01:26:11,118 --> 01:26:15,639
monopoly on the employment or if they

2071
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:19,439
collude with each other you know to keep

2072
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:23,000
wages low to to enrich themselves um

2073
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:26,198
co-ops is for producers

2074
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:29,079
um small mainly small producers but I

2075
01:26:26,198 --> 01:26:31,759
mean it could be big producers but but

2076
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:34,479
really we're talking small producers

2077
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:37,920
that can't afford to Market themselves

2078
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:40,000
can't afford to um capture these

2079
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:45,880
economies of scale that the big boys

2080
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:48,359
have yeah and so so sunkiss did this

2081
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:50,639
with orange growers uh Ocean Spray did

2082
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:53,198
this with uh

2083
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:55,440
cranberries you know

2084
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:57,599
Ocean Spray that name that everybody

2085
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:59,238
knows because like you think Ocean Spray

2086
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,639
you think cranberries that's yeah that's

2087
01:26:59,238 --> 01:27:04,959
what they do

2088
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:06,359
um the the the cranberry Growers like

2089
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,079
probably up in New England or somewhere

2090
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:12,639
started it and it's just a brand they

2091
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:14,519
started and

2092
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:16,760
collectively um you know they're selling

2093
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,520
their cam cranberries through this brand

2094
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:21,600
they're they're they're licensing the

2095
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:24,159
name that maybe some other company buys

2096
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,199
their CR berries through the co-op yeah

2097
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:27,559
and then they licens the brand the the

2098
01:27:26,198 --> 01:27:29,118
oceans spray name so you want to make

2099
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:32,400
juice with them you want to make sauce

2100
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:35,960
with them or or whatever the case may be

2101
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:37,399
um there's a lot of value in that name

2102
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:40,279
so those

2103
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:42,920
Growers are negotiating better prices

2104
01:27:40,279 --> 01:27:45,039
because now that Co-op is one of the big

2105
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:48,158
players collectively made up of many

2106
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:49,800
small farms absolutely now together

2107
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:51,599
they're one of the major players and if

2108
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,480
you did the same thing with cannabis and

2109
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:57,199
took all the 10,000 squ foot Farms up

2110
01:27:54,479 --> 01:28:00,359
here you'd have I don't know how many

2111
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:02,719
acres 80 acres of canopy space which is

2112
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:05,000
a ton of weed which would make us one of

2113
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:06,800
the biggest players in

2114
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
cannabis

2115
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:12,279
um you you you'd have them collectively

2116
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
marketing and and creating brands for

2117
01:28:12,279 --> 01:28:15,960
all that product to flow through and

2118
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,198
since the Growers own the brand they

2119
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:20,039
capture that added value yeah so now

2120
01:28:18,198 --> 01:28:22,759
they're not selling wholesale or they

2121
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:24,840
are selling wholesale to the co-op but

2122
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:27,280
then they have equity in the brand so

2123
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,719
they captured some of the markups right

2124
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:31,559
yeah and and and and and that's really

2125
01:28:29,719 --> 01:28:33,439
what it comes down to like individually

2126
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:36,520
we can't afford to hit every store and

2127
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:39,319
try and sell our product you know and

2128
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:41,960
the cost of marketing the cost of sales

2129
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:43,039
the cost of packaging all those things

2130
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:46,439
can

2131
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:49,079
be combined so everybody pays a little

2132
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:52,238
piece and then we capture all the value

2133
01:28:49,079 --> 01:28:54,198
and I ideally it's a big enough company

2134
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:56,599
that you know it could even vertically

2135
01:28:54,198 --> 01:28:59,000
integrate at some point and instead of

2136
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:01,400
striking distribution deals and extract

2137
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,679
deals and edible deals and and all these

2138
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:07,319
things we could all just do it in house

2139
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:10,000
or we license our brand which would be

2140
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:12,039
the only authentic brand in cannabis you

2141
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,960
know FL Cana tried to do that they tried

2142
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:16,359
to co-op the image of the small Farmer

2143
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:18,560
for themselves yes they did but at the

2144
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:21,319
end of the day all they cared about was

2145
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,679
raising a bunch of money to get to tell

2146
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:24,399
investors look look at all this weed

2147
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:25,679
we're going to get from these guys you

2148
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:27,839
know and look how much product we're

2149
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,440
going to move and give us these

2150
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,920
Investments and they're great at doing

2151
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:33,079
that but what they were shitty at was

2152
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:36,279
selling weed yeah and treating the

2153
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:38,920
farmer right so yeah rather than just

2154
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:41,599
co-opting an image like we are what we

2155
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:44,440
say we are it's not an image it's us

2156
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:46,600
yeah you know so we'd be the only

2157
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:48,359
authentic brand in cannabis there's

2158
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,239
there's dairies that that do this too

2159
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:53,039
like

2160
01:29:49,238 --> 01:29:55,000
tillamuk yeah it's just

2161
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:56,639
you know let us all do this in-house and

2162
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,238
let these small farmers that are forced

2163
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,800
to sell wholesale and barely I mean

2164
01:29:59,238 --> 01:30:03,479
you're either barely making it or you're

2165
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,840
slowly dying absolutely for sure but if

2166
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:06,359
I could get a hundred more dollars a

2167
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:09,039
pound at the end of the day whether it

2168
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:11,000
be through you know some type of

2169
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:13,359
dividend at the end of the year or or

2170
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,920
however it would work like that that

2171
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:16,880
makes it all happen now I'm making a

2172
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:18,399
living like it's just farming the

2173
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,719
margins are tight they're probably going

2174
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:22,799
to they're going to be tight forever

2175
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:24,319
that's fine I just want to make a Liv

2176
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,480
yeah you know at the end of the day

2177
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:28,198
that's it and it's tough to do selling

2178
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:30,678
wholesale and competing on wholesale

2179
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:32,638
prices with the glass houses that are

2180
01:30:30,679 --> 01:30:35,279
just putting out thousands of pounds a

2181
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,920
month and it's terrible and it drives

2182
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:39,158
the price down on everybody I mean

2183
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:41,880
that's their [ __ ] business plan is to

2184
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:43,359
drive the price down so low and just

2185
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:45,039
they can afford to take losses they can

2186
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:46,238
afford to take losses for ear money

2187
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:49,399
because they've got all this investor

2188
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:51,279
money to to collapse the market and then

2189
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:54,118
hopefully they want to be the last

2190
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,599
standing yep you know exactly so if

2191
01:30:54,118 --> 01:30:57,880
they're the last ones

2192
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,520
standing and all these small farms up

2193
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:01,159
here go out of business these towns go

2194
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,360
out of business the whole economy up

2195
01:31:01,158 --> 01:31:05,359
here goes out of business your your

2196
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:07,439
friends everybody's in the weed business

2197
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:09,279
up here in some aspect whether it's

2198
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:12,079
you're an accountant working for a bunch

2199
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:15,079
of Growers or [ __ ] hell even the [ __ ]

2200
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:17,118
police you know like grows what are they

2201
01:31:15,079 --> 01:31:18,639
gonna do with all their time what are

2202
01:31:17,118 --> 01:31:20,439
the [ __ ] most of their families are

2203
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,520
involved in the grows like realistic I

2204
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:22,919
mean their families are involved in the

2205
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,000
grow they've been making a living

2206
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,800
robbing Growers for for years exactly

2207
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,399
they're funding if if there's no if they

2208
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,960
don't get plant counts and they're going

2209
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:35,118
to lose their budgets and which means

2210
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,118
they're gonna have to cut jobs and so I

2211
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:40,519
mean know I hope they do lose their jobs

2212
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:44,079
some some aspect I want to stay in

2213
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:45,960
business so you know you know the whole

2214
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:47,639
economy is tied up with this thing and

2215
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,560
if you go down Main Street like

2216
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:52,719
Garberville or Hayfork these towns that

2217
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:56,920
are like 100% pot for the most part

2218
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:59,719
90% there's no tourism there's no um

2219
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:03,600
really other viable industry yeah um

2220
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:05,039
maybe logging a little bit but um you

2221
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,719
know it's just a bunch of shuttered

2222
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:09,158
businesses yeah and that means that that

2223
01:32:07,719 --> 01:32:10,960
many Less jobs now the people that

2224
01:32:09,158 --> 01:32:12,719
worked at that restaurant you know the

2225
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:16,039
the the 15 people it employed they don't

2226
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:18,118
have jobs now you know up in northal

2227
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:20,920
right now like Trinity Holt Mendo like

2228
01:32:18,118 --> 01:32:23,118
is it looking can you visually see

2229
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:25,600
places closing down because oh yeah yeah

2230
01:32:23,118 --> 01:32:28,079
yeah absolutely like you can see a whole

2231
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,719
strip in a building of all the

2232
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:30,439
businesses are are shutter they're

2233
01:32:29,719 --> 01:32:34,000
they're

2234
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:36,079
done as a result of the weed Market as a

2235
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,600
as a result of the collapse of the weed

2236
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:42,880
Market yeah yeah absolutely sad totally

2237
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,600
yeah I mean it these are these are

2238
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,199
businesses that technically have nothing

2239
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,880
to do with Wei now of course the grow

2240
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:50,439
stores have all Consolidated so there's

2241
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:54,159
only a few bigger ones left yeah yeah

2242
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:55,799
which which is is fine um it was bigger

2243
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:57,519
go home because for a while like

2244
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:00,000
everybody wanted to open a grow store

2245
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:02,840
and they did so every little

2246
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,520
hole might be a good grow store and half

2247
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,159
the time they're just doing it to get

2248
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:10,199
you know super discounts for their own

2249
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:11,599
grow yeah right you know and so I don't

2250
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:13,559
know there's there's there's still a few

2251
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,600
up here that are that are gonna survive

2252
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:18,400
but like yeah go through hay for just

2253
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:22,840
shuttered businesses restaurants um

2254

moving there's there's just not as many

2256
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:31,880
people now and so yeah I mean it's it's

2257
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:34,760
a real thing the the economy up here has

2258
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:37,960
always been Boomer bust it's since since

2259

2264
01:33:51,118 --> 01:33:56,439

natural resource extraction business

2266
01:33:56,439 --> 01:34:02,960
it's all boom and bust and when logging

2267
01:33:59,079 --> 01:34:05,118
busted in the 80s 70s 80s um all these

2268
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:07,198
little Mill towns you know lost their

2269
01:34:05,118 --> 01:34:09,039
Mill which was their main source of jobs

2270
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,279
which is why the town was created in the

2271
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:13,600
first place you know the people just

2272
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,759
kind of stuck around and grew weed yeah

2273
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,880
right and the towns didn't die and then

2274
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,320
medical came through and and created a

2275
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:23,279
huge new a revive the

2276
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:24,639
boom and you had the green Rush which

2277
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,519
you know these Town these little towns

2278
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:29,520
were humming in the spring and in

2279
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:32,000
harvest season humming like every other

2280
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:34,400
truck had like was full of like supplies

2281
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,319
and potting soil and you know it brought

2282
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:39,960
tourism from the migrant trimmers ton

2283
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:42,399
yeah tons of business um yeah you'd had

2284
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:44,319
all the trimmers come in the fall yeah

2285
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:46,079
and I mean you know they would be in

2286
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:48,960
town spending their cash at night you

2287
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:51,118
know at the bar or buying clothes or or

2288
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,880
whatever you know they they they you

2289
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:55,279
know they brought a back Bunch back home

2290
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:57,520
but like they still spent money there

2291
01:34:55,279 --> 01:35:00,840
yeah like go to any bar during harvest

2292
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:03,400
season on like a Friday night and it was

2293
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:04,719
packed you know shoulder toosh shoulder

2294
01:35:03,399 --> 01:35:07,118
and most of the people didn't speak

2295
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:09,639
English it was awesome it fun you know

2296
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:12,559
people from all over the place yeah and

2297
01:35:09,639 --> 01:35:14,719
uh so it's it's not like that

2298
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,800
anymore because you don't have this huge

2299
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:19,639
influx of of people and you know if you

2300
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:22,039
weren't in the pot industry and hated

2301
01:35:19,639 --> 01:35:23,520
pot or cannabis for some reason because

2302
01:35:22,039 --> 01:35:25,800
you know you're just like that which

2303
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,480
there are people up here like that sure

2304
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:29,560
all they see is the negative aspects of

2305
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:31,638
it even if they're like even if they're

2306
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:34,320
benefiting financially like even if

2307
01:35:31,639 --> 01:35:36,960
their Plumbing business or you know

2308
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:38,880
whatever business is still benefiting

2309
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,399
yeah um they would you know they look

2310
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:43,199
they see all the people on the street

2311
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:45,799
and they would get all grumpy about it

2312
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:47,000
and I don't know man it's just like

2313
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,639
that's probably what it looked like in

2314
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,520
the early logging years and the early

2315
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:52,199
Gold Rush years was there just like

2316
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:56,040
people on the street you know trying to

2317
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:57,799
get on you know and so I mean that's how

2318
01:35:56,039 --> 01:36:00,519
their anwers probably ancestors probably

2319
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:02,920
showed up here the same way so I don't

2320
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:05,679
know you know so it's it's sad to see

2321
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:08,359
and it's sad to see a whole like sort of

2322
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:10,118
culture and Industry up here sort of

2323
01:36:08,359 --> 01:36:13,359
slowly die

2324
01:36:10,118 --> 01:36:16,519
or it's it's dying it's transitioning to

2325
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:18,479
something else but I just feel like if

2326
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:22,679
we could

2327
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:24,359
Empower all the small Growers to unite

2328
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:26,840
and this has been tried and people are

2329
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:28,719
still trying to do it now yeah um I've

2330
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:30,960
definitely tried and I'm just trying to

2331
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:34,158
like spread the idea to people that like

2332
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,239
oh [ __ ] like this could work yeah it's

2333
01:36:34,158 --> 01:36:39,158
tough to get Growers to agree on things

2334
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:40,919
and as soon as you join something that's

2335
01:36:39,158 --> 01:36:44,559
the last time you get everything your

2336
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:48,440
way yep so it's it's very it's very

2337
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:51,000
difficult um a lot of us are

2338
01:36:48,439 --> 01:36:53,678
Growers yeah United we're we're the

2339
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,158
biggest player in the industry um we

2340
01:36:53,679 --> 01:37:00,399
have the best product we have um the

2341
01:36:57,158 --> 01:37:03,079
best genetics we have I mean just the

2342
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:05,759
knowhow up here the knowledge base um

2343
01:37:03,079 --> 01:37:10,840
and every facet of growing including

2344
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:13,119
compliance and um extraction and like

2345
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:15,440
most of the innovators are up here you

2346
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:17,639
know and especially on the traditional

2347
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:20,599
side like that's the real heart of the

2348
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:22,118
of the culture and that's still up here

2349
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:23,840
as well

2350
01:37:22,118 --> 01:37:26,238
and all those genetics that people have

2351
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,600
never seen before are still up here yeah

2352
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:30,279
a lot of it was generational yeah

2353
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:33,520
totally and

2354
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:35,759
so I don't know just like to me it's a

2355
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,560
no-brainer but it's just it's very hard

2356
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:41,360
to get people to come together yeah it

2357
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:43,159
is and uh it it certainly is helping

2358
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:45,479
right now that the price is so low and

2359
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:47,439
people are realizing that like oh [ __ ]

2360
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:50,759
like but damn like if I could just

2361
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:53,598
package up my ounces and get like 30

2362
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:56,039
bucks or 40 bucks an ounce like that's

2363
01:37:53,599 --> 01:37:59,159
more money than I'm getting wholesaling

2364
01:37:56,039 --> 01:38:01,639
right now so but like oh [ __ ] now like

2365
01:37:59,158 --> 01:38:03,279
how am I going to do sales well you know

2366
01:38:01,639 --> 01:38:05,039
like why don't you get together with all

2367
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:08,920
the other Farms on your

2368
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:10,960
road and and and and make one one brand

2369
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:14,840
and everybody just chips in to buy those

2370
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:16,520
10,000 myar bags yeah and and and and

2371
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:19,639
you fill them up with the best stuff you

2372
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:22,360
have and you you know you you hire

2373
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:24,199
somebody to do sales and so like you're

2374
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:26,079
all paying one person so you're just

2375
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:27,879
paying like you know one fifth of that

2376
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:31,238
person's commission or salary or however

2377
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:33,279
it works yeah yeah you know so I don't

2378
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:35,118
know that's that's my dream that's what

2379
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:38,840
I think could be the savior of of a lot

2380
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:40,238
of people like me that like that are I

2381
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:43,400
mean if I was in this for the money I'd

2382
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:44,959
have quit already oh yeah sure you know

2383
01:38:43,399 --> 01:38:46,799
the money was nice like there's no

2384
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,639
avoiding there's no getting around that

2385
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,480
like that was good I wouldn't be here

2386
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:54,000
without it because how else how the hell

2387
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:56,399
else would I buy land yeah exactly yeah

2388
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,920
but you know I would have left a long

2389
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:00,679
time ago and a lot of people have

2390
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:02,158
they've it's like okay this this isn't

2391
01:39:00,679 --> 01:39:03,920
profitable anymore I'm gonna go on and

2392
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:05,519
do something else or live somewhere else

2393
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,000
or on the flip side of what you just

2394

a lot of people didn't they bought toys

2396
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:14,880
and didn't reinvest their money into

2397
01:39:12,439 --> 01:39:17,678
this all I ever wanted to do is grow

2408
01:39:42,679 --> 01:39:47,880
boy if anybody sees this that you know

2409
01:39:45,198 --> 01:39:51,919
if you're a legal grower

2410
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:54,599
um hit me up on Instagram or something

2411
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,319
you know it's going to take like Minds

2412
01:39:54,599 --> 01:39:58,239
to get through all this it really is

2413
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:59,399
like I I've seen no other way through

2414
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:01,479
this when I started the breeder

2415
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:04,238
Syndicate like the name the idea behind

2416
01:40:01,479 --> 01:40:06,319
the name it's like a a bringing together

2417
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:08,319
of a group of people like Minds like

2418
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:12,679
that want to come together and achieve a

2419
01:40:08,319 --> 01:40:14,679
goal and yeah I want I see what what I

2420
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:17,480
was seeing when I was starting this was

2421
01:40:14,679 --> 01:40:18,960
humble Menino Trinity County I'm not

2422
01:40:17,479 --> 01:40:20,439
even from there but I have a lot of

2423
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,520
friends that are from there and their

2424
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:24,559
families are there and I care about them

2425
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,719
and I realized oh my God no one no one

2426
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,400
that's been doing this their whole life

2427
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:29,920
has retirement plans there's just no

2428
01:40:27,399 --> 01:40:32,719
retirement plans and there there are

2429
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:34,520
things we can do to make it a softer

2430
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,158
landing pad for a lot of people who pay

2431
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:37,599
the way for us to be here and there's

2432
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:40,039
ways to do it there's things you can

2433
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:42,639
establish and and even thinking about

2434
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:45,118
[ __ ] like that seems very pie in the sky

2435
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:47,039
or or thinking about having a a

2436
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:49,198
conglomeration of people to push back

2437
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:51,599
against the legal Market by bringing one

2438
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:54,879
Big Brand together seems very p

2439
01:40:51,599 --> 01:40:57,960
so doable it really is you know it it

2440
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:59,560
it's and it's been done before exactly

2441
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:01,599
and there's also there's all these other

2442
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:04,960
small co-ops you never hear about but

2443
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:08,000
they're just buyer co-ops for like so

2444
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:10,319
that Mom and Pop hardware stores can buy

2445
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,198
drywall yeah at a cheap enough price to

2446
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:16,399
compete with Home Depot y buy all that

2447
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:18,238
company exists for is to just buy

2448
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:19,719
drywall and bulk and distribute it to

2449
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:21,678
all these like Mom and Pop hardware

2450
01:41:19,719 --> 01:41:23,880
stores yep

2451
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:27,000
and they do exist and and they allow Mom

2452
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:30,199
and Pop to survive and compete you know

2453
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,439
by capturing economies of scale and and

2454
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:36,559
uh you know that's that's that's what

2455
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:39,198
it's all about I mean even just in the

2456
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:40,800
legal realm you know like when it

2457
01:41:39,198 --> 01:41:42,359
happened like you know half my friends

2458
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,000
converted to legal and half of them

2459
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:48,519
didn't yeah

2460
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,920
and most of them are not growing anymore

2461
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:53,400
on E it doesn't matter which side yeah

2462
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:55,760
but but most of them most of them aren't

2463
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:58,960
you know either they went legal and then

2464
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:02,280
gave up on that and and and went back to

2465
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:06,920
the to the traditional side or or they

2466
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:10,039
got jobs yeah you know and the people on

2467
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:11,840
the traditional side you know they've

2468
01:42:10,039 --> 01:42:13,880
gone from outdoor to indoor because

2469
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,599
there's there's tougher enforcement now

2470
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:16,800
and and and they're they're red tagging

2471
01:42:15,599 --> 01:42:18,800
your

2472
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:21,639
property so everybody's kind of

2473
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,760
transitioned a little bit and you know

2474
01:42:21,639 --> 01:42:26,679
just depending on how how well you were

2475
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:29,480
situated for the transition it was a lot

2476
01:42:26,679 --> 01:42:31,000
of it was just luck that I'm still here

2477
01:42:29,479 --> 01:42:33,678
I've I've been fortunate to have a lot

2478
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,760
of good luck and it's just by like it's

2479
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:37,639
dumb luck it's not I didn't foresee

2480
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:40,639
everything working out how it did it

2481
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:42,639
just happened to work out that it it

2482
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:44,719
worked out for me because just I

2483
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:47,279
happened to have a a good property for

2484
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:50,000
it you know yeah and and I've made

2485
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:52,319
sacrifices to have that property well

2486
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,118
that's the part that's not luck right

2487
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:55,799
like that's the part that's not luck and

2488
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:57,279
there are Reas you can make it's kind of

2489
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:00,639
luck man

2490
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:03,759
like you built

2491
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:06,319
it when it comes down to it

2492
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:08,840
like yeah like I could I could have

2493
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:11,639
easily bought a property closer to town

2494
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:14,480
that wasn't so remote and tough to get

2495
01:43:11,639 --> 01:43:18,159
to I mean that was kind of good for the

2496
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:21,319
old days but it's a huge pain in the ass

2497
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:22,759
now to live a life but at the same time

2498
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:26,039
I never could have afforded this

2499
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:27,440
property close to town it's you know

2500
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:30,479
it's it was cheap because it was so

2501
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:32,559
remote I mean that's that's all it comes

2502
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:34,919
down to it's it's 90 minutes away from

2503
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:37,199
any type of town and whoa that's out

2504
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:39,880
there bro oh it's out there yeah it's

2505
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:42,039
definitely out there and that used to be

2506
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:44,719
a good thing and now it's now it's not

2507
01:43:42,039 --> 01:43:47,760
so much but I admire it I do I'm still

2508
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:50,439
fortunate to to to be in it you know I'm

2509
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:51,679
GNA I have at least one more year you

2510
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:54,279
know

2511
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:57,399
um before I really got a look and see if

2512
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:59,000
this is working or not yeah well

2513
01:43:57,399 --> 01:44:01,519
hopefully hopefully people will get

2514
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,599
together and realize their the the power

2515
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:05,840
in collectivism because there's true

2516
01:44:03,599 --> 01:44:08,520
power in that and I think there are

2517
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,639
reasons why people don't know that yeah

2518
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:12,840
the need to capture added value to your

2519
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:14,480
product and absolutely um you know some

2520
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:17,279
of the trade organizations are working

2521
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:20,319
on consumer direct sales for small

2522
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:24,118
farms um there's a thing called the ship

2523
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:26,238
Act at the national level which um I

2524
01:44:24,118 --> 01:44:28,920
mean it hasn't been voted on yet but it

2525
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:31,079
would be a writer on some other Bill to

2526
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,760
say like when that when legaliza Federal

2527
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:37,800
legalization does happen we're giving

2528
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:41,320
small farms under such and such a size

2529
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:44,800
um path to re retail sales themselves as

2530
01:44:41,319 --> 01:44:48,479
opposed to um having to go through

2531
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,920
dispensaries and stuff yeah and that's

2532
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:52,759
that's what the small farm needs to

2533
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,920
survive is is is is farmers markets you

2534
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:57,239
know let let that small Farm sell direct

2535
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:59,719
to their consumer people want that

2536
01:44:57,238 --> 01:45:01,158
anyways but then they can capture they

2537
01:44:59,719 --> 01:45:03,158
cut out the middleman and capture the

2538
01:45:01,158 --> 01:45:05,399
added value of making retail

2539
01:45:03,158 --> 01:45:08,879
sales and I mean the wine industry

2540
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:10,920
already does this with their wine clubs

2541
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,279
and their tasting rooms yeah they you

2542
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:15,158
know you can come to the vineyard come

2543
01:45:12,279 --> 01:45:17,759
to the winery taste taste what there is

2544
01:45:15,158 --> 01:45:21,039
to taste buy a bottle or two or or or

2545
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:22,679
whatever hang out um

2546
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:24,479
every every Farm's not going to be set

2547
01:45:22,679 --> 01:45:26,079
up to do that but collectively we could

2548
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:29,359
definitely set something up like that

2549
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:32,319
and join our our wine club let let us

2550

01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:39,399
a month or or or whatever it ends up

2553
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:42,119
being I don't know but um they already

2554
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:44,319
have SE like it yeah let I mean those

2555
01:45:42,118 --> 01:45:47,319
wineries when you go byy to Wine Country

2556
01:45:44,319 --> 01:45:49,439
and buy wine there like you're paying

2557
01:45:47,319 --> 01:45:50,960
you're paying an inflated price you're

2558
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:53,598
not getting it cheaper because you're at

2559
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,118
the source you're paying more for it yes

2560
01:45:53,599 --> 01:45:56,719
right I don't even want I don't even

2561
01:45:55,118 --> 01:45:59,439
want to charge more I just want to

2562
01:45:56,719 --> 01:46:02,198
charge retail a fair retail price just

2563
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:04,598
so I can make a living you know and show

2564
01:46:02,198 --> 01:46:06,559
people like yes like this weed is better

2565
01:46:04,599 --> 01:46:09,639
than what you're finding in the store

2566
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:11,840
and you know what once once enough Farms

2567
01:46:09,639 --> 01:46:13,520
are able to do that and like actually

2568
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:16,199
have a client

2569
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:18,320
base yes hopefully they can sell direct

2570
01:46:16,198 --> 01:46:19,960
but to the people that can't get shipped

2571
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:21,559
weed or the people that can't show up to

2572
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:25,039
the farmers Market they're going to look

2573
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:27,320
for it in a store yeah and so that'll

2574
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:29,198
drive sales to these dispensaries that

2575
01:46:27,319 --> 01:46:32,039
are fighting us tooth and nail to not

2576
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:37,399
allow us to sell consumer

2577
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:38,519
direct so yeah right it's so no dude I

2578
01:46:37,399 --> 01:46:41,000
think I think it's one of the most

2579
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:43,440
important things uh to talk about is is

2580
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,679
the power collectivism and being able to

2581
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:48,799
to push back against the corporate [ __ ]

2582
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:50,880
going on I I saw this with 64 like I was

2583
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:53,400
like oh the probably going to make it

2584
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,719
more illegal for us to grow more illegal

2585
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:57,439
for corporations to sell weed which in

2586
01:46:55,719 --> 01:46:59,079
turn makes it more legal for them to

2587
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:00,719
grow weed with the right licenses more

2588
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:03,639
expensive for us and then they'll break

2589
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:06,039
us MoneyWise gotcha well I mean I mean

2590
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:08,440
the old the old cow growers association

2591
01:47:06,039 --> 01:47:11,800
hezeki Allen like he had to fight tooth

2592
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:14,079
and nail just to not set California up

2593
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:15,920
as like a six licensed State like some

2594
01:47:14,079 --> 01:47:17,679
of these other east coast states where

2595
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:20,639
yeah you know there's just six licenses

2596
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:24,800
and that's it to let to let these small

2597
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:26,880
farms like uh one one of his buddies uh

2598
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,079
uh Casey O'Neal said a long time ago if

2599
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,599
you don't have a seat at the table

2600
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:33,319
you're on the menu yep and that's and

2601
01:47:30,599 --> 01:47:35,119
that's exactly what it is so that's why

2602
01:47:33,319 --> 01:47:37,479
you know getting Behind These trade

2603
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:40,279
organizations that that are made up of

2604
01:47:37,479 --> 01:47:42,079
small farms and then there's one broad

2605
01:47:40,279 --> 01:47:44,439
Trade Organization made up of these

2606
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:46,719
small farm trade organizations that

2607
01:47:44,439 --> 01:47:49,638
lobbies at the state level to to to push

2608
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:51,158
back and to to these these huge money

2609
01:47:49,639 --> 01:47:53,359
corporate interests that can pay

2610
01:47:51,158 --> 01:47:56,399
lobbyists and lawyers to to to write

2611
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:58,519
regulations for for the state to say no

2612
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:01,158
you got a whole region up here that

2613
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:02,840
needs something else yeah and there

2614
01:48:01,158 --> 01:48:04,598
there are voice and and that's why you

2615
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,480
got to be you got to be a little

2616
01:48:04,599 --> 01:48:08,679
politically active in cannabis and that

2617
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:11,238
goes back to the 215 days too yeah it

2618
01:48:08,679 --> 01:48:13,880
does you had to educate City councils

2619
01:48:11,238 --> 01:48:15,638
you had to you had to you had to be you

2620
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:19,279
had to be an activist if you're going to

2621
01:48:15,639 --> 01:48:21,079
be in cannabis because you had to like

2622
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:22,399
you had to you were pushing through new

2623
01:48:21,079 --> 01:48:25,479
like Virgin

2624
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:27,719
Territory and you weren't just going to

2625
01:48:25,479 --> 01:48:29,279
set up a shop and just do business you

2626
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:30,920
know because there's going to be forces

2627
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:34,559
coming back at you so you got to be

2628
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:36,399
active and pushing against them yeah so

2629
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,400
yeah I mean like that old term all

2630
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:40,359
politics is local like realistically a

2631
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:42,638
lot of people pay attention to the the

2632
01:48:40,359 --> 01:48:43,799
you know nation's news every night but

2633
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:45,920
pay attention to what's going on

2634
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:48,039
immediately around you and get it

2635
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:50,199
matters so much more who's on your city

2636
01:48:48,039 --> 01:48:52,439
council or your Board of Supervisors or

2637
01:48:50,198 --> 01:48:54,519
your Planning Commission like especially

2638
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:57,118
if you're in business in any business in

2639
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:59,040
that area that's going to play a much a

2640
01:48:57,118 --> 01:49:00,158
much bigger role in the success of your

2641
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:02,479
business because they might just

2642
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:03,759
regulate you out of business yeah that's

2643
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:05,638
for real you know because somebody's

2644
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,800
gonna be in their ear wanting one thing

2645
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:10,400
and if you're not in their ear chirping

2646
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:12,239
about the other thing you're you're yeah

2647
01:49:10,399 --> 01:49:14,238
you're gonna get put out of business

2648
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:16,479
you're you know you're gonna you're

2649
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:18,118
going to let Walmart move in unless you

2650
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:21,839
say something about it and they're and

2651
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:23,880
you're done you know

2652
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:26,039
Walmart's definitely in your your

2653
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:27,840
supervisor's ear you better you better

2654
01:49:26,039 --> 01:49:30,800
be in the other ear talking about n this

2655
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:32,599
is [ __ ] they can afford the lobbyist

2656
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:35,239
we just have to be as smart and as

2657
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:37,360
active more active and smarter more

2658
01:49:35,238 --> 01:49:38,959
active and just unite finally we've

2659
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:40,519
always been independent and when the

2660
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:42,719
price was high it was easy to be

2661
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,880
independent yeah you know and now it's

2662
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,039
just like no like you gotta you gotta be

2663
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,840
if you want to do this you got to be

2664
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:50,840
thinking 10 years ahead what you want it

2665
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,599
to look like and start now yeah because

2666
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:54,560
somebody else already has that vision

2667
01:49:52,599 --> 01:49:56,760
and that's what they do for a living is

2668
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:58,679
manipulate things for their benefit you

2669
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:01,480
