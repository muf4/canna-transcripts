00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,959
uh what do you guys think is it better

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
worse let's get it started and ask them

46
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,959
before we

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,878
because i can turn it up and i can turn

48
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,560
it down sometimes

49
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,719
i did not get a haircut nor did i shave

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,080
full rough neck this week

51
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,719
yeah

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,120
it is a big vibrator it's a big vibrator

53
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,120
it does look very very very phallic i

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
would say but i mean it's a microphone

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319
so that's just kind of how they're

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,959
shaped it just gotta fit in my mouth

57
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,560
buddy all right so it looks like

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,878
everybody's saying it's good so we'll go

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,640
with it and see how that is good

60
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,039
all right um

61
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,238
today's topic you wanna you wanna say

62
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,919
what it is

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,080
yeah i mean we're gonna we're gonna

64
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,439
bounce around a little bit like uh

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,239
always but

66
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,598
uh

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,120
one of the things that we might start

68
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,199
with is just sort of like we keep

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,200
getting questions on

70
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,359
you know we talk a lot about

71
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,679
on various shows and it's certainly a

72
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,319
big thing on instagram and other places

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,400
of media of like

74
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,958
how many different directions uh the

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,439
scene is going that we don't like yeah

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,680
right and you know we've so we've spent

77
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,680
a bunch of time talking about like

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,360
various effects and all that and then

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
people keep suggesting well what if we

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
talked about things that we could do or

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,519
you know on that level or something

82
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,759
destructive something constructive

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,280
perhaps or something that like even

84
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,919
someone who's not very connected or

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
whatever on any level could accomplish

86
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,158
right and so that like that resonated

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
with me pretty good because

88
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,560
it is uh it is better to talk about

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
constructive things

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
you know than it is to i mean it's

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,239
important to like discuss the problems

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,319
so people know what's going on

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,719
right but then it's like it can it can

94
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,560
definitely seem insurmountable

95
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,239
it does and right now is a really easy

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,158
time for it to filter insurmountable and

97
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,158
there's so many different

98
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,000
problems coming at cannabis in general

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,120
from so many different directions as we

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,639
see it

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
yeah and so you know i kind of do this

102
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,759
thing fairly often on the discord where

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,438
i'll throw i'll throw out some questions

104
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,798
for everybody to see what they want to

105
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,479
hear talked about

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,319
um and you know sometimes people come up

107
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,798
with some pretty good some pretty good

108
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,798
angles on things on top of that so we

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,840
might delve into that too but

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,519
um

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,878
i don't know you know yeah how to change

112
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,760
things where we're at

113
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:16,639
right

114
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,478
so

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
i think maybe

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,839
what what's really happening is that

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,079
anytime

118
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,918
you know uh people really aren't adapted

119
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,159
to fast change

120
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,478
yeah right so there's been a lot of

121
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,639
changes happening really fast

122
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,680
and i think it makes people's heads to

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,759
some degree

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,639
um and it's happening fast enough that

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,840
like

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,439
you know i don't know if you think this

127
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,519
way matt but it's almost like every year

128
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,160
or two is like a different scene

129
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,879
yeah especially now where that like that

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,479
maybe took like five or ten years

131
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,800
for like things to like seem

132
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,120
dramatically different on any level and

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,280
so great big strain changes and stuff

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,519
like that yeah like strain you know

135
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,959
strains that got popular had a longer

136
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:04,240
had a longer like run time of popularity

137
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,239
you know um the laws changed slower um

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,600
you know pricing and just you know

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,879
there's a lot of things that just seemed

140
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,439
a little bit more stable and now

141
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,120
everything's kind of rapid fire yeah

142
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,519
right there's rapid fire change and that

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
makes people uncomfortable right yeah

144
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,240
people are people are talking about

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
there's a bunch of stuff going on like

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,439
right now on the internet of like

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,439
you know the community's trying to

148
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,360
figure out like well who can you partner

149
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,478
with all these changes going on what is

150
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,319
ethical

151
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,159
yeah what's happening for the for

152
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,439
something that's been black market and

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,800
illicit and clandestine for so long it's

154
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,519
a different time

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,280
kind of so what is okay and things that

156
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,758
weren't okay before that would get you

157
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,359
blacklisted may not be the same today

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,038
yeah so i mean and some of that is just

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
some of that is just changing culture i

160
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,038
mean you know i don't want to be like

161
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
old man yells at cloud you know or

162
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,719
whatever

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,918
because changes change but sometimes

164
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
uh

165
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,879
you know there's different forces now

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,639
than there used to be right um you know

167
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,439
and maybe the best way to put it in a

168
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,680
nutshell is that like before

169
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,918
all the forces against us were pretty

170
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,800
much in prohibition

171
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,038
yeah to a large degree right yeah and i

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,240
i've even been giving this some some

173
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,759
thought because there's people that are

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
getting roasted now for some of the

175
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
people they're partnering with and stuff

176
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,198
like that and they're fighting back and

177
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
i even think to some degree like maybe

178
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,079
the way

179
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,159
that people fight back against those

180
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,000
people like matt even for somebody like

181
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
you who like it used to be very

182
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,680
effective to call somebody out in the

183
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,038
community yeah

184
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
you know i don't know if that's even the

185
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,120
most effective path anymore right yeah i

186
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,800
i don't think it is

187
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,079
and it's hard sometimes for people who

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
have a

189
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,839
past of doing that constantly you know

190
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,160
you know one way to handle certain

191
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,439
situations but i think now it really is

192
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,439
a lot of beating your head against a

193
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,959
wall yeah i mean people are throwing out

194
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,879
the names and stuff like that that's

195
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,159
going on and you know what it's really

196
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,839
exposing is that you know there's uh

197
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,800
there's never been like this uber

198
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,959
ethical time in wheat yeah weeds always

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,478
been full of shady characters you know

200
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,198
for a long time it was criminal in

201
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,079
various regards us you know and so some

202
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,840
people

203
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,279
you know um some people were in it just

204
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,719
because they felt like that was silly

205
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,000
and they loved weed

206
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,000
yeah and you know some people aren't

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,680
cause they're criminals yeah too you

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,439
know and that was just another criminal

209
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,879
[ __ ] to do or whatever and some people

210
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,240
are in it for rep and money and some

211
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,079
people are in it for the plan everyone

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
wants to say they're in it for the plan

213
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,680
yeah i mean that's a good thing to say

214
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,879
it's a good talking point but it isn't

215
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,038
necessarily true for everyone but what

216
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,800
people are noticing is by people's

217
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,879
associations now

218
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,079
right now you're starting to realize

219
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,839
well like where do those ethics lie

220
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,159
right and so there's and you know and

221
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,079
it's it's gone back i mean matt matt

222
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,319
remembers even like when colorado first

223
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,839
went legal there was people in colorado

224
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,000
that should remain nameless that got

225
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,000
into battles with buddies of ours

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,079
um about like well you know

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
go legal that's the option and if you

228
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,918
don't then you're unfair competition and

229
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
it's not even snitching or ratting to

230
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,120
like get you gone

231
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,879
yeah because you're just untaxed you're

232
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,280
not paying the same dues i am like

233
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,439
you're refusing to take the path

234
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,638
and so that was like a massive split in

235
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,399
the community

236
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,478
that was a that was a very big turning

237
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,399
point in the community when when it

238
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,800
became possible to

239
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,519
snitch people out to med boards and not

240
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,319
necessarily the police and at what point

241
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,519
is

242
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,919
yeah or whatever

243
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,000
you know or doxing or their doctors yeah

244
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,839
it's just just a variety of pressure

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
tactics to get people off their back

246
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,038
because a lot of times

247
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,200
you know really what it boils down to is

248
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,799
there's people that are making all kinds

249
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,120
of choices about their own personal

250
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,598
future and their friends right

251
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,120
um and in some cases like when they get

252
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,158
exposed they don't want to be exposed

253
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,839
because

254
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,000
um they feel like that might hurt their

255
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
customer base sure

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
yeah i heard seed cells potentially

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,799
which could hurt their ability to

258
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,320
partner with some of these people

259
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,559
because they have to be useful to these

260
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
bigger powers yeah and stuff like that

261
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,079
right and so

262
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,838
um so there's an aspect now where it's

263
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,278
like there's a lot of

264
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
there's a lot of secret snitching

265
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,838
there's a lot of doxing there's a lot of

266
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,120
like through proxies or whatever and and

267
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,959
how so

268
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
kind of what's happened is now is like

269
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,119
the community has sort of lost the

270
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
ability to police itself right

271
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,320
i can't even believe that word but it's

272
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,959
like now people are like you know it's

273
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,839
acceptable to work with police

274
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,799
yeah

275
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,720
it is

276
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,479
you know like and be like oh this you

277
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,519
know and uh

278
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
yeah

279
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,639
so

280
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,879
i mean that that's about as 180 degrees

281
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,000
c change as you can possibly imagine

282
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,759
yeah right and so we're again we're

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,120
discussing issues now but really what it

284
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,000
boils down to

285
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,879
is

286
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,919
so

287
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,159
i look at it and i i talk about it uh in

288
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,399
my head like i think about this a lot

289
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,319
right where yeah my whole life they've

290
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,080
been telling me for in regards to

291
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
cannabis that it's it's bad for you to

292
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
have it you can't have it you can't have

293
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,360
it you can't have it you can't have it

294
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,680
right yeah and we've all been fighting

295
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,320
in this in this community like you know

296
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,239
the overgrown overgrow was named

297
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,640
right yeah for people that don't know

298
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,480
the first real weed forum overgrow was

299
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,039
named because the concept was overgrow

300
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
the government yes like if too many

301
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,958
people start growing and so many people

302
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,199
start disobeying and people refuse to

303
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,239
respect the law then eventually they'll

304
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,320
have to

305
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,159
change the law so that people keep

306
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,079
respect for other laws

307
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,559
yeah so that was like the whole that was

308
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,439
like the whole theory right was like was

309
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,119
uh

310
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,839
um

311
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,039
you know was overgrown yeah okay and so

312
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,040
now we have that comes

313
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,919
it's old school yeah it was that concept

314
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,079
it was him and bernard mello yellow the

315
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,078
whole thing his big thing was to to get

316
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,399
a bunch of hemp plants give them out for

317
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,679
free hemp clones and say overgrow the

318
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
government here's how we're going to do

319
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,120
it i'm giving away all the hemp plants

320
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,039
before uh before 1996 when california

321
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,039
actually passed proposition 215 which

322
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,399
was the first medical in the country and

323
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,120
it was the first place to take it from

324
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,278
totally illegal to like a path towards

325
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,799
like like you can call it a gray area do

326
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,879
you remember when they used to push for

327
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,359
like to get like hundreds of thousands

328
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,679
of hippies to move to wyoming yeah

329
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
because it was so lightly populated we

330
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,879
could probably affect the vote and

331
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,839
people were trying to figure out well

332
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,439
what state can we actually get some

333
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,360
movement yeah right what state can we

334
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
actually get something and now we've

335
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,000
overgrown to the point where people are

336
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,399
looking around at prices uh and how to

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,320
survive and all the various things that

338
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,440
are happening and then like maybe man

339
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,000
maybe we overgrew a bit too much yeah

340
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,160
and so that aspect that price dive that

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,839
worry that we talk about that's

342
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,199
caused a lot of people to look around

343
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,160
and and

344
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,278
and choices are being made yeah

345
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,120
right

346
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,639
yeah people are mentioning certain

347
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,200
choices right now i mean when we're

348
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,240
talking about choices um you can go back

349
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,600
to even

350
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,200
the the roll-up of of how it worked

351
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,879
and how the community reacted when we

352
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,560
saw things like icy mag and heaven

353
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,879
stairway get taken down he was

354
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,879
mentioning shebang you know that was one

355
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,120
of the people that got taken down for

356
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,679
um i believe running icy mag and heaven

357
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,759
stairway somewhere after that when that

358
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,719
happened and was that o5

359
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,159
somewhere

360
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
icy mac was later they have the stairway

361
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,360
is right about oh five i haven't i i

362
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,279
mean heaven stairway that got like

363
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,959
cannabis world and overgrowth taken down

364
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,399
yeah but it's all part of the same bus

365
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,000
it's all part of the same thing when

366
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,600
that happened i got scared enough of the

367
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,519
internet i honestly didn't really start

368
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
poking around again until

369
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,440
social media really came back on in the

370
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,839
mid teens yeah

371
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,160
i was scared off it for a while you know

372
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,880
make sense i got scared off i see mag

373
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,958
once the cops seized the servers i and

374
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,278
usually um yeah shabang is actually

375
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,159
there there's paperwork right now and

376
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,799
he's

377
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,360
he's in trial so yeah he he did get

378
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,958
busted unfortunately um that he got

379
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,879
busted with the server

380
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,799
and and top cops don't tend to give

381
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,399
servers back when they take them either

382
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,519
so a lot of people need to keep that in

383
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,958
mind

384
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,320
but you know so there's an aspect of uh

385
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,638
you know people are asking well what can

386
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,000
we do to change things positively

387
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,159
yeah right

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,078
um and you know there's an aspect where

389
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,600
they're i'm i'm not big on mentioning

390
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,359
names on the show or whatever there's a

391
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
bunch of comments going on but obviously

392
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,399
like there's a lot of stuff going on

393
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,480
recently on ig and and you know people

394
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,679
are talking about like associations that

395
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
people are doing

396
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,919
yeah right well you know you can you can

397
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,720
vote with your wallet

398
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,198
yeah

399
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,959
they're gonna try to hide their work and

400
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,958
off in different brands and different

401
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,479
this and different that you can figure

402
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,638
out who they are and you cannot spend

403
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,639
your money on them yeah right they

404
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,639
essentially need an enormous amount of

405
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,639
consumer money to stay afloat

406
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,480
always they're all doing this because

407
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,320
they think this is the best money play

408
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,879
for themselves

409
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
so the way to hurt them is to is to deny

410
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,838
that money play

411
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,439
yeah right is to you know you can so you

412
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,880
know maybe maybe i'll continue my

413
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
thought or whatever so my whole life

414
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,799
they can't have it you can't have it you

415
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,159
can't have it right and now we're at

416
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,519
this point where they're like man this

417
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,799
thing's kind of cool

418
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,519
i mean we'll take it from here yeah

419
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,599
so to me the fight hasn't changed really

420
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,720
the fight has just shifted we used to

421
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,959
fight for

422
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,759
access and acceptance

423
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,439
yeah right that was the big fight access

424
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,879
acceptance and the ability to do that

425
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,000
without getting in trouble just because

426
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:36,320
it's a plan it's [ __ ] stupid yeah so

427
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,759
now we're kind of getting there

428
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,440
yeah we've made we've made way faster

429
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,278
expansion on access and and safety and

430
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,800
the ability to use it and i think with

431
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,838
within a number of years a lot of these

432
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,198
like piss testing for jobs will go away

433
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,839
i think there was something announced

434
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,919
today about that right in the news

435
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,519
i'm not sure actually but

436
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,759
it's gonna go away soon because so many

437
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,600
states are led making it legal

438
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,039
um it's just gonna you know and then

439
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,360
wide varieties of people are gonna be

440
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,879
able to start using it without penalty

441
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,120
yeah it has something to do with jobs

442
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,198
not being able to discriminate in legal

443
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,799
states where there's medical cannabis

444
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,399
and yeah they're not allowed to

445
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,198
discriminate against legal cannabis if i

446
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,440
remember correctly so so here's the gig

447
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,679
when it as it shifts from like safety

448
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,079
and freedom and access

449
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,638
right and the right to do so now it's

450
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,599
going to shift to like who controls it

451
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,600
who sells it to you like who

452
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
um you know like

453
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,519
that really that who controls it

454
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,278
that's the fight and it probably will be

455
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,039
a fight that we're battling but what

456
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,039
people have to remember it's dark days

457
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,198
right now and

458
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,799
it's like a lot of people that are like

459
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,240
deeply in the cannabis industry are

460
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,078
hurting pretty bad

461
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,159
yeah which is why i think it's causing

462
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,078
some of these desperate moves

463
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,679
yes right is that when it comes down to

464
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,278
it there's people that like they want to

465
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,479
survive they want to make money and if

466
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,439
they have to deal with the devil they

467
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
will

468
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,880
right

469
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
but i would like to throw out there that

470
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,439
um

471
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
you know when it comes down to it that

472
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
we are winning

473
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,799
right it's just that the fight has

474
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,199
shifted

475
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,278
you know like we were fighting huh who's

476
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,679
we that's winning well i mean in the

477
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:18,559
sense that like you know imagine 15

478
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:21,838
years ago if you thought that like 38 or

479
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,518
40 states in in in america would allow

480
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,920
recreational or

481
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,959
medical campuses

482
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:32,240
right like there's more access for more

483
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,159
people now than ever before

484
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,560
right so we're not happy with the

485
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,198
direction the scene is going but that's

486
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,958
because our previous goal we were all

487
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,639
pretty united on

488
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,039
we want this thing to be available and

489
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,560
accessible and not get people in trouble

490
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,599
and we want to be able to smoke and

491
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,679
share weed

492
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,680
yeah and now it's gone into like this

493
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,439
economic thing where

494
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,719
people are like when you think about i

495
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,079
don't want to say corporations because

496
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,278
that's just like a group of people or

497
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,479
whatever but when you think about big

498
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,120
business say

499
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,639
yeah they're going to want to control it

500
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,839
they're going to want to patent it

501
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,679
they're going to want to make it look at

502
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,519
all the recreational stuff going on it's

503
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,240
not exactly legal

504
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,000
it's more like highly regulated tightly

505
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,000
taxed and controlled

506
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,279
yes you know

507
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,439
nothing

508
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,279
decriminalized about it yeah i mean if

509
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959

tomato seeds yeah you can

516
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,079
yeah we could all we could all trade and

517
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,678
share and post pictures of our hybrids

518
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,439
and our this and our that and everything

519
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,480
else and it would be free no one would

520
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,720
give a [ __ ]

521
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,640
um that's legal

522
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,960
what we have is like so what we have

523
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,960
going on right now is that um you know

524
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,480
if you have a six plant limit for in

525
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
your state

526
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,679
you basically can't breed

527
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,679
yeah you can't keep mom stock you can't

528
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,600
have a normal amount of plants that a

529
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,080
per even a hobbyist

530
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,240
and this experiment to me this is where

531
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,918
the the term legal legalization was

532
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,200
bastardized and a lot of uneducated even

533
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,440
when i was 15 even when i was 15 i knew

534
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,120
that once corporations got their hands

535
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,798
dug in deep enough to be able to take

536
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,319
over immediately that's when they're

537
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,839
gonna flip the bill even as a 15 year

538
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,839
old kid i realize that's how the world

539
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,000
works that's how corporations work

540
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,079
that's what happened but i did not

541
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,960
expect them to push it under the guise

542
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,720
of legalization because even today any

543
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,640
any average citizen who doesn't grow but

544
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,880
smokes and if you ask them if wheat is

545
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,759
legal they're going to tell you yes 99

546
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,520
of the time

547
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,679
yes and they don't even know what's

548
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,279
happening to the real growers side of

549
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,400
the aspect that there's nothing legal

550
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,279
about

551
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,440
being

552
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,960
they're making it legal in the sense to

553
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,759
possess or whatever but you still have

554
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,000
to go to approve stores

555
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,279
and buy it from approved vendors

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,599
and

557
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,798
and as we both know that invites

558
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,879
corruption and all these different

559
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,160
levels sure you know and so strangely

560
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,840
and this might be

561
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,519
like from a capitalist perspective this

562
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:11,359
might be one of the first cases that i

563
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,079
know of of this where it's like uh

564
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,000
the

565
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,159
legalization of something led to a

566
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,038
massive drop in quality and a massive

567
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,038
increase in price

568
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,679
hmm

569
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,200
yeah

570
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,798
i don't know about the massive increase

571
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,400
in price with the drop in quality that's

572
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,918
a hard one

573
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
you know well i mean there's think about

574
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,919
how many people are buying like 70 and

575
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,160
80 eighths

576
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,480
yeah

577
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,720
right yeah and think about how expensive

578
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,720
all that stuff is now yeah yeah and i

579
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,400
mean there's there's plenty of cheap too

580
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,679
but it's like the taxes i mean i saw

581
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,600
that thing where

582
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,840
you know they broke down like how much

583
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,879
an eighth is and like the farmer gets

584
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,759
three bucks and the tax man gets 21

585
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,799
bucks

586
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,720
and the dis and the and the dyspo gets

587
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,160
20 bucks and then the

588
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,400
[ __ ]

589
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,200
you know dispensary gets 40 bucks and

590
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,120
you end up paying 80 bucks yeah

591
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,960
you know it's it's that that is

592
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,399
preposterous there's like three layers

593
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,720
there there's the government there's the

594
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,400
distribution and there's the store

595
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,279
and they're all

596
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,798
you know pillaging because they can

597
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,759
i paid attention when i was a kid i

598
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,679
watched that movie robin hood

599
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,038
and i remember there was a sheriff of

600
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,120
nottingham

601
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,440
and i remember they would

602
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,959
bug people for money and i kept that

603
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,960
with me growing up and i was like wow

604
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,640
this tax thing is a scam isn't it like

605
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,720
to at some level

606
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,360
at some level the way it works now this

607
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
is

608
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,558
we've all been conditioned to think that

609
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,640
this is what we need to do and i agree

610
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,240
to have society people need to pitch in

611
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,400
but i mean

612
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,919
what i think has happened is like

613
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,840
you know it's it's one of those things

614
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,759
where any time like any kind of vice

615
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,279
becomes more acceptable

616
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,240
they want to give money to cops in

617
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,319
schools

618
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,400
yes obviously like they're just like

619
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,519
well you know here's funding for various

620
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
groups

621
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,519
right and so we're going to tax the [ __ ]

622
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,158
out of this vice or whatever it might be

623
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,240
right so he's the other voting half and

624
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,919
you know they they made taxes based

625
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,679
probably on like a much higher pound

626
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,799
price than people are getting

627
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,280
yeah

628
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,200
in that regard so

629
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,960
you know so it's not really so that's

630
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,960
really what's happened is like in the

631
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,720
215 era

632
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,159
anybody could grow whatever they wanted

633
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
and if they had a medical card and they

634
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,760
grew good enough weed they could walk

635
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,639
into a medical dispensary and they could

636
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,519
make a deal yeah and that allowed a wide

637
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,320
variety of things to proliferate

638
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,679
i mean one of the one of the aspects of

639
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,399
the person that's getting [ __ ] talked

640
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,240
about this week um is that not only are

641
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,559
people upset at like the the

642
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,440
associations that he's making right

643
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,200
um but he but it you know a lot of the

644
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
genetics that people you know he sold

645
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
his genetics for a high dollar and they

646
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,798
were and there was a nurse reaction and

647
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,960
there was a lot of disease and viroid

648
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,679
involved a lot of vibrate which we will

649
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,079
be doing a show september 8th about the

650
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,919
hop laden viroid and everything you'd

651
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,240
ever want to know inside out we're going

652
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,919
to try to cover yeah and because it's

653
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,159
it's uh it's the new

654
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,520
you know with a all it takes is poor

655
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,120
practices

656
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,079
at a facility

657
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,719
especially at a nursery uh and not and a

658
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,918
lack of care and spending on testing and

659
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,839
you can nuke uh you can spend so many

660
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,679
gardens and get infected

661
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,319
yeah we've had friends who have lost

662
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,960
whole collections time and time again

663
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,639
because of this virus because it's not

664
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,480
really your vibrate because it's not

665
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,919
easy to clean

666
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,079
and that's you know that's a that's a

667
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,640
that's a that's a product to be honest

668
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,038
of legalization but without proper

669
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,080
regulation yes

670
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,640
you know

671
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:47,359
um you know i mean on on a certain level

672
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,038
it's like uh you know using using razor

673
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,959
blades on multiple plants is sort of

674
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,679
like using tattoo needles on multiple

675
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,600
customers or junkies share needles it's

676
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,600
the same whatever whatever it's the same

677
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,439
gig it's like unless it's sterilized in

678
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,599
between or you use a fresh one for the

679
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
next like it's it's got to be kind of

680
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,240
that kind of of

681
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,400
of environment now yeah because it's

682
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,440
written it you know and so

683
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,960
there's important another reason

684
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,519
to not forget to buy seeds we should not

685
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,120
let the seed industry die

686
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,400
so yeah i mean that's that's another

687
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,158
thing is that

688
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,320
maybe one i don't know my comments have

689
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,919
totally frozen i haven't yeah mine i

690
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,918
haven't seen any new comments in a bit

691
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,679
so if people are typing stuff in

692
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,840
it's like for the last five minutes it's

693
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,200
just not done jack so i apologize if i'm

694
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,000

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,360
um

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,240
but

697
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,959
you know there's it used to be that

698
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,919
uh the 215 era and sort of the grain

699

sized growers independent breeders

703
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,879
uh you know various types uh you know

704
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,679
pretty low bar to entry

705
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,278
yeah

706
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,880
you know and now that that's all getting

707
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,038
now that's all getting like you know

708
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,360
legalized or whatever else it's barring

709

to turn it off and on but it didn't

712
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,359

715
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,798
we could stop it and uh i can edit this

716
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,119
