1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,318
What up, fam? It's me, Chuck Dog. I

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,879
gotta give everybody a little warning.

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:12,160
YouTube don't like us much. So, I just

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,160
wanted to take a second to say warning.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,800
This video is probably like rated R.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,439
Don't watch it if you're a kid.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Everything in this video is a prop and

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,679
it's all for educational purposes only.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,480
So, don't do what I do. Stay in school

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,719
and don't be a fool. But I just had to

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,039
get that out of the way real quick. All

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,679
right, Chuck Dog

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:43,039
here. After a long day in the garden and

14
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,878
outside in the hot sun weed eating,

15
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,679
there's only going to be one thing I

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:52,079
turn to in the refrigerator, and that's

17
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:55,359
a Ke stream classic cannabis infused

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,759
soda. These things come in seven, eight

19
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,238
different flavors. They're packed with

20
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,039
100 milligrams of THC that's going to

21
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,518
send you to the next

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,719
stratosphere. So, next time you get hot

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,400
and you want to keep it

24
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,400
extreme, reach for a keef

25
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:23,438
extreme. So, here's the deal, guys. We

26
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,798
just cracked open a Kef Extreme

27
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,359
uh Purple Passion. Okay, that little

28
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,960
skit you saw there, that's how we would

29
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:35,680
run a sponsorship ad if we had some. So,

30
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,519
you know, Keith or uh somebody else holl

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,520
at your boy, you know, can I shout out?

32
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,719
I could really use some Bloom. That

33
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,560
stuff's expensive. But here's the deal.

34
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,560
It's about an hour or so before I'm

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,560
going to film. I just got uh Keith

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,719
Extreme cracked open. Now, I'm not

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,719
sponsored by these people. I looked into

38
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,078
them a little bit. Uh, it looks like the

39
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,959
guy started this back in uh 2010 or

40
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,639
something like that. So, I don't really

41
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,199
know much about the guy or the company.

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,000
So, you know, as always, y'all do your

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,759
research. Uh, unlike me, cuz you know,

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,759
if these people are good or bad, I'm not

45
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,039
really sure the companies. You know, it

46
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,280
is what it is. But, we're going to have

47
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,199
some fun. I'm going to chug this Kef

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
Extreme right here, boy. And I'm going

49
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,878
to see what happens. You know, I tried

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
one out yesterday. The blue raspberry

51
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,560
got me a little little lifted. You know,

52
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,839
I didn't I didn't chug it though. But we

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
going to sit here. We going we going to

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,598
get this one down. We going to chill for

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,039
a second. And uh you know, I need to go

56
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,560
get something to eat before we start the

57
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,639
show. But we going to try to see if we

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,920
can bring a Ke extreme. We going to keep

59
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,359
it extreme. And we're going to do the

60
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,639
show and see if we can make it through.

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
So uh

62
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,160
cheers.

63
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:54,238
Now it's pretty good, bro. Tastes like

64
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,959
kind of like a watered down grape grape

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,959
soda, you

66
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,359
know. Can't taste much of the THC in

67
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:11,120
there. I could more in the raspberry one

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,080
yesterday, but it was uh lukewarm. You

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,878
know, you don't want to drink these

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,319
lukewarm. This is ice cold. I'm talking

71
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,919
colder than a witch's

72
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:22,560
titty. I'm excited for it, y'all. We

73
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,958
gonna rock out. Anyways, I'm not gonna

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,800
sit here. I'm not a chugger. I I've

75
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,199
never really, you know, a deep I'm not

76
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,879
much of a deep throer or a chugger. So,

77
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,318
especially when it's ice cold like this.

78
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,598
So, I'm going to finish this off. I'm

79
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,280
going run inside. I'm going to get some

80
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,359
stuff ready and then we're going to jump

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
right into the show. For y'all, it's

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,799
going to be instant for me. It's going

83
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,238
to take a second. So, anyways, I'm gonna

84
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,319
finish this up and catch y'all back here

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,120
in just a second. We got a good show

86
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:51,318
coming up. A like, a comment, subscribe

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,200
would uh be appreciated. Thanks.

88
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:58,079
Holy Holy crap,

89
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,079
bro. I'm just kidding,

90
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,438
guys. Hey, can y'all hear me? I'm live.

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,158
I'm live here, boys. I'm live, gals.

92
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,400
Anyways, what's going on? I'm Chuck. If

93
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:17,039
you don't know me by now, uh you should.

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,519
I'm somewhat of a big deal in Kentucky.

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm slowly blowing up in the cano world

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,000
thanks to Matt and crew. And I just

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
wanted to say I appreciate you. Thanks

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,879
for all the love, the support, the

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,840
messages, all the all y'all. Everybody,

100
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,000
gals, girls, men's, every one of y'all.

101
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,119
I got messages from the south, the dirty

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,439
south. Everybody writing me saying,

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,280
"Hey, Chuck Dog, I appreciate you, bro.

104
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm from the South. I'm from Tennessee.

105
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,159
I'm from Georgia. I'm from Florida. I'm

106
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,479
from these places. I'm down south, bro.

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,960
and I I relate to you and I I I rock

108
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,879
with you and I think you're a cool guy

109
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,758
and I appreciate y'all and I appreciate

110
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,600
the support. Uh you know y'all who I do

111
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,560
it for. I do it for everybody but I you

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,759
know I I got a special place for all my

113
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,240
homies down south. You know uh but it is

114
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,240
what it is. I wanted to also say we got

115
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,720
it wrong on the last episode y'all and I

116
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
apologize. The blue zushi that I got was

117
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,520
not blue zushi. I should have looked

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,759
more into the cross but I was lazy. I

119
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,319
just I got consumed by the blueberry

120
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,879
smell and I just assumed blue means

121
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,439
blueberry in the blue zushi. But it

122
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,199
apparently it was, you know, kush mints,

123
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,600
cross or whatever. I don't really know

124
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,000
and I don't particularly care a whole

125
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,759
lot, but that's part of going to the rec

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
stores, you guys. You get ripped off

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,680
sometimes. And that's a lesson learned.

128
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,720
You know, would I say I'm at was

129
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,360
extremely dissatisfied with what I got?

130
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
Not really. I'm used to hood packs. I'm

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,319
used to things not being named what

132
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,079
they're supposed to be. It is what it

133
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,038
is. I thought it was more interesting

134
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,439
that it it had a blueberry chirps

135
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,759
blueberry kind of flavor to it. Smell or

136
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,399
not flavor, but a smell similar to the

137
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,000
blueberry from Matt. And that's that's

138
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,000
really what I took away from that whole

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
little experience. But speaking of

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,720
dispensaries, we got a little show for

141
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,680
y'all today. I'm I'm keeping it extreme.

142
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,720
I'm jacked off jacked off. I'm jacked up

143
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,720
on Keef Extreme. If y'all don't know

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,199
what it is in the intro, I know what the

145
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,919
heck this guy's buying drinks or little

146
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,560
fizzy pop. Sod pops. What is it they say

147
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:26,000
out out uh you know in the middle of the

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,720
country up north? They sody pop. Uh we

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,079
say Coke in in Kentucky. Everything's

150
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,319
Coke. It don't matter if it's Mountain

151
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,879
Dew. I want a Coke. I want a Coke, but I

152
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,080
want the mount a Mountain Dew. Okay. But

153
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,079
the main thing is I'm jacked up on Kefir

154
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,359
Extreme. Like I said in the intro, I

155
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,680
don't know anything about these people.

156
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,680
I looked a little bit up about them. You

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
know, tell me in the comments if you

158
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,680
know something. I don't really know.

159
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,839
Educate me, you guys. I'm not an expert.

160
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,759
I'm here to learn with y'all. I'm here

161
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,839
to to teach a little bit, but I'm here

162
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,160
to learn. But we're jacked up on on

163
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,598
Keith. Bunch of different flavors. I

164
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
drank a grape one. Well, heck, we'll

165
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,439
crack this one open, too. We going to

166
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,160
get we going to get lit. You just I mean

167
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,879
once you pop the top the freaking fun

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,599
don't stop you guys gals. Let's pull

169
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,598
that tab back there right there. M root

170
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,280
beer. That's pretty good actually. I

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
like

172
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,799
that. I probably should have shook it up

173
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,280
a little bit. Just shook it a little

174
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,360
bit. Now, now back on topic here. We got

175
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,000
the Kef Extremes flowing through our

176
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,759
blood, right? Uh, you know, I should

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
probably do some kind of review on it. I

178
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
don't know. I'm not good at reviews, but

179
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,960
I will say last night I drank a

180
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,598
raspberry one. I sipped on it and I got

181
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,680
me a nice good buzz going. I'm a

182
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,399
hardcore stoner. I'm smoking all day

183
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,240
long and I felt like they did me pretty

184
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,758
good. You know, it's little felt a

185
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,199
little groggy this morning. I will say I

186
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,879
drank it later at night. So, I did feel

187
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,680
a little groggy this morning when I woke

188
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,360
up. I'm not a big sod pop guy. Would pro

189
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
probably prefer a juice. But these

190
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,038
things are pretty cool. Especially if

191
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,400
you're just having one or two a week or

192
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,639
something, you know, kind of hanging out

193
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,000
sipping on a little little Keef Extreme,

194
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,680
keeping it extreme, you know. Uh, as far

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,839
as like the flavor and stuff, they're

196
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,519
they're good. Uh, the price was decent

197
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,198
at the little dispensary I went to and

198
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,439
picked them up and they had a little

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,720
deal. It was like three for 20 or

200
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,199
something like that, which wasn't really

201
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,440
that bad considering uh you know, you

202
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,080
get your little little get you a little

203
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,279
buzz, little head change off of it. You

204
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,199
know, this ain't something I'd probably

205
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,838
drink all the time cuz I'm not a big

206
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,360
edible guys cuz edible guy cuz I'll be

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,000
honest, y'all know me in the Discord. I

208
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,759
go off on tangents when I go crazy. I I

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
push it to the extreme. I'm not trying

210
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,679
to get catch a little high. I'm trying

211
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,039
to go to the another dimension and go

212
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:52,079
through a, you know, freaking vortex, a

213
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,958
portal in time to revisit myself while

214
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,879
I'm stoned and kiss myself and lick all

215
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,239
like

216
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:01,759
lick lick myself, you know, [ __ ] like

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,080
that. But, you know, I try when I do

218
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,399
partake, uh, I do like these drinks. I

219
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,080
had a drink before out in Colorado that

220
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,159
I actually love. Sometimes they got a

221
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
little weird aftertaste with some of

222
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,879
these products like this, but the one I

223
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,799
had out there had a penic a lot of like

224
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,120
banana flavor, but it wasn't carbonated.

225
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,479
It was like a juice. Ooh, it hit right,

226
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,399
dude. I really like that. It's a little

227
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,399
bit before [ __ ] was more regulated, too.

228
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,759
So, it was I'll be honest, it was an

229
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,600
adventure. I went out there to the Rock

230
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,838
and Mineral Show out there in Boulder,

231
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,839
Colorado. Shout out Boulder. Shout out

232
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,959
Colorado. I appreciate y'all. It's a

233
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,200
Y'all have a beautiful state. Um, shout

234
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,838
out Kentucky as always. Shout out the

235
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,759
South. Shout out Cali. Shout out

236
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,760
Michigan as always. Michigan baby. But I

237
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,159
appreciate all the sport support from

238
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,080
y'all. Especially the Michigan people.

239
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,159
Y'all y'all are too sweet to me. You

240
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,720
send me the kindest messages and I

241
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,639
really do appreciate it. You know, it's

242
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,320
not going to be easy peasy all the time.

243
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,799
We got a It's not going to be a smooth

244
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,519
transition. You know, Matt in the show

245
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:06,000
has went through a lot of ups and downs

246
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,360
over the years. And you know, it's going

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,720
to be different, y'all. We're going to

248
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,320
do something different. I'm not here to

249
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,560
hijack a show. I'm here to show. I'm

250
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,959
here to entertain you guys. I'm here to

251
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,359
show off the plants. The whole plan was

252
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,759
originally for me just to really come in

253
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,839
and do some plant videos and stuff like

254
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,519
that occasionally, but the way things

255
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,600
have happened, I haven't been able to do

256
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,360
that because of all the YouTube strikes.

257
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,839
They don't like us. So, we got another

258
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
channel. I'm working hard. It ain't

259
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,600
going to be Wreck Weed Products all the

260
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,200
time. I got two weeks on harvest and

261
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,519
we're going to go through some CSI.

262
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,320
Matte blue sours TK times pure OG Kush.

263
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,320
We're going to go sour diesel times uh

264
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
you know pure OG. We're going to try all

265
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,000
these different little uh little strange

266
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
skank dogs. We got skank dogs and

267
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,480
flowers man. We got blue dream crosses

268
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,078
and flowers are getting close to semi

269
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,240
close to getting done. So we got stuff

270
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,919
on the

271
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,000
horizon. The I'm waiting for this

272
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,000
weather to shift y'all. I'm in a garage

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,440
right now. I'm freezing my balls off. I

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,799
can't, you know, I'm I'm a Kentucky boy.

275
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,600
My dad and and papa always said cold

276
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:17,439
weather makes

277
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,639
hard men and women. And you know, you

278
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,880
got to get it right these days. But, you

279
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,399
know, I'd said you you got a point

280
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,720
there. I'm from the south where it's

281
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,639
warm and it's hot. I work all day in 90

282
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,560
to 100 degree weather and that's hot.

283
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,319
So, you know, you put a you put a

284
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,319
Kentucky guy up here in Michigan and

285
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,040
what do you get? A freaking Super

286
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
Saiyan. You guys, I'm I'm here. I'm the

287
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,319
Messiah. I'm coming to save the

288
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,838
industry. I'm here to come and I'm

289
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,399
coming to save you guys. I'm here to

290
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,440
come to save the at tent home growers.

291
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,919
I'm really doing this, guys. But, you

292
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,320
know, I we won't always be doing wreck

293
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,240
weed products. I really don't like doing

294
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,879
that. It's just what it is. I ran out of

295
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,639
weed. My dad was sick. I had thris.

296
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,120
things just happened the way they did.

297
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,799
So, I ran out of bud. You know, I could

298
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,039
get a favor, but I'm not trying to get

299
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,879
favors. I don't like favors. You always

300
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,319
get favors. You get start everybody a

301
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,320
favor and then you don't want to be that

302
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,560
guy. So, we just deal with it. We smoke

303
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,720
a little wreck weed. We smoke a little

304
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,039
uh you know, I got some some random

305
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,639
outdoor [ __ ] I smoke on as well, too. I

306
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,240
got a bunch of the rank stranger jars

307
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,159
that I've been smoking on here or there,

308
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,000
too. But, man, I can't smoke a lot of

309
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,838
that hate [ __ ] I start getting

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,159
paranoid, you guys. I start looking out

311
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,839
the window like that the you know

312
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,399

00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:43,679
night and nobody pulls up hardly ever

317
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,560
right and they pull up lights on SUV

318
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,439
looking thing I don't know a Hummer or

319
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,078
something and dogs are barking and I'm

320
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
thinking like what the hell is this and

321
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,719
I look out the window and I see this

322
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,759
little bean pole of a man running

323
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,839
through my yard with the and I'm as he's

324
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,399
running back to his little car, his

325
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,560
phone is this way, bro. And he snaps a

326
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,879
picture like the most skillfully I've

327
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,039
ever seen in life. When he sent me the

328
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,120
picture, you know, on the the delivery

329
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,679
confirmation, it was a perfect picture.

330
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,440
I always thought to myself, this guy, I

331
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,838
if I had a company, I would hire this

332
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,040
guy because the skill that takes, the

333
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,880
precision, the precision, the uh, you

334
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:29,679
know, sense of urgency, the uh,

335
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,600
efficiency you could say. I love I loved

336
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:35,199
it. Okay, so

337
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,120
anyways, back to let's we jumping all

338
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
off topic, you guys. I know you don't

339
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
you don't mind so much, but I try to

340
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,599
keep it on topic. And I'll be honest,

341
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,440
the Keefe is kicking in. So, I'm going

342
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,879
to be bouncing around a little bit. So,

343
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,560
just please please forgive me. Okay. So,

344
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,200
at the end of the day, would I buy Kef

345
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,319
Keefs again? Hell yeah, I would. I'll be

346
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,720
honest. I would like a tropical flavor.

347
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,199
Uh, purple passion's cool. I like grape

348
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,040
soda. That's cool. Root beer's cool, but

349
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,479
I like I'm a more of a tropical guy,

350
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,879
like a coconut, pin colada, uh,

351
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,399
pineapple kind of guy. I don't. He's

352
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,600
saying that kind of sounds a little

353
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,720
fruity there, truck dog. But hey, I like

354
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,639
pina coladas. I I used to love tequila.

355
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,920
I do wild [ __ ] on tequila, but I can't

356
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,839
go there no more. I'm a uh I'm in a

357
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,360
happy relationship with a with a

358
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,600
beautiful woman. I can't be acting a

359
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,919
fool out there howling at the moon late

360
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,560
night. Uh chasing around riff raff,

361
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,399
chasing around little, you know, lot

362
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,239
lizards or whatever the things I used to

363
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,240
do back in the day. But, you know, I'd

364
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,278
buy Keef again. We bounced it around

365
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,560
today, y'all. Buy Keef extreme and keep

366
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:49,278
it extreme, you know. Anyways, is there

367
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,958
any products, any edibles, any drinks

368
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,039
that you have in your local area,

369
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,359
especially especially in the Michigan

370
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,360
area, uh, you know, that I could try to

371
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,440
track down and try out? Let me know in

372
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,199
the comments section below. Let me know

373
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,639
what what I should try to find. I'm

374
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,319
looking for some in the bud that you

375
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,240
guys recommended the last ones, but I

376
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,120
haven't seen much of that [ __ ] bro. I

377
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,639
I'll be honest with you. I'm looking

378
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,919
around. But it is what what it is. So,

379
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,360
if you got something, you know, you got

380
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,120
a couple more weeks of me buying some

381
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,159
Wede. So, if you got something you want

382
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,839
me to try out or find or buy or products

383
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,240
to try out, let me know in the comment

384
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,480
section below. Let me If you don't care

385
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,039
at all, if you think Wreck weed sucks

386
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,120
and you think I'm I suck, let me know

387
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,120
that too down there. [ __ ] it gets me

388
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
hyped up, you guys. You know, anytime

389
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,480
you guys take effort out of your all's

390
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,240
life or energies to watch a little bit

391
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,639
of my video, I really do appreciate it.

392
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,799
So, a negative or a positive comment is

393
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,000
appreciated. It really doesn't matter.

394
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,838
But, you know, this show thrives off of

395
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,440
engagement with you guys and gals out

396
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,519
there. Let me know I'm doing good. Let

397
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,440
me know if I'm doing bad. I'm trying the

398
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,959
best I can. You know, I'm not going to

399
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,360
be the best at it. I'm not going to get

400
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,198
everything right every single time. I

401
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,480
can really only speak from my own

402
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:03,198
experiences and tell you guys that. So,

403
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,079
if you guys got tips for me, my ego's in

404
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,240
the hot tub and that's where I left it.

405
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,879
So, out there at Lake St. Clair with

406
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,440
Denalian crew, I left it in there that

407
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,600
night. They punished me and took me in

408
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,959
took me in ways that I could have never

409
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,560
even imagined. And I left my ego in that

410
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,159
mazola soaked lubed up hot tub. And you

411
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,479
know, if you got something to tell me or

412
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,159
teach me or you got an opinion or

413
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
something, let me know. I'm trying to be

414
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,838
a better grower. I'm trying to be a

415
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,958
better podcaster guy. I'm trying to be a

416
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,120
better person in life. You know, uh, a

417
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,000
lot of be a lot of people get it

418
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,679
twisted, you know. Uh, you know, in this

419
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,320
industry, there's a lot of drama and

420
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,319
stuff like that. You know, I'm not rock

421
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm not going to be leaving Matt. I'm

422
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,240
gonna be rocking out with the Breeders

423
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,399
Syndicate. I'm gonna be doing what I got

424
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,240
to do until I'm gone basically to the to

425
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,799
the death of me. So, don't get it

426
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,560
twisted. I ain't going anywhere. If you

427
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,799
like it, you like it. If you don't, you

428
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:07,119
don't. It is what it is. And that being

429
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:09,918
said, let's go ahead and jump over into

430
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,318
the products I use during my growths, at

431
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,520
least at the ones I have been using this

432
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,838
run. U you know, I'm kind of like Bitter

433
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,439
and some of the other guys recently. I,

434
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,359
you know, don't really necessarily like

435
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,120
to stick to one product. It's not really

436
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,359
about that. It's really about what makes

437
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,519
sense, what's cheap, what's available,

438
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,798
do I need it in a specific time, am I

439
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,480
going to be able to get it? Do they have

440
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,480
it at the hydro store? Do I got to go

441
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,720
through Amazon? There's several several

442
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,919
variables that go into that. Uh, and

443
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,360
really, my biggest advice

444
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:43,919
is if you got something that you're uh

445
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,399
looking at uh that's maybe a little bit

446
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,759
too expensive for you, try to go into a

447
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,080
hydro store. And you could do this

448
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,519
online as as well, but I I'm a visual

449
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,599
person. It helps me when I have

450
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,759
everything in front of me. Try to go and

451
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,519
look through different products and look

452
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,079
for the similar ingredients to what

453
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,000
you're trying to uh you know replace or

454
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,439
substitute for. And this ain't going to

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,919
work for everything because there are

456
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,240
some products that are specialized or

457
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,200
not specialized or whatever. So, but for

458
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,200
me, we'll talk about it here in a minute

459
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
uh about the Can of Bloom and a couple

460
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,400
of the other Cana line products uh that

461
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,558
I really can't afford or don't want to

462
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,240
pay for. and I've substituted a few

463
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,240
things. So, we're going to jump into

464
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,480
what I like to use. Maybe this is going

465
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,240
to be for people that are new beginners.

466
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,160
Uh people that are just starting out

467
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,160
out, you know, that don't really know

468
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,279
what they're doing, maybe or maybe you

469
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,279
do know what you're doing, but you're

470
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,200
looking for a new strategy. You know,

471
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,359
I'm not an organic grower as far as

472
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,279
organics are concerned. It's about as

473
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,918
organic as I can get is when I grow

474
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,960
outside in the dirt, and that's about as

475
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,280
as organic as it gets. you know, uh, I

476
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,880
live, you know, I got to climb stairs. I

477
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,558
got to take stuff up a couple flights of

478
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,039
stairs. So, I'm not really trying to,

479
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,798
uh, carry, you know, a bunch of crap up

480
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,960
into the house other than I really need

481
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,839
to. And in all truthfulness, I would

482
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,880
switch to Coco if I, you know, if I,

483
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,759
well, I mean, if I just had the

484
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,000
products, I mean, I probably would

485
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,558
switch to Coco. I got the Cocoa Can of

486
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,640
Amb products, but I, you know, it's a

487
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,960
hard switching up or or doing multiple

488
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
different techniques or styles of

489
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,480
growing at the same time. I've been

490
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,919
wanting to do some Coco. I've done a

491
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,360
little bit. I've done some vegging and

492
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,480
stuff like that. I think, you know,

493
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,599
Coco's great. Uh I think or Coco choir,

494
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,200
whatever you want to call it. I think

495
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,959
it's great. I've seen people in the

496
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,279
Discord. Shout out Local and a few other

497
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,440
people. Uh Bidder and a few a few of the

498
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,000
other guys and gals in the Discord get

499
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,038
great results from Cocoa Choir and stuff

500
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,960
like that. Massive yields, quick growth.

501
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,558
I think for me personally, I you know,

502
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,720
if I was going to do Coco, I'd want to

503
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,558
take clones into Coco. You know, I

504
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,319
probably would mess up starting off in

505
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,678
cocoa. It seems like a lot of people do

506
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,439
from what I can pick up from the

507
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,600
Discord. A lot of people have trouble

508
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,919
starting them off in in the cocoa. And

509
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,439
and that's probably just, you know, not

510
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,880
giving enough or giving a little bit too

511
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,558
much of that because and sometimes

512
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
people don't do stuff like pre-oak your

513
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,240
your meat, you know, your your whatever

514
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,919
you're growing in basically. And and

515
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,440
give it some cow mag. Give it especially

516
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120
in the cocoa. There's nothing in there.

517
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,759
It's inert. So, it needs something to

518
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,038
get going. But personally, I like to

519
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,919
start my seeds in in Promix because it's

520
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,079
real airy. You going to get a lot of uh

521
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,840
you know, air to the roots. You going to

522
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,359
get quick growth, especially in those

523
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,519
beginning stages. It doesn't have a lot

524
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,119
of nitrogen and things in it that's

525
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,400
going to uh you know, burn your

526
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,599
seedlings. So, it's going to get you

527
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,000
where you need to be. You got about

528
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,359
seven to 10 days on uh Promix um you

529
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
know, for your seedlings and things like

530
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,279
that. So, and then you can start giving

531
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,599
them some food. But I like to start

532
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:43,200
giving them real low dose of uh you know

533
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:45,119
cow mag and uh the can of terra. I

534
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,480
actually run the can of terra lines.

535
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,959
That's the stuff I have the most

536
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,200
experience with. I do have can of A and

537
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,919
B for cocoa but I don't really use it a

538
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,200
lot and I haven't used it a lot. So I

539
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,919
can really only speak about uh the can

540
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,840
of Terara stuff. So let's jump in that.

541
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,360
And I'm starting to slur my words a

542
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,678
little bit. I can tell I'm slowing down

543
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,599
and that ke extreme just keeping it

544
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,400
extreme. So, please bear with me and

545
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,959
let's make it through. You know, uh I

546
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,600
try not to smoke a lot or whatever

547
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,440
today. So, I and I'm running on a a

548
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,279
pretty empty stomach. I did make some

549
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,120
pizza, but I just took a few bites to

550
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,720
get me through the show because I feel

551
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,719
like, you know, when you got an empty

552
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,919
stomach, you going it's just going to

553
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,240
hit you a little harder, you know. So, I

554
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,679
will say we're going to jump over into

555
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,759
the products. We've been trying to get

556
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,440
to it for almost 20 minutes, and I do

557
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,440
apologize, but let's get to it.

558
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,798
Also, if you d if you're a little dab ho

559
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,960
and you're trying to wonder what torch

560
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,119
you want to get, pick up one of these

561
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,400
freaking things, dude. Blazer, Big Shot,

562
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,158
GT8000. They make different ones,

563
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,320
different pro, you know, different

564
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,120
levels, different sizes, different

565
00:21:54,319 --> 00:22:00,158
numbers. There's probably a GT69, I

566
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,319
would hope, a 420, whatever. You know,

567
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,960
these things are pretty cool. I like

568
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,279
them. They're great for dabbing. I ain't

569
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,880
a big time dabber, but when I do dab,

570
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,319
this is what I'm

571
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,960
using. I ain't sponsored by none of

572
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,599
these guys, gals, but if you want to

573
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,000
hook me and Matt up, let's get it going.

574
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:24,480
We don't make no ad revenue, so let's

575
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,480
get it popping. All right, first things

576
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:33,038
first. Some people, you don't got a pH.

577
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:36,000
All right. But I would recommend it. Get

578
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,640
familiar with your water. Check your pH.

579
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Don't have to be every day, but check it

580
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,919
often because it can fluctuate. For

581
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,480
example, I'm running off well water. I

582
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,759
check my pH every single time. Because

583
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,519
if it's raining or if it's dry, my pH is

584
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,400
going to fluctuate dramatically

585
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,480
depending. Right. Also, when you're

586
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
adding nutrients to your water, give it

587
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,798
a little bit time to chill. All right.

588
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,159
eggs. Mix it up five minutes, let it

589
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,279
chill, then go ahead and pH it after

590
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,720
that. You don't want to be mixing [ __ ]

591
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,879
up. It's got you got to let it balance

592
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,038
out. Balance that pH out a little bit.

593
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,720
Especially you don't be dumping can of

594
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,319
like for example the can of terra stuff

595
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,880
that I use for for uh for during flour.

596
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,798
That stuff will drop your pH from like

597
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,240
seven or eight. If you starting, you put

598
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,079
that in there, it'll drop it all the way

599
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,440
down to like four or five. It's freaking

600
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,759
crazy. So, make sure you're checking

601
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,759
your pHes, guys. That's all. It's

602
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,599
simple. You can use a pen. The Blue Lab

603
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,679
pens work good. The more expensive

604
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,038
probes work good, but personally, I got

605
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,320
away from using them because I felt like

606
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,759
every time I was turning around, they

607
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,038
were drying out. I was dropping them. I

608
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,200
was breaking them. They were breaking on

609
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,798
me. So, I actually just used the General

610
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,880
Hydroponics

611
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,679
uh little color, what do you call this

612
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,679
little thing? I don't even know what

613
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,679
it's called. Little test indicator with

614
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,919
the different colors on it. All you do

615
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,840
is you fill up this bottle halfway. You

616
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,000
put in three, four, five drops in there

617
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,199
and you match it up with the colors. Uh,

618
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
you know, if you're color blind, this

619
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,720
probably gonna help you out much. You're

620
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,038
probably gonna stick to a pin uh pen.

621
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,038
But this is what help works for me. You

622
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,119
know, my stuff's pretty consistent

623
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,480
because I do run everything through an

624
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,158
RO system. People say, "Drocile, why are

625
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,000
you running it through an RO system,

626
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,200
wasting all that money and power in a

627
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
water?" Well, the the whale water I have

628
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,400
comes out anywhere from 3 400 ppms,

629
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,079
bros. I don't know what that is. It's

630
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,919
been tested. They say it's fine, but I

631
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,240
ain't risking it for the biscuit. I want

632
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,559
to start at a base level, a neutral

633
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,400
level, or not a neutral level, I guess I

634
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,079
should say, but just I want to start at

635
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,919
zero. I don't want nothing in that water

636
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,079
so I know what I'm putting in there. I

637
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,080
know how I can keep track of it. I know

638
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,000
exactly what's going into there. I'm not

639
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,558
a scientist, you guys. I can't tell you

640
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,720
what's biologically on a biological

641
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:51,278
level what's going on in that soil. I

642
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,798
don't really know. I just know that at

643
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:58,880
the end of the day, I need Mountain Dew,

644
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,480
Kim Dog blunts, and big titties. And

645
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,120
your plants going to need stuff, too,

646
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,839
just like a human being would. You know,

647
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,719
they need stuff. They they need uh, you

648
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,599
know, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,

649
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,640
they need micronutrients, cow mags, they

650
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,399
need amino acids, all this stuff that is

651
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
really over my head and probably a lot

652
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,278
of over your guys's head. But the thing

653
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,679
that you got to remember is hours and

654
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:28,558
experience are required to grow cannabis

655
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,200
greatly. I you know you can come in, you

656
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,960
can get a good run or two and you could

657
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,000
have a bad run from the beginning. I've

658
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,720
seen it all the way. Environments range

659
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,319
all over the place guys, gals, excuse

660
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,919
me. When I was in Kentucky, I didn't

661
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:49,079
have any problems hardly ever. no pest,

662
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,000
no PM, no problems

663
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:53,519
whatsoever. But the the the climate was

664
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,319
more stable there. I didn't have big

665
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:59,278
fluctuations. Here in Michigan, you go

666
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:01,439
from 70 degrees one day uh to the next

667
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,240
day, it's 26 and it's snowing, so you

668
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,558
got big fluctuations. So, you have to be

669
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,880
flexible. You have to be elastic. You

670
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,720
have to be able to to learn and adapt

671
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,039
yourself to your garden at all time. But

672
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,519
there is a language that you can read

673
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,359
that you can speak to your plants. And I

674
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,240
ain't getting hippie dippy on you. I'm

675
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,759
just saying if you watch your plants,

676
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,159
you can read a language. They'll tell

677
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,919
you what they need. You know, all we're

678
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,720
doing is giving them what we think they

679
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,080
need. And every plant, every expression

680
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,440
is going to want different things.

681
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,038
They're going to consume water at

682
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,278
different levels. So, there's no real

683
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,960
right way to do this or say this, but at

684
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,519
the end of the day, we're going to give

685
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,240
them a battery of food and nutrients,

686
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,798
micronutrients, all these little things

687
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,480
that they they they could need or not

688
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:47,839
need potentially. We don't really know,

689
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,640
do we really? We're just throwing stuff

690
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,879
in pots. I feel like science in and out.

691
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,440
But they do need stuff on a base level,

692
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,200
right? So, you're going to give them

693
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,720
this little battery pack, which is your

694
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
pot of soil, and that's what's going to

695
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,200
get you there. Uh, but sometimes if

696
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,798
you're like me, you're growing in onegon

697
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,919
pots and what's in that one gallon pot

698
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,000
ain't gonna get you all the way to

699
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,600
flower, bro. Sometimes you you growing

700
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,359
from seed like your boy Chuck Dog. By

701
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,519
the way, all my grows are from seed.

702
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,359
None of those videos are from clone. So,

703
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,599
make sure you understand where I'm

704
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,678
coming from. I've done taken my grows to

705
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,000
the next freaking level, you guys. And

706
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,440
you can see it in you could you could

707
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,880
see it in the proof. The proof is in the

708
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,400
pudding. They say in the pictures and

709
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,919
the videos. So, and your boy's able to

710
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,400
keep Kim 91 happy. Okay? They ain't

711
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,840
melting on me. You don't see me. My

712
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,519
Kim's melting on me, fam. Cannibalizing.

713
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:44,240
Hell no. That's for suckers. But at the

714
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,158
end of the day, you know, where were we

715
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,880
at? We lost track. The Keith's getting

716
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,720
to me. We're on We're talking about uh

717
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,240
different products and all this stuff.

718
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Oh, batteries. Battery your battery

719
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,440
bank. What do you plan? So, if you're

720
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,720
growing in smaller pots, you know, you

721
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,320
you're going you're going to need some

722
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,839
food. You're going to need some some

723
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,759
bottled nutrients. You're going to need

724
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,599
some uh dried amendments. You're going

725
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,839
to need however you going to do it.

726
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,398
Organic guys, I'm sorry. I don't got you

727
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,519
really. Y'all up here harvesting kelp

728
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,558
out the ocean and sprinkling on your

729
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,079
plants or something. I don't really

730
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,359
know. You guys got to We'll bring We're

731
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,798
going to bring some organic guys on

732
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,798
here. We're going to have them teach you

733
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,519
guys how to do the organics, you know.

734
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,359
But, you know, your plants are a weed.

735
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,599
They'll grow anywhere. almost any

736
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,158
conditions for the most part. They don't

737
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,558
they can use a lot of this. They can go

738
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,080
without a lot of that. So, you know,

739
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,798
your plants are never going to die on

740
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,960
you overnight. If you're new, just be

741
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,440
patient. Growing weed is all about

742
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,120
patience and just being vigilant and

743
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,919
watching your plants and and trying to

744
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,839
to be preventative. So, uh, before you

745
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,919
have run into problems or or and just

746
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,079
keeping your environment stable and and

747
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,880
to where your plant can really enjoy its

748
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:56,158
health or enjoy itself and get that good

749
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,559
health, fam. That's all it's about. So,

750
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,760
you really want to start off pH. That's

751
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,119
going to help you out a lot. Especially

752
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,919
if you're doing what I'm doing. You want

753
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,199
to pH, guys. And really, you there's all

754
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,240
kinds of products out there. I know you

755
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,880
guys are going to say, "Well, you can

756
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,480
get some citric

757
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,200
acid." I know you can't. I've heard it a

758
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,960
million times from you guys, but I just

759
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,120
me I'm talking about what I use because

760
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,880
I'm I'm lame like that. I just order

761
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,879
[ __ ] right? PH

762
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:27,839
up, pH down. Let me see it. There you

763
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:29,599
go. It's this one. PH down. Acid, fam. I

764
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,000
know y'all know about some acid. Maybe

765
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,158
we'll talk about some acid stories on

766
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,319
one of the shows here coming up. Not

767
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,880
today, though. But you you got to get

768
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,119
you some pH, right? Another thing I like

769
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,600
to have on hand at all times is cloning

770
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,158
gel. It comes in many different sizes,

771
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:48,398
many shapes, many uh different

772
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,440
varieties. It comes in powders and gels

773
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:54,959
and sprays and dips and chips and salsa.

774
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,720
Man, I'm getting hungry. Uh but I just

775
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,319
ordered this cheap [ __ ] off of Amazon.

776
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,759
I've used Clone X. I've used other

777
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,960
products. They all work about the same.

778
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,558
It's a rooting compound. Uh just uh here

779
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,319
I'll show it up to the camera. There it

780
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,079
is. I don't know anything about the

781
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,599
company. don't really care. I don't got

782
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,079
enough time to break down every single

783
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,959
company that I buy stuff from. If I, you

784
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,480
know, and and and figure out if they

785
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,919
what they've done in their life, I don't

786
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,720
really know. We're all consumers. We all

787
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,080
buy products all the time. Uh, you know,

788
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,759
you go into Walmart, you buy a pack of

789
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,759
soda pops, you don't you're not thinking

790
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,599
about the the owners of the stuff. Who

791
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,278
cares? You know, I'm I'm trying to I'm

792
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,240
just trying to put on a show for you

793
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,759
guys. So, you guys want to know how I'm

794
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,240
growing? This is how we're doing it.

795
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,158
Another thing you gonna need,

796
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,038
measurement device. Don't be in there

797
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,559
with a one millimeter vial dipping, you

798
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,278
know, little one millimeter here or

799
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,960
there. No, that's weak [ __ ] [ __ ] These

800
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,960
plants, they could take a lot more than

801
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,079
that, guys. Get you something to measure

802
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,360
your [ __ ] out with so you can know. See,

803
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,038
when you're doing this, you're getting

804
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,319
data. You should be. You should be You

805
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:57,679
don't have to be writing it down because

806
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,879
some people going to be in places that

807
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,640
you probably shouldn't be writing [ __ ]

808
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,720
down. But take mental notes. when this

809
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,720
plant is this age and I'm giving it this

810
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,720
much, uh, how's it responding? And when

811
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,558
you do this with hundreds of plants over

812
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,240
a long periods of time, thousands of

813
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,678
plants, whatever your gig is, you're

814
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,798
going to see patterns and you should

815
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,038
know, at least you should notice

816
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,200
patterns. Also, I'd recommend if you're

817
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,200
doing a can of product or any product,

818
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,440
always follow their little charts

819
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,319
online. And I love Cana because they,

820
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,240
you know, they're a little bit more

821
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,240
expensive on the expensive side on a lot

822
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,720
of their products, but I do love their

823
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,359
their A&amp;B and I do love their uh the

824
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,319
Terra and the Vegas, I think it is. Um

825
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,678
or however you say it. Uh and I do love

826
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,759
their little charts that they got

827
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,240
online. I use a five gallallon bucket to

828
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,599
mix all my stuff up in. Uh and that and

829
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,440
that's what I like to use. You know, I

830
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,959
like to use little charts and I and I

831
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,720
they have different options on there for

832
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,120
light feeding, normal feeding, heavy

833
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,880
feeding. So, if you're new, start with

834
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,639
the light feeding. Do you know what I

835
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,000
mean? Go through it. Don't ramp up to

836
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,600
heavy feeding trying to get them to

837
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,679
pump. Go easy on them, especially in

838
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,759
those first few weeks of their life. Uh

839
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,600
especially uh you know, yeah, let them

840
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,640
chill. But once you especially when you

841
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,558
get a flower, pump them some [ __ ]

842
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
You know what I'm saying? And there's

843
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,398
nothing wrong with that, y'all. You want

844
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,240
to get the biggest less. You only got so

845
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,639
many grows in your lifetime. You know

846
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,880
what I'm saying? If somebody said, you

847
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,720
know, you can only drive a car 50 more

848
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,640
times in your lifetime or truck,

849
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,240
whatever have you, snowmobile, uh, you

850
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,960
know, stripper,

851
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,319
whatever. Do you want the best or you

852
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,000
want you want to do the best or you want

853
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,158
to go slow in your in a car? You want to

854
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,240
go fast? I want to go fast. I'm a fast

855
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,600
guy. I like doing fast [ __ ] Uh, you

856
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,120
know, that's what that's what it is.

857
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,038
Efficiency. I'm all about that. That's

858
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,479
what I like to do. You know, some people

859
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:45,359
going to leave nasty comments say, "You

860
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,200
don't know what you're talking about,

861
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,439
Chuck. you don't really grow whatever.

862
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,798
Go look at the videos. I I don't know

863
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,558
who wouldn't smoke that. I'm getting

864
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,398
more compliments than I've ever got. So,

865
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,240
I know it's not just in my brain. I'm

866
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,239
seeing it visually all this language

867
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,480
that we talk about. We We see the

868
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,079
changes in our plants. We see the visual

869
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,558
changes. We see them perk up. We see

870
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,240
them turn green. We see them beautiful.

871
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,079
We look at everybody else's grows and we

872
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,038
think to

873
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:13,278
ourselves, "The [ __ ] are they doing?"

874
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:15,679
But that being said, let's keep it

875
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:18,240
rocking. Another important thing, cow

876
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,000
mag. Some people don't like cow mag,

877
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,240
some people like to get it from other

878
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,759
other ways, you know, whatever. Thing I

879
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,919
like about cow mag is you can never

880
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,839
really give a plant too much of it. Just

881
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,080
follow the back. One to five. I think

882
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,079
it's 1 to three mill milliliters per

883
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,879
gallon. Uh when you're starting off a

884
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,398
plant, go light, guys. 1 milll is fine.

885
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,000
But then as you get up and you're

886
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,918
starting to get, you know, a lot of

887
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,278
growth, especially in the flower, you

888
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,759
know, you won't want to be doing, I

889
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,839
think it's like five five per gallon. So

890
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,079
25 milliliters if you're, you know,

891
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,720
doing a five gallon bucket basically. So

892
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,960
just use common sense. Start low, rev

893
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,519
up. Okay. Now, I will say on Cal

894
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:02,159
Mag things like KimD, I think even my

895
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,240
couple my triangle Kush uh S1's uh what

896
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,000
or yeah, triangle a couple other a

897
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,759
couple other plants especially in this

898
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,199
run. This ain't going to be that ain't

899
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,838
going to be enough. You need to give

900
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,838
them more of this or you can use some of

901
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,078
these other products I'm about to show.

902
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,239
Uh but you definitely need your cow mac,

903
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,480
guys. You know, cow meck super

904
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,838
important. A lot of people will underuse

905
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,838
it. A lot of people don't realize they

906
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,199
could just simply fix their plants. You

907
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,519
know, I can't really show you guys

908
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,878
pictures and break it down uh for

909
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,398
everything on here because we'll get

910
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:31,598
another strike. I would love to. We're

911
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,878
working on that though. We're going to

912
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,079
work on it. We're going to fix problems

913
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,078
on plants. We're going to grow. We're

914
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,000
going to do stuff for y'all on camera. I

915
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,800
got a new camera coming. New microphones

916
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,119
on the way. No more games. No surrender.

917
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,039
No more treat. Truck Dog's here to stay.

918
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,399
All right. We're going to freaking

919
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,559
battle. We're going We're building the

920
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,559
army right now. Uh we're doing

921
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:53,759
everything we need to do. Shout out Troy

922
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,759
over at I Love We live. We tuned in with

923
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,200
all the Breeder Syndicate guys and gals.

924
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,599
We jumped in there, hung out with them,

925
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,000
douche [ __ ] his pants on live. Uh go

926

check him out, you know, whatever. We're

927
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,358
make we're building a community, you

928
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,200
know. We're having fun and we're we're

929
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,719
talking weed. That's what we want to do,

930
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,078
y'all. We want to smoke weed. We want to

931
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,480
make friends. We want to have a good

932
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,000
time.

933
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,358
Cowme can never have too much of it. Oh,

934
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
messed the video up there for a second,

935
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:24,119
but we're back. Cow mag. Never too much

936
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,039
of it. Another thing that's super

937
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,358
important, mosquito bits. You're saying,

938
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:34,079
"Ch, what the heck's a mosquito bit

939
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,078
going to do in your garden for me, bro?"

940
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:42,559
Well, believe it or not, I can

941
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:45,838
read. Mom, I dropped out third grade

942
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,838
because I was certified BA. And mom's

943
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,838
got me on hooked on phonics. Believe it

944
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:54,159
or not, it worked.

945
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:58,320
But today we're talking about mosquito

946
00:35:54,159 --> 00:36:00,000
bits, dunks, powder, sauce, whatever.

947
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,039
These are the little bits right here. I

948
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,400
like them. I've had this bag going on

949
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:08,559
for [ __ ] a year. It lasts a long time.

950
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,440
Get some cuz guess what? Read the

951
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,880
package right there below. What's it

952
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,400
say? What's it say right there? controls

953
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,440
fungusnats

954
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,559
larvae. It's going to help you on your

955
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,358
larvae or your your fungusnat larvae, I

956
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,639
should

957
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:26,480
say. So, you got to have this for your

958
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,639
larvas, bro. You got to take care of

959
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,079
your little if you got mosqu I got a

960
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,838
mosquito sometimes in my room. I'm

961
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,760
hoping it's taking care of mosquitoes. I

962
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,838
live next to a swamp, you know, shout

963
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,800
out Michigan, but damn, everything is

964
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,320
swampy up here, you know. Uh, get these

965
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,400
mosquito bits. They're gonna take care

966
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,559
of your fungus nats. And it really does

967
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,240
work. Last summer, I didn't really use a

968
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:50,159
whole lot of this. I'll be honest. I

969
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:52,639
slacked off gnats everywhere. Right now,

970
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,879
I can't find a gnat one. Maybe one. I'll

971
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:58,239
see one when I only time I'll see one is

972
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,760
when I crack open some new soil and I,

973
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,519
you know, plant some seedlings. I'll see

974
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,839
one or two flying around for a day, but

975
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,759
I give them hell with this. And it takes

976
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,320
it takes care of them. Get you some of

977
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,800
these. The dunks, the Holy [ __ ] The

978
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,559
dunks, the powders, the whatever. We'll

979
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,359
take a little sip. Another Keefe extreme

980
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,358
because we keep it

981
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,639
extreme. I know I'm going through a lot

982
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,839
of [ __ ] It's going to be hard to

983
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,679
understand, but we going to go through

984
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,719
more of this [ __ ] If you got questions,

985
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,319
drop it in the thing below the comment

986
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,399
section. I'm just trying to show you

987
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,079
guys there's visual proof. Go look at my

988
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,200
[ __ ] if you really care that much. Go

989
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,960
look at my gardens over on my

990
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,399
Instagrams. And uh yeah, we're going

991
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,920
through what I use. People ask all the

992
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,200
time, "What do you use?" I swear I get

993
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
two or three questions a day. What are

994
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:49,118
you using, Chuck? Freaking stuff looks

995
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:49,118
fire, bro. Well, we're going through

996
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:56,400
it. Drop me a comment. Drop me a like.

997
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,559
I'm freezing my dick off right now, but

998
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,400
we're going. It's good for me. You know,

999
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,838
sometimes suffering is good for you.

1000
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,519
Remember that. You got to go through the

1001
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,039
struggles of life and the pain of life

1002
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,559
to come out on top. You got to

1003
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,358
experience. You got to go through bad,

1004
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:13,239
the good, the mediocre, the boring, the

1005
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:17,679
exciting to become the ultimate human

1006
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:19,679
being. Another thing I love to use is

1007
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,919
the recharge. There's different probably

1008
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,480
better products, you know, whatever. I

1009
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,760
like the recharge. Not really uh because

1010
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,240
it's the greatest thing in the world,

1011
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,680
but I got some of it and it was cheap at

1012
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,838
the time. I've had it for a little

1013
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,519
while, but I like this for my little uh

1014
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:34,799
you know, my little assets and things

1015
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,159
like that. you know, it's got a lot of,

1016
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,800
you know, just look on the back of your

1017
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,480
product products, guys. That's all you

1018
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,320
got to do. Look up what a cannabis

1019
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,400
requires and look on the back of your

1020
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,880
products. Do some reading. Don't just

1021
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,160
watch videos like these and say, "Oh,

1022
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,640
that that's the best thing in the

1023
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,920
world." No, you could use all kinds of

1024
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,920
stuff. You don't have to use this. You

1025
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,838
can use cheap stuff. Don't think just

1026
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,440
because your favorite YouTuber uses this

1027
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,358
this thing that it's the best in the

1028
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,200
world. Sometimes it's just that this is

1029
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,119
what it was at the store. This is what I

1030
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,559
was I was I was [ __ ] baked out of my

1031
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,000
mind went into a hydro store and the

1032
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,759
dude was like, "You need some of this."

1033
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,760
Sometimes it's uh you know, the

1034
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,160
packaging looks pretty cool. You know,

1035
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,599
sometimes, you know, uh it could be a

1036
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,879
lot of things, but you know, you look on

1037
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,440
the back of stuff and it tells you all

1038
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,358
the [ __ ] that it has. You know, got your

1039
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,800
fulvic acids, all that stuff. I, you

1040
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,039
know, I'm not going to break it all down

1041
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,880
for you. I'm not a scientist, you know.

1042
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:30,199
I just I just listen to the guys that

1043
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,320
tell me what to do, you know. Join the

1044

1046
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,160
I'm implementing everything I've been

1047
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,880
taught from those guys, those gals.

1048
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:44,719
Shout out Peaches. Shout out Miss Jill.

1049
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,960
By the way, Miss Jill, we got that TGAC

1050
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,239
space glue rocking out. Shout out

1051
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,400
Matt. That is a freebie. He's got the

1052
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,159
space glue. Got a better camera coming

1053
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,559
on the way, guys. And gals. I promise

1054
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,480
you I spent $200 on this freaking swivel

1055
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,320
camera, dude. it. This thing's on a

1056
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,440
motorized deal where it's gonna turn and

1057
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,920
everything. I'm gonna set up a little

1058
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,240
spot over here so you can follow me from

1059
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,599
there to over here in the garage and we

1060
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,199
gonna do some videos. Like I said, we

1061
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,800
going to rock out on the grill videos,

1062
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,719
y'all. We're going to show them what

1063
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,400
breeder syndicates all about. No

1064
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,279
surrender, no tree. Got a couple more

1065
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,880
packs of skank dogs. I know, I know. I'm

1066
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,960
sorry. They're sold out. You guys are

1067
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,880
saying, "But Chug Dog, you're over here

1068
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,720
hug, you know, hogging all the skank

1069
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,200
dogs." Well, fam, I'm trying to do a big

1070
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:31,039
pop here soon. And when I do, uh, I'll

1071
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,559
make some seeds or something if, you

1072
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,759
know, or whatever maybe with them. I

1073
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,199
don't know. We gonna find a keeper

1074
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,960
first. We gotta find something good. We

1075
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,838
gotta find something good. You know, Rob

1076
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,440
saying there ain't going to be no more

1077
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:40,719
skank dog seeds. So, I'm a little bummed

1078
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,639
about that. So, we got to hold on to

1079
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,879
these with everything we got. Shout out

1080
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,559
Seed Trip Rob. Man, I love I'm loving

1081
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,480
the skank dog. I got three or four of

1082
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,279
them going right now and another two

1083
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,760
chilling in veg just waiting. Uh, I'm

1084
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,839
loving it, bro. But anyways,

1085
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,160
so we got the skank dolls, we got the

1086
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,679
the glue, space glue in this week. We

1087
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,440
got a couple other things, but we're

1088
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,799
going to keep it on the grow products. I

1089
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,639
just want to shout out Miss Jill there

1090
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,400
for a second. Another one that I like

1091
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,239
that I that I I'll be honest, I really

1092
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,079
didn't find much use for it before in

1093
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:15,519
Kentucky. But at the time, I was a

1094
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,440
pretty noob noob still, I would say, or

1095
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,800
newer. I'm still a noob, but you know, I

1096
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,240
didn't realize how much calcium and

1097
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,839
stuff was and minerals and things were

1098
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,318
in my water in the city water down

1099
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,599
there. So, when I implemented some of

1100
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,119
these products before, I didn't really

1101
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,000
notice a big deal. So, like we said

1102
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,440
earlier, some of you people ain't going

1103
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,599
to need some of these products. But when

1104
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,358
I'm using

1105
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:38,640
Roro and this product here in particular

1106
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:42,559
is a guy green basalt rock dust. And all

1107
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:45,838
it is is some minerals, bro. We got some

1108
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,759
calcium in here. We got some uh mang

1109
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,078
magnesium. We got some iron and we got

1110
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,359
some manganesees. And really what what

1111
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,480
this is is when we're talking about

1112
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,639
earlier with cow mag if it ain't enough

1113
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,800
uh you know there's going to be some of

1114
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,719
these products going to be lacking um

1115
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,720
stuff that could be important for your

1116
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,318
plants or whatever. You know uh I don't

1117
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,919
know if they do that on purpose on some

1118
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:07,440
of these products they obviously do with

1119
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,039
like the can of stuff and like that.

1120
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,880
There's certain products in the lines

1121
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:14,079
like the can of bloom that's going to be

1122
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,358
expensive when $400 for a five liter

1123
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,839
when one of these is like I think like

1124
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:22,880
70 bucks for the Terra Vega. So same

1125
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,318
size 500 bucks. Of course you know it's

1126
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,838
it is what it is. They got they're going

1127
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:27,838
to charge more for certain stuff.

1128
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,159
Certain ingredients require more money

1129
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,318
to to you know to make or whatever. But

1130
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:34,480
for the most part you can substitute or

1131
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,358
find different products to help you on

1132
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,199
your little way. I love implementing the

1133
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,480
any kind of dry amendment like this,

1134
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:44,000
especially for uh like my Chem 91s,

1135
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,719
stuff like that. Especially when I mix

1136
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,280
up my soil, I add a little bit of bit

1137
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,399
into this as well. And you know, and you

1138
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,400
would think all this stuff's going to

1139
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,680
burn your plants, guys. You think it's

1140
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,519
going to ruin your garden. I used to be

1141
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,039
that guy. I used to think, dang, like

1142
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,599
I'm just going to grow with with, you

1143
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,400
know, like ocean. I'm gonna grow with,

1144
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,760
you know, mixing a little strawberry or

1145
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,599
whatever and sprout and and frog. But

1146
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,880
now, the way I'm doing it now, and I I

1147
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,200
should have said this earlier, but I

1148
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,039
like to use ocean for, you know, what I

1149
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,439
grow in. I love that, you know, gets a

1150
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,679
lot of nitro uh nitrogen and other

1151
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,240
things in there. Uh, and I like to just

1152
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,358
pack that in there and grow in that.

1153
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,279
That being said, there's different

1154
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,679
options. Uh, I like to use that because

1155
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,920
I can use the Terra line from Cana with

1156
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,318
it. It works great. It's a a line that's

1157
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,639
specially, you know, designed uh, you

1158
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,119
know, to be grown in in stuff that's

1159
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:38,559
already got food and nitrogen, things

1160
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:42,000
like that already in it. So, at the end

1161
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,358
of the day, uh, the guy green or any

1162
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,920
kind of dry amendment like that, you're

1163
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,000
just really giving it making it

1164
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,039
available for the plant if it needs it.

1165
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,559
You know, you ain't trying to go

1166
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,400
overboard, but there are some plants

1167
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,159
that going to require more. If you see

1168
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,680
one that's having problems, you know,

1169
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,679
you can give it some dry amendments.

1170
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,960
Now, mind you, sometimes dry amendments

1171
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,399
ain't going to be your answer because

1172
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,639
sometimes they uh are slow release or

1173
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,559
sometimes they just take a a while to be

1174
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,879
active in the soil or being broke down

1175
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,960
into the soil to be, you know, available

1176
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,358
for the plant basically. So, that's that

1177
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,039
that being said, you got to be be

1178
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:16,639
conscious and kind of like do some

1179
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,480
reading and do a little research on that

1180
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,879
kind of stuff. I'm just explaining it to

1181
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,318
you how I I do I really like to use that

1182
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,480
kind of stuff for like a preventative

1183
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,559
thing. So if I slack off or miss

1184
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,358
something and it's just there in the

1185
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:31,759
soil ready to rip and I'm seeing great

1186
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:35,880
results with that um for you know for my

1187
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:40,880
main nutrient and uh

1188
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:44,160
veg as the Terra Vega which you know it

1189
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,160
is more expensive guys. It's going to be

1190
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,279
more expensive than probably what you

1191
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:51,039
really need to to ever buy. Uh but at

1192
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,640
the end of the day it's a great product.

1193
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,199
They haven't changed their product for

1194
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:58,559
like 25 years. It's the same thing. It's

1195
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:00,719
the same ingredients supposedly. Um, I

1196
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,639
never burn my plants with it. It It

1197
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,000
works great. Uh, especially with the

1198
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,759
ocean and like I was saying, all these

1199
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,280
things I'm I'm showing today, it's

1200
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,200
working great for me and I'm having

1201
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,599
great results and I think the videos and

1202
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:15,439
and the the p the proof is there. It's

1203
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,760
already there. So, I love it for veg.

1204
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,000
And man, when you're in veg using this

1205
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,079
stuff, don't be afraid to use it every

1206
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,760
day, every other day, that's what it's

1207
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,000
designed for, especially as your plants

1208
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,160
use up your soil, the food in the soil

1209
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,960
or in the ocean or whatever uh you're

1210
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,879
using. Don't be afraid to to give it

1211
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,519
give it to them. Just follow the follow

1212
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,800
what they recommend and it won't let you

1213
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,679
down. You don't have much to worry

1214
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,599
about. Um, another product I really like

1215
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:46,000
to use,

1216
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,559
uh, and this is like a once a week deal,

1217
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,559
every 10

1218
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:55,200
days, is some good old Meno honey

1219
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,119
molasses.

1220
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,480
Uh, this is a newer product I just

1221
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,160
started using

1222
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,880
and, you know, I can't tell you if it's

1223
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:09,838
making a giant drastic change in my

1224
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:12,559
garden. But because I don't run the Cana

1225
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,159
uh, Bloom, like the Bloom Boost Booster

1226
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:18,078
and stuff like that and a lot of the

1227
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:20,000
other products from Cana, I like to use

1228
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,039
a a few things to kind of kind of fill

1229
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,599
in the blanks, you know. And this is the

1230
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,960
Menoscino honey. Like I said, I just

1231
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,960
started using it. There's other products

1232
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,079
you could pick up, but really, like I

1233
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,960
said, you always just want to look at

1234
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,760
the back of your ingredients. And this

1235
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:40,760
here is made got a total nitrogen

1236
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,760
uh 4646%

1237
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,039
uh it's

1238
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,400
got different

1239
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:52,800
uh let's see phosphat phosphat. I can't

1240
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,760
talk you guys. I'm [ __ ] up on these

1241
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:59,839
kef this keef drink soluble pot ash. You

1242
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,599
get your K and let you get your P and

1243
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,318
your K from here. Let's just say that

1244
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,800
y'all. Jesus.

1245
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:10,239
Available. Yeah. So, strive for

1246
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,560
molasses. I mean, it's a newer product

1247
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:15,118
that I've been using just to boost my

1248
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,519
PM, my K's. Not really using it for

1249
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,760
nitrogen or anything like that, but you

1250
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:25,639
g you gonna get all your [ __ ] you need

1251
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:27,960
from this and your cow mag and your

1252
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:30,639
terra.

1253
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,240
But next thing when you're going into

1254
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,759
flower that I like to

1255
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:39,719
use for flour, I guess I should say

1256
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,720
mainly is the Terra Flores. And you

1257
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:45,519
know, it's a great product as well. I

1258
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,598
pump them hard. I just follow the chart

1259
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,199
and it works pretty easily. I haven't

1260
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,960
seen any burning. I haven't seen any

1261
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:54,000
major problems or anything at all

1262
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,639
really. Uh it's been a great great

1263
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,480
product. I have used uh BioBiz and a few

1264
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,799
of the other products. I and I've burnt

1265
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,880
my plants. I've done you know I feel

1266
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,359
like this is just a userfriendly really

1267
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,358
easy to use product. It is a little bit

1268
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:09,519
more on expensive side but it works good

1269
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,679
and it's reliable. And you know, when

1270
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:16,039
you're talking about popping a bunch of

1271
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:19,118
seeds, uh, you know, and different

1272
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:20,559
expressions, different cultivars, uh,

1273
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,680
you know, you want something you can be

1274
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,000
able to apply on a broad scale to to

1275
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,719
many different things, many cuts, seeds,

1276
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,639
whatever it is, uh, and be successful.

1277
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,159
That's really what it comes down to. You

1278
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,558
want to get that to the end of your

1279
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,639
flower and get that get that good smoke.

1280
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,760
Get them seeds or whatever it may may

1281
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:41,519
have you whatever you're doing.

1282
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,040
Um, but like I said, use the Flores, I

1283
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,480
think it's how you say how you say it. I

1284
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,039
don't even read it really to be honest

1285
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,039
with you. Flores. Flores. I don't know.

1286
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,599
Terra

1287
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:54,239
Flores. And

1288
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:56,000
then we got another product I've I've

1289
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,719
been

1290
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,039
uh using recent rec recently is uh

1291
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:04,799
Mother of All Blooms. It's like a boom

1292
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:07,199
blooster because I don't use the uh uh

1293
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,680
the Canon one. I use this this in

1294
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:12,159
combination with this uh this I think

1295
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,799
total like 40 50 bucks whereas like the

1296
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,558
Bloom Booster is like 400 bucks. So I

1297
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,160
don't know. I like to save some money so

1298
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,599
I can spend them on my Mountain Dews, my

1299
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:23,199
Hodags and and [ __ ] [ __ ] like that. But,

1300
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,640
you know, this is just gonna give you

1301
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,480
your um the way you use this, I should

1302
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,480
say, is you're gonna use it and when you

1303
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,400
the beginning of flower and then like

1304
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,119
towards the end of it, your last not

1305
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,318
your last few weeks, but you know, like

1306
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,440
just basically like week, well, we won't

1307
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:41,279
say a week because there's going to be

1308
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,838
people out there doing different

1309
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,160
varieties of stuff, but on a, you know,

1310
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:47,679
seven to nine, 10 week plant, you're

1311
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,558
going to be using this, you know, three

1312
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:52,719
or four weeks before, uh, the end, you

1313
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,359
know, for harvest. But you just all all

1314
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:58,078
it's doing is uh you know boosting up

1315
00:49:55,358 --> 00:50:00,960
your phosphorus and potassium levels get

1316
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,359
you going and uh really you just follow

1317
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,519
the the back, you know, it's like a

1318
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,759
tablespoon per gallon or add more, add

1319
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,519
less depending on where you're at. Um

1320
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,480
you know that the actual directions of

1321
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,079
it say you know uh can be used first

1322
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,280
week of flower to help introduce

1323
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,680
flowering. uh add mother all blooms

1324
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,240
during the last two to three weeks of

1325
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,960
flowering for added levels of phosphorus

1326
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:27,598
and potassium. The amount base nutrients

1327
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,400
may need to be reduced as such as 50%

1328
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,079
when using mother of all blooms

1329
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,960
overfeeding may burn plants. So there

1330
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,760
you go. I've used it uh this run and

1331
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,358
have you know haven't burnt any plants.

1332
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,200
You know like I was saying earlier I'm

1333
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,119
not a scientist. I don't know if this

1334
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,078
stuff is working or not other than what

1335
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,760
I can visually see. I'm not in I'm not,

1336
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,119
you know, this tall. I can't look in the

1337
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,160
soil. I don't know. I'm not in I don't

1338
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,720
got a PhD. So, all I can tell you is my

1339
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,879
plants are bigger and better. Plants

1340
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,959
I've ran before, same cultivars are

1341
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,960
bigger and better. Even hell, even some

1342
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,039
of the autoflowers I ran recently were

1343
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:08,559
bigger. I mean, the top the top cola on

1344
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:10,759
these ones were so big, bro, compared to

1345
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,920
the ones the same genetics I ran

1346
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:16,319
before. So, I don't know. I kind of feel

1347
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,318
like I'm I'm getting what I pay for, if

1348
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,558
that makes any sense. And I'm stretching

1349
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:22,079
these out over several grows, so it's

1350
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,119
not like you're using this all up real

1351
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,680
quick. But for the most part, that's

1352
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,920
pretty pretty much it. Uh, you know, if

1353
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,679
you guys got something to recommend me

1354
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,280
to use, I know I could do it better

1355
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:35,598
always and use the actual caner

1356
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,319
products, uh, you know, and stuff like

1357
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,559
that. Uh, but if you guys got something

1358
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:42,719
recommend me to use down in the comments

1359
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,720
section, let me know below. I love

1360
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,639
trying out new stuff. Maybe I'm doing it

1361
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,480
wrong. Maybe I'm doing it right. I don't

1362
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,440
know. I'm liking the way my shit's

1363
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,719
growing, so I'm having a good time.

1364
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,679
Anyways, last thing I wanted to talk

1365
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:58,159
about today for y'all as far as growing

1366
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,000
tips and growing equipment. I know y'all

1367
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:02,239
seen these before. This is a trim tray

1368
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,559
right here. Uh they usually come with a

1369
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:07,118
like a black bottom or a bottom piece so

1370
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,040
you can collect your little your little

1371
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,358
stuff that falls through your pollins or

1372
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:14,480
or or your little hash or whatever you

1373
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:16,719
whatever you got for mama's. But

1374
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,960
speaking of mama, she done beat my ass.

1375
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,118
She done hit me hit me right here. Can

1376
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,920
you see it? Let's see. See that on my

1377
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,880
nose? She done hit me with the

1378
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:28,639
[ __ ] habachi uh magic vibrating wand.

1379
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,640
You know big wands all the women's out

1380
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:31,759
to use on their coochis. She hit me

1381
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:32,799
across the head of the forehead the

1382
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,680
other day. I was trying to get her a

1383
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,240
little a little $50 square up with her

1384
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,919
and she she came out the house with that

1385
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,439
thing welded like that. She said, "What

1386
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,599
are you doing back here, boy?" She

1387
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,920
smacked me across the forehead and then

1388
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,519
that's how I got that cut right there.

1389
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,200
So, me and mom ain't real good right

1390
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,679
now. I love you, mom. If you watching, I

1391
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,838
love you. I'll be if you want to drop me

1392
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,719
off a plate of food, that'd be great.

1393
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:58,799
But trim trays, they come many different

1394
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,000
shapes, many different sizes. I like

1395
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,599
this one here because it's the first one

1396
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,039
I bought and I've had it for many years.

1397
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,119
It works great. You can put it in the

1398
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,239
dishwasher, get it nice and clean once

1399
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,000
you get done with it. Get a little

1400
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:12,479
pilings off there, have you? But mainly,

1401
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,159
I wanted to talk about this for using uh

1402
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,679
when you're sorting seeds. You know, a

1403
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,838
lot of people ask questions and I had

1404
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,639
questions like this when I started off.

1405
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:23,039
How do you separate your seeds from all

1406
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,400
that bud and all that all that crap?

1407
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,159
Well, how do I get my seeds out of

1408
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,639
there, bro? Let me know how you doing

1409
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,639
it. Well, if you don't have a seed

1410
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,920
separator or a seed m separating

1411
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:33,598
machine, whatever you want to call it,

1412
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,280
they make those. You can there's a

1413
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,599
couple guys on Instagram and there's

1414
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,680
plan plans for them on the internet that

1415
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,680
you can download to get your little seed

1416
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,919
blower going and and help you clean

1417
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:45,838
them. But if you're cheap like me and

1418
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,519
you ain't got a lot of money or space,

1419
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,358
you could use a tray like these. And I

1420
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,920
like this one here particular cuz it has

1421
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:54,400
the screen and a little lip right there.

1422
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,240
Because what happens is you going to

1423
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,680
take your tray like this. And you can

1424
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:59,598
take it like that if you want, but I

1425
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,519
like to take it just like this. I'll

1426
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:04,318
take my little all my little buds and my

1427
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:07,358
dried up stuff and my seeds, my my chaff

1428
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:10,079
and all that stuff. I'll start crunching

1429
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:12,639
it up just like that. As I'm doing it,

1430
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,640
them seeds are bouncing down this tray.

1431
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,159
You want to have it at an angle and them

1432
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:17,838
a lot of times them seeds will bounce

1433
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,759
over that white lip right there and

1434
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:22,239
catch right here for you. So, and then

1435
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,760
all your your shake and your trim and

1436
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:27,598
all that stuff will be caught up here

1437
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,119
and you simply just tilt it or you can

1438
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,960
pick them up, tilt your seeds out and

1439
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,400
get them out that way. And you sometimes

1440
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,318
you'll have to do a few runs depending

1441
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,240
on how much seed you got, depending on

1442
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,318
how dry it is, how not dry it is,

1443
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,799
whatever. Uh but for the most part you

1444
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:42,318
want to do is when it's really dry and

1445
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,160
uh it's really the best time and only

1446
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:46,400
time you want to do it. Sometimes like

1447
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,000
me though I have harvested stuff just to

1448
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,400
try it out you know when it's still wet

1449
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,519
and do it that way too. I mean it works.

1450
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,440
You don't want to do it that way

1451
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,679
necessarily but it does work. But

1452
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,480
another thing you could do to use this

1453
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,838
to for sorting seeds is put it like this

1454
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,280
just like how I'm sitting in front of

1455
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,880
you. And you want to mount you a little

1456
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,240
fan uh kind of like basically I got I

1457
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,960
feel like I almost got a booger in my

1458
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,358
nose. Get you a little fan pointing away

1459
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,280
from you or to the side of you. I like

1460
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:15,358
to do it away from you. And I'll put

1461
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,160
that little tray right there in front of

1462
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:20,639
it with the in between uh have the fan

1463
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:23,279
in between you and the tray and have

1464
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,639
that tray kind of tilted up like that.

1465
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,000
You you want to play around with you

1466
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,318
don't want to put it on full blast and

1467
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,559
blow all your seeds out, but you turn

1468
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:33,039
you you get that fan going and you just

1469
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,800
take that all that shake and your seeds

1470
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,639
and everything and you shake take it

1471
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,880
right there in front of that fan and

1472
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,879
have this below it and it'll blow a lot

1473
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,800
of that crap out for you. blow all that

1474
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,240
extra [ __ ] out for you, right? And

1475
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,000
you'll collect all your seeds down here

1476
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,519
at the bottom of your tray. And that's

1477
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,960
just a that's just how you have a good

1478
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,159
day when you're sorting seeds. Some

1479
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,920
people don't like it, some people love

1480
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:54,960
it. I like sorting seeds. I think it's

1481
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,639
freaking fun. Uh I got ADHD, so it helps

1482
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,798
me keep focused and gives me some

1483
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,639
something to do. And I guess really

1484
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:02,159
actually a lot. I think the last tip for

1485
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,719
today, I talked about this on the last

1486
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,960
episode. Denali, shout out Denali. You

1487
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,118
gave me these freaking uh what are

1488
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,119
these?

1489
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:14,039
Hydra Hydroarm. I don't know anything

1490
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:17,519
about Hydroarm, but

1491
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:19,119
these these uh little trimmers, bro,

1492
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,719
these have been fire. They haven't

1493
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,640
broke. A lot of these trimmers out here,

1494
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:24,399
I get the freaking spring pops out of

1495
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,759
them. These things have stayed sharp.

1496
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,920
These have been awesome. They got them

1497
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,520
at the hydro stores a lot of times. Uh

1498
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,119
you know, some people don't got go to

1499
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,639
hydro stores. I got them, but you know,

1500
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,480
maybe you could find that. That's a

1501
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,039
great great product. Great. works great

1502
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:42,639
for me. Sorry, my balls were balls are

1503
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:44,159
itching kind of for real. Um, but I

1504
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,558
guess really that's it as far as the

1505
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,318
grow tips are concerned for today. I

1506
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,640
hope that's helped y'all out some. If it

1507
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,000
hasn't, let me know. I know it's going

1508
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:53,519
to be boring for some of y'all older

1509
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,960
cats out there, but we're trying to

1510
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,559
attract some new people. We're trying to

1511
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,920
get it flowing. We're trying to get it

1512
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:03,359
going, you know. Uh, but I'd like to

1513
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,720
jump over into a weeder tip. I know you

1514
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:06,400
guys are saying a weed eater too tip.

1515
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:09,118
What the hell's that got to do with

1516
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,318
weed, bro? Well, it's called a weed

1517
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,880
eater, is it not? I think most of us are

1518
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:17,679
uh you know, people of outdoors, we have

1519
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,760
to keep stuff, you know, maintained and

1520
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:22,000
keep stuff trimmed up. If you got a

1521
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,119
little gorilla grow somewhere, you want

1522
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,358
to cut you a little spot, you going to

1523
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:28,400
take that weed eater up in there for you

1524
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,759
and get it rocking, you know. So, I

1525
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,480
wanted to give y'all a little weed eater

1526
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,400
tip for today. And I'm going to try to

1527
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,920
do this without unplugging a bunch of

1528
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,519
stuff or knocking anything over here

1529
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,798
real quick. But I got I might have to

1530
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,280
put my headset down for a second. Hold

1531
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:45,960
on. I'll be right back. Hold on. Hold

1532
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,960
on. Keep your sticks on the ice, boys.

1533
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,920
Y'all ain't never seen nothing like this

1534
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:12,159
on a weed podcast, have you? Now, all

1535
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,880
right, y'all might know I spent a

1536
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,199
lifetime cutting

1537
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,680
grass and letting it grow, but a lot of

1538
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,679
cutting it

1539
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:25,279
mainly. But I used to weed eat a lot. I

1540
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:28,719
used to cut a lot of grass in Kentucky.

1541
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,200
And when I got my job, my boss said to

1542
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:33,039
me at the time, he said, "When I was

1543
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,078
young, when I was young buck and my

1544
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:38,960
thing was so hard, he said, "You ever

1545
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,440
weed before?" I said, "Yes, sir, I

1546
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,798
have." He said, "Well, if you have, let

1547
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:48,240
me see you string a weed eater." So, I

1548
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:49,519
got out there 20 minutes fumbling with

1549
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:51,519
that thing. I don't know what the heck

1550
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:54,400
I'm doing. I'm nervous. I'm trying to

1551
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,280
impress him, you know? I never I don't I

1552
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:01,039
don't know what a speedfed uh weed eater

1553
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:03,839
head even was at the time. Right. So,

1554
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:06,318
I'm here today to teach you guys how to

1555
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:09,039
speed feed your weed eater head. If you

1556
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:11,119
don't got a a speed feed head on your

1557
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,719
weed eater and you got and you still got

1558
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,798
your little guard on there like a little

1559
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:18,159
[ __ ] or something wrong with you now.

1560
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:20,280
You want full RPMs. You want full

1561
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,960
agility. You want this thing to be

1562
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,280
streamlined. You want it to be light.

1563
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,920
You want it to rock out and [ __ ] strong

1564
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,319
whenever you want it to. So today I'm

1565
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,798
gonna teach y'all a little tip. No more

1566
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:34,880
laying around out in your yard playing

1567
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:38,159
with yourself in the weed of your head

1568
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,480
trying to get it strum. So this piece

1569
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,960
right here is too short. But keep in

1570
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,679
mind, the shorter your string, the

1571
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,280
higher your RPMs are going to be, which

1572
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,919
means your head's going to spin faster

1573
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,240
due to the the less weight that is on

1574
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,599
the head, which can be a good thing or a

1575
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:55,159
bad thing depending on where you're at

1576
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,160
and what you're doing. But in

1577
00:59:55,159 --> 01:00:00,000
residential, usually if I'm doing a

1578
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:01,838
residential property and and it's been

1579
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,358
weeded before or the week before,

1580
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:05,599
especially, and I just got to come in

1581
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:07,358
there and do a quick quick cut, I'm

1582
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,039
going to do a little bit of string. I'm

1583
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:10,400
going to do a a smaller string than

1584
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,400
this. This string here is going to be

1585
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,280
made more for going through big [ __ ]

1586
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,519
like brush. Right now, this kind of

1587
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,200
string comes with downside though, too.

1588
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:20,798
It's real heavy, right? So, you might

1589
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,480
need a smaller piece of it to get them

1590
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:25,039
RPMs you really looking for. You going

1591
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,280
to get tangled up, bro. There's a lot to

1592
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:29,199
weed eater science. I ain't a bro

1593
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,200
science now. I'm a weed eater scientist.

1594
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,838
So, I'm here to teach y'all something.

1595
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:36,239
You could you could resupply your head

1596
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,719
on your head your weed eater or your

1597
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:41,199
string trimmer without even taking it

1598
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:43,358
off. All right. All I want you to do is

1599
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:44,879
you get yourself a piece of string

1600
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,119
depending on how long it is. It doesn't

1601
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,680
really matter, but you can get one two

1602
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,760
or three. Back when I was out on the,

1603
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,078
you know, doing 25 miles of horse fence

1604
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,000
every day, uh, you know, I like to get

1605
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,920
me as long as pieces I can get. And your

1606
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,639
head's going to take about, uh, you

1607
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,639
know, whatever, nine yards or so. about

1608
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:04,078
basically take your arms all the way out

1609
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:05,759
and you can do that two to three times

1610
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,200
with most of these, right? You can fill

1611
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,359
them up. Like I said, it's going to be

1612
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:12,199
more weight. Keep that in mind. People

1613
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:14,798
say, "Brother, why aren't you using a

1614
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:17,399
steel or a husk of Varnner or something

1615
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:20,759
like that? Why are you using a a

1616
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:24,240
Japanese piece of equipment there, bud?"

1617
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,839
Well, this is a Shandawa. I love my

1618
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,078
Shandawa. They've been around for many

1619
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:29,759
years. I I would lift it up and show

1620
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,559
y'all, but we're gonna we're g going to

1621
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,480
break something. Uh people say, "Well,

1622
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:37,040
why don't you use something more like a

1623
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,599
steel? That things are badass, bro." You

1624
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:41,358
know, I did a lot lot of residential

1625
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,720
properties. When I'm doing residential

1626
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:44,798
properties and I'm getting in and out of

1627
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:48,239
the truck all day long, I want something

1628
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:50,679
lightweight with high RPMs that, you

1629
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:53,279
know, I'm not Listen, guys, we're

1630
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:55,358
hardcore. We don't use edggers. We don't

1631
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,079
do all We don't have multiple equipment.

1632
01:01:55,358 --> 01:02:00,798
I do all my edging, my beveling, my weed

1633
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,798
eating. Heck, I even mow yards with this

1634
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:04,159
freaking thing sometimes. I'm not even

1635
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:06,159
kidding you. There's some yards that are

1636
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,798
fencing I can't get in. I'm using a

1637
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:10,399
freaking weed eater. No push mower. No

1638
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,559
more. We ain't doing no push mowing

1639
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,480
[ __ ] [ __ ] I don't like push mowing.

1640
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,160
I'm, you know, I've push mode many years

1641
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,760
and I'm not into it. I like I'd rather

1642
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,159
take this puppy right here and just burn

1643
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,880
it down and look like glass, green

1644
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,399
glass. Buddy, smooth you ever seen. They

1645
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,920
the customer would never even know.

1646
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,000
They'd be gone all day. They say, "Your

1647
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,760
yard looks great." And I say, "Well,

1648
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,920
good. I cut it with the weed eater."

1649
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:35,839
Well, I like a Shandawa cuz a steel the

1650
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,000
same commercial grade as this version is

1651
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:40,798
about twice as heavy, right? If I'm in

1652
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,719
big brush, I'm getting me a steel. If

1653
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,639
I'm on residential, I'm going rock with

1654
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:45,919
this here. Shandawa. Now, they make

1655
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:47,440
different models and different products

1656
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,358
for each one that could you probably

1657
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,519
find a similar thing. This just happened

1658
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:53,519
to be on sale at the time. You get two

1659
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:54,880
for some price. And I've been using them

1660
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,480
for 10 plus years and they've been

1661
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,838
great, great for me. And I'm not

1662
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,760
plugging them. I'm not sponsored by

1663
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:02,000
them. But today, I just want to simply

1664
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,000
teach

1665
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:08,159
you how to string a weed

1666
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:09,679
eater without taking the head off. A lot

1667
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,039
of you guys and gals out there may not

1668
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:13,279
know this [ __ ] Here, let me turn it

1669
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:16,000
this way so you can see. So I can see.

1670
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:18,559
See these holes right here?

1671
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,039
What you want to do, look through that

1672
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:23,839
hole and if it's all lined up in there,

1673
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,359
right? After you lose a piece of string,

1674
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:26,960
you should be able to see daylight. So,

1675
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:29,119
what you want to do is take that head,

1676
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,318
that hole, a head in that hole, point it

1677
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,880
to the sky. Point it to the sun,

1678
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:34,960
brother. Look through the hole and look

1679
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,358
for the sun. Now, I don't know if this

1680
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,798
weeder set up for this. It might be. I

1681
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:42,239
had my little helper uh in here earlier

1682
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:46,079
today. Yep. And I don't know if y'all

1683
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,838
will be able to see us or not, but maybe

1684
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,680
we could do a lighter here. I want see

1685
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:51,920
if we can do it. We'll point this at the

1686
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,279
thing here so you all can see it. Now,

1687
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,000
watch. See if you see a light coming

1688
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:59,400
through there. Maybe. Nope. It ain't

1689
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,119
powerful enough. All right. The idea

1690
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:06,838
is look through the sun or a light. Take

1691
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:10,559
that string, right, and you stick it in

1692
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:12,000
there. And magic. Look at that. They

1693
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,920
call me the magic man. I'm going to

1694
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,838
teach y'all boys something today about

1695
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,760
weed eating. All right. You got her

1696
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,400
through the hole. And this ain't like

1697
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,960
high school, bro. Be you gota You got to

1698
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,358
be smart. Be

1699
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,960
gentle. Be steady, Eddie. You grab that

1700
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,480
weeder. You bring that string out just

1701
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,119
like that. Don't matter how long it is.

1702
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,559
Get it straight. Get it taut. All right.

1703
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:38,318
Once you got it there, easy peasy. Keep

1704
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:42,000
it twisted. And all you got to do is

1705
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:43,279
twisty twisty. And that's easy peasy,

1706
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,119
brothers. Look at that. Y'all didn't

1707
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,920
know that, did y'all? Taught you

1708
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:50,160
something new, didn't I? Well, we're

1709
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,760
going to improve gardens. We're going to

1710
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:53,440
improve your yard. We're going to teach

1711
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,039
you new techniques that you never even

1712
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,679
knew about. I'm going to teach you all

1713
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,760
how to wield one of these things uh

1714
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,679
better than you could ever imagine. We

1715
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,960
got edging techniques. We got all kinds

1716
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,399
of stuff coming up. And I ain't talking

1717
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,280
about these kind of edging techniques.

1718
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,160
I'm talking about making your sidewalks,

1719
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:12,160
your driveways, your pathways, any

1720
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,920
whatever your businesses, making them

1721
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,279
shine, making them look [ __ ] strong,

1722
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,798
making them look crystal clean, making

1723
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,880
them look good. That's what life's

1724
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,519
about. Get out there and work hard. Put

1725
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,400
that grind in, you know, makes make

1726
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:23,599
something out of yourself. Make

1727
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,200
something out of be proud of what you

1728
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,640
do. Be proud of where you are. Be proud

1729
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,838
of where you're from. Ain't nothing

1730
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:31,199
wrong with that, you know. But anyways,

1731
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:34,078
I'm going to jump into a quick story

1732
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,798
before we wrap up here.

1733
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:40,000
I do appreciate y'all tuning in. Means a

1734
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:42,880
lot to me. I meant to have me a little

1735
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,119
campfire going on on over here, but any

1736
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,960
we'll f with that next time. I'm working

1737
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,519
on the background, you guys. We're gonna

1738
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,400
get this [ __ ] going, right? We going to

1739
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:53,920
get there. But today, I just had the one

1740
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,440
story for y'all. I got to save some of

1741
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,039
these because we'll run out of them

1742
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,720
eventually.

1743
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:02,960
But let's just say this girl's name was

1744
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,159
Nova.

1745
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:09,519
I was 24,

1746
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:11,519
25. I just got kicked out of a supposed

1747
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:14,318
friend's house. Literally knocked on my

1748
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:16,480
door one morning and said, "Bro, like

1749
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,079
the landlord never knew you were here.

1750
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,760
He never knew your girlfriend was here.

1751
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,920
I was living with her. I was living with

1752
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,400
Nova at this this dude's house that was

1753
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,400
supposedly my buddy. Uh, you know, kind

1754
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,318
of a weird situation. I was selling weed

1755
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,920
to him. I was selling weed to a lot of

1756
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,480
his friends. We got more stories with

1757
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,318
this dude and stuff coming up, but just

1758
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,679
for the sake of like setting the tone

1759
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,798
for you guys. I was dating this girl

1760
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:40,879
named Nova. We was living at this house.

1761
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:42,000
She's a mixed girl. She was not that has

1762
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,440
anything to do with it, but I'm just

1763
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,199
trying to, like I said, set the tone.

1764
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,720
She was fine, brothers. I mean, she

1765
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,639
didn't have big calcium cannons like

1766
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:53,679
your boy likes, but she was fine. She

1767
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:58,000
was fine. Uh, anyways, beautiful. Uh, so

1768
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:58,000
we get kicked out of this place

1769
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:03,679
and well, let me backtrack. We're living

1770
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,440
at this place for over I think almost

1771
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,598
two years, a year, whatever. I'm

1772
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,200
trapping. I'm doing my [ __ ] A lot of

1773
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,359
stuff went down there. We'll get into it

1774
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:13,318
another time. I get a knock one morning

1775
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:15,639
on a Saturday,

1776
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:18,880
November. Hey,

1777
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:22,000
Chucky, can I talk to you for a second?

1778
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,760
Yeah, what's up, bro?

1779
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,719
our landlord's on the way over here with

1780
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,400
the sheriff in the next few days and we

1781
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,000
got to get out of here. He said he

1782
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,798
didn't know that you guys weren't on the

1783
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,719
lease or or all this and you gota you

1784
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:36,400
got to go, bro. And we're actually not

1785
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,719
paying rent this month and we're leaving

1786
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,599
as well today. I was like, "What do you

1787
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:41,759
mean you're leaving today?" He's like,

1788
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,960
"I got a U-Haul truck." I was like,

1789
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,240
"What the hell?" So this dude and his

1790
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,240
girlfriend that were supposedly my

1791
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:50,479
friends dipped out on us literally that

1792
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:53,519
day. They're packing their [ __ ] up. So,

1793
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,679
I get all my stuff in the truck that I

1794
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:57,838
can get that I can fit. I get me and

1795
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:00,719
her, we get in there and we go and stay

1796
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:03,920
at mom's crib for a little while and I'm

1797
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:06,000
working on getting a place and I'm

1798
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,400
trapping out mom's crib trying to make

1799
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,239
it work. I mean, you know, just a [ __ ]

1800
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,000
up situation. I'm embarrassed. I got my

1801
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:14,879
old lady with me in my mom's house. It's

1802
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,039
embarrassing as [ __ ] right? But we

1803
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,920
making it [ __ ] work. Chuck Dog will find

1804
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,759
a way. I'm not a quitter, bro. I'll find

1805
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,719
a way. And uh

1806
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:26,719
so I'm about to sneeze. Hold

1807
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:34,519
on. All right. So I'm living there two

1808
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:37,198
or three months trapping. Shit's

1809
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:39,319
awkward. You know, mom's seeing my balls

1810
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:44,238
sometimes cuz she don't there's one

1811
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:46,560
bathroom, whatever. Uh so we finally get

1812
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:49,278
this. We look all over the place, bro,

1813
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,120
for an apartment, for a somewhere to

1814
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,880
stay. We got to get out of mom's crib

1815
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,399
because I'm losing money because I can't

1816
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,000
run them through like I usually do

1817
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,759
because the

1818
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,798
situation traffic. Can't have too much

1819
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:05,920
traffic. So, we're looking for a place

1820
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:07,838
to stay and it's hard because I ain't

1821
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,960
got a real job and they want to know

1822
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:14,960
where you work. So, that shit's hard.

1823
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,960
Uh,

1824
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:21,358
so we finally get this lady, this old

1825
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,759
lady that lets us go check out this

1826
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,000
duplex. We get this duplex, right? And

1827
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,079
I'm trapping it out, bro. We get this

1828
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,679
duplex. It's [ __ ] bro. There was like,

1829
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,559
come to find out, there's bed bugs in

1830
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:35,600
there, roaches in there, fam. I mean, I

1831
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,759
was I was never alone. There was never a

1832
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,679
moment I was alone.

1833
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,520
There's

1834
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:43,199
roaches, bed

1835
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:45,359
bugs. My neighbor was always knocking on

1836
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:50,039
on the [ __ ] door asking for a square.

1837
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:52,159
[ __ ] like that. Can he bump some water?

1838
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:53,679
Anyways, we're living in this place

1839
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:56,079
getting it sorted out. I'm trapping,

1840
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,319
bro. Middle of the summer. Everything's

1841
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:00,319
looking good. Got me a nice little stack

1842
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:04,119
stacked up in the closet, you know,

1843
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:08,559
stuff like that. We're smoking a blunt

1844
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:11,279
and we got the windows open, bro.

1845
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,440
Got the music on. I'm thinking about

1846
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:16,519
getting some

1847
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:20,158
nookie. Got the Oreo cookies out the

1848
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:21,400
milk. Looking for them calcium cannons,

1849
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,879
bro.

1850
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:27,198
But I'm sitting there,

1851
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,640
bro, and we that duplex was set up

1852
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:30,238
weird, but like basically our living

1853
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,320
room was our bedroom type [ __ ] It was

1854
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:35,919
weird. And there's a a window at ground

1855
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:39,039
level that faced my neighbor's house

1856
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,319
that was about 10 feet 10 foot away.

1857
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:43,039
This is one of the moments I didn't live

1858
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,479
in the country, bro. Couldn't find

1859
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:46,158
nothing in the country at the time. It's

1860
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,718
hard to find a place sometimes,

1861
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,238
especially during that

1862
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:52,800
time.

1863
01:10:49,238 --> 01:10:54,799
Uh but so I'm looking out the window for

1864
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:59,719
a second, kind of chilling. We got music

1865
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:02,960
on like I said and bro, three state

1866
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:04,480
troopers like walk right right there and

1867
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,158
just stop right there, bro. And are

1868
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:09,678
looking around and look over my house

1869
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:12,319
and [ __ ] bro. And I froze. My heart

1870
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,000
jumped cuz dude, I just re up. Me and

1871
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:16,079
her in there bopping, having a good time

1872
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,119
because we got just got some new weed.

1873
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,960
I'm blazing. We got the window AC units

1874
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:23,198
and the windows open, pumping,

1875
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,039
everything. So it's no no smell

1876
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:28,799
protection, right? This is back still

1877
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:30,079
when dealing and uh you know you defin I

1878
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,920
mean it's still bad, bro. You don't want

1879
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:33,920
to get caught dealing ever. Don't deal

1880
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,880
guys. Stay in school. I don't deal no

1881
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,079
more. But my point

1882
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:44,079
is at the time it wasn't very like the

1883
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:46,079
climate was still pretty sketch. So, I'm

1884
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,640
a little paranoid at this point and [ __ ]

1885
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:50,960
my pants basically cuz they're sitting

1886
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,760
there and bro I go to the front of the

1887
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:56,000
duplex which is this duplex was in I had

1888
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,239
a front street and a back street and

1889
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,079
there's a train tracks on the back

1890
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:03,359
street next to the back road as well was

1891
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:06,960
like a dirt road on there and I look out

1892
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:10,238
front bro and there's a armada bro a

1893
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,000
army of police around our whole duplex

1894
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:17,198
dude I'm talking state police, sheriffs,

1895
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,439
like everything, bro. And I told her, I

1896
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:26,238
was like, "Damn, dude. We're

1897
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:28,158
fucked." So, man, I take the money and I

1898
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:31,119
[ __ ] throw that [ __ ] up in the

1899
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:32,319
[ __ ] attic as far as I can. At that

1900
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:33,760
point, like, I'm thinking like, I'm

1901
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,840
[ __ ] no matter what, dude. This little

1902
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,920
big place still going to find whatever.

1903
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:41,360
And

1904
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:43,440
uh I took uh all the weed. I told her,

1905
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:44,639
"Go to the bathroom, bro." Like what she

1906
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:46,960
was talking about on the last story. Go

1907
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,920
to the bathroom. Get ready to flush all

1908
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,760
that [ __ ] She's like, "Oh god, we'll be

1909
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,158
all right. We'll be all right. Chuck

1910
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,480
dog. Chuck dog, calm down." I said, "We

1911
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:58,198
ain't going to jail, baby." I said, "We

1912
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:01,799
ain't going to

1913
01:12:58,198 --> 01:13:04,079
jail. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not

1914
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,239
never." Said, "It ain't We ain't going

1915
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,079
down like that." I said, "I'll flush my

1916
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:11,198
[ __ ] I'll hustle back up. I don't give

1917
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:14,319
a [ __ ] bro. We ain't going to jail. We

1918
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:17,158
gonna stay out safe and and and sound,

1919
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:20,799
bro. Right. So, she's in there with the

1920
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:22,359
[ __ ] And uh man, I dropped my stuff,

1921
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,360
bro. I got to get my

1922
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:27,079
equipment. Keith got me Keith got me

1923
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:29,880
tripping,

1924
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:32,800
bro. So, I'm sitting there,

1925
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:34,319
bro. House around. I go to the back. I

1926
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,760
look out the bathroom window. The

1927
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:36,960
bathroom set off the back of the house

1928
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,440
facing the back row where the train

1929
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,198
tracks was. And there's like [ __ ]

1930
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:43,359
eight state troopers walking like arm

1931
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:45,119
in- arm type [ __ ] close enough like

1932
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:46,479
they're on the back side of the road.

1933
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,519
There's cops everywhere. They're talking

1934
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:51,198
to my neighbors, bro. Like, oh my god.

1935
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,560
Uh, you know, I wasn't growing at the

1936
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:56,678
time. I was just dealing. But, um, I was

1937
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,039
still like, [ __ ] I'm in like a small

1938
01:13:56,679 --> 01:14:02,319
town. I don't know. I just saw I was

1939
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:04,719
tripping, right? And, uh, I see him

1940
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,319
talking to my neighbor and I was like,

1941
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,840
what the hell? Why would they just be

1942
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:09,119
talking to my neighbor, bro? They be

1943
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:13,600
over here [ __ ] with me. I'm all

1944
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:15,920
paranoid, right? And uh cuz I mean your

1945
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,760
boy had crazy ex-girlfriends at the time

1946
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,279
that that's trying to cause me problems.

1947
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,600
Their moms were trying to cause me

1948
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:23,679
problems. Like I just had a lot of a lot

1949
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,320
of enemies, rival crews that didn't [ __ ]

1950
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,000
with me. I mean, the chick I was with, I

1951
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:29,840
had stolen her away from some other

1952
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,640
dude. You know, you know how the dab

1953
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,920
hoes are. They just in it for the weed.

1954
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,320
You should leave them up on the

1955
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,480
mountain. uh you know, give them their

1956
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:39,679
paycheck and and let it be. You know,

1957
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:42,079
you don't need to make love to your

1958
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,920
trim, girl. But I was I me and her,

1959
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:46,800
Bonnie and Clyde, bro. We in there

1960
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,840
making love, flipping packs, you know.

1961
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,600
She was doing runs, I was doing runs. Uh

1962
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,560
you

1963
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:58,719
know, just making it work, bro. No jobs,

1964
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,880
making it work. And uh I mean her I was

1965
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:02,239
sitting here thinking like, "This shit's

1966
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,440
over." Well, I call my neighbor right

1967
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:05,119
after he gets done talking to one of the

1968
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:08,279
state troopers. I was like, "What the

1969
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:10,880
hell's going on, bro?" And he's like,

1970
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:13,759
"Well, some guy stole a bunch of money

1971
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,840
from the bank on a motorcycle and flew

1972
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,039
down the back road here and crashed back

1973
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,039
there. They're looking for

1974
01:15:19,158 --> 01:15:26,319
him." I'm like, "Damn, bro." Another

1975
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:28,239
close call. [ __ ] my pants, you know. And

1976
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,238
uh he's like, "Yeah." Uh I was like,

1977
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:32,479
"What?" He's like, "Yeah, man. He came

1978
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:34,000
ripping down through here and and like

1979
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,319
60 mph and crashed back there.

1980
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,279
Supposedly they found his bike. Well,

1981
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,279
I'm sitting there,

1982
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:44,079
bro. And I look out the window while I'm

1983
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,679
talking to him and the cops are like

1984
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:46,800
behind the dumpster like looking at my

1985
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,399
house and [ __ ] They're looking

1986
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:53,480
underneath my car and I'm like, "Oh,

1987
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:56,399
okay." And uh and I keep weed in my car,

1988
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:58,718
right? Uh I at the time I'd keep some

1989
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:00,479
weed in there cuz not the I had two

1990
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,359
cars. One car I keep weed in, the other

1991
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:04,198
one I do like my deliveries and [ __ ]

1992
01:16:02,359 --> 01:16:07,119
in.

1993
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:09,599
And I keep roaches, like blunt roaches

1994
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:11,039
in there, stunk, you know, and I could

1995
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,800
just see them over like looking in the

1996
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:14,079
car. They didn't go in, but my windows

1997
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,760
were down and [ __ ] They could they were

1998
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:17,519
there looking and like pointing at [ __ ]

1999
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,360
and all that. But they didn't [ __ ] with

2000
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,120
me, bro. But I sit there sweating like,

2001
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:23,439
"Damn, dude. Like, leave just leave me

2002
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,880
alone. Don't need this attention." And

2003
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:26,719
then like five minutes later, they bring

2004
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,960
this dude up in the in the car. drives

2005
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,560
by from out in the back alley and they

2006
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,960
captured this dude or whatever and they

2007
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:37,199
all just kind of left, bro. But

2008
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:40,880
man, my butthole was like that big the

2009
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:42,879
whole time, dude. [ __ ] my pants. So, I

2010
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,960
don't know. Not that exciting of a

2011
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,640
story, but it was a close call. Maybe

2012
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:51,119
you guys can relate to that [ __ ] in the

2013
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:52,800
comments. being high off your ass and

2014
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:55,198
then being so paranoid when that [ __ ]

2015
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,119
happens that you're like about to do

2016
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:58,879
some dumb [ __ ] like flush all your weed

2017
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:00,158
or maybe y'all can relate. Maybe you

2018
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,199
throw it up in the comments. Let me know

2019
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,279
if you could share if you can't.

2020
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:05,678
Whatever. Whatever. You know, Keith

2021
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:08,319
showed it was good. I'm feeling pretty

2022
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:10,480
buzzed. I can barely feel my lips. It's

2023
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:12,238
been hard to communicate, but I'm

2024
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:13,599
feeling good. I'm rolling this up just

2025
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,599
fine. I feel like we're doing did all

2026
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,280
right with the solo episode. You know,

2027
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,560
these are a little awkward. The solo

2028
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:19,840
episodes can be a little awkward, you

2029
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,880
know, because you're talking to yourself

2030
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:25,279
essentially. But if y'all don't mind

2031
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,359
them, I don't mind them. So, let me know

in the comments section what you think.

2033
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:34,399
Think I did a okay job. I know we didn't

2034
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,920
go super deep into detail, but I think

2035
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,158
that'd be a little overhead over

2036
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,560
people's heads and frankly over my heads

2037
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,238
half the time. So, you know, get you

2038
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,400
guys some good nutrients. Get you guys

2039
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:46,000
