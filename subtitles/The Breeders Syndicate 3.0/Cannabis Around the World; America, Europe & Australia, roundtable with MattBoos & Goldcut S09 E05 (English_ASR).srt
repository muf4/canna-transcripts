00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,519
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,100

00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,280

those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,140

hey guys yeah hello guys

40
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,599
um I thought we would warm up by just

41
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,280
going around and saying like how long

42
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,259
have you been growing slash involved

43
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,799
with the plant and what have you liked

44
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,180
growing or smoking recently maybe booze

45
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,939
you start

46
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,240
yeah sure man so hey guys

47
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:48,478
um yeah I've been growing since

48
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:50,640
2015 now so I started smoking uh 2011

49
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,959
just normal [ __ ] at school everyone was

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,000
smoking

51
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,259
um it's pretty common over here I think

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,060
like

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,978
um most people at school generally like

54
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,500
grade 11 12 would start smoking I think

55
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:04,078
it's more common than not and um yeah

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,060
from that on man got into it uh from a

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,618
more sort of advanced level started

58
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,439
getting into the genetics and stuff like

59
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,120
prior to that uh the scene over here you

60
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,979
could only really get one type of

61
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,539
cannabis so that was obviously Bush and

62
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,560
stuff if you knew someone but for the

63
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:21,359
most part it's been uh sort of like gang

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
run for a long time it's just the same

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,340
sort of [ __ ] it's like compact pgr stuff

66
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,439
that everyone was getting so prior to

67
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,000
getting exposure to cannabis that was

68
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,459
sort of my only real knowledge of it but

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,419
then when I was uh 17 I went over to

70
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,759
Europe

71
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,679
and uh spent some time in Switzerland

72
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,539
for sort of 12 months living over there

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
and then I started to see what cannabis

74
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,378
could really be like sort of a lot of

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,239
stuff from Amsterdam and and that and um

76
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:47,280
yeah sort of when I came home it was

77
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,680
back to the old [ __ ] again the old

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
compact PGI and um yeah just started

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,739
growing after that I thought you know

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
this is going to be better than this and

81
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,500
if I can't get it I'll just do it myself

82
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,619
I've only recently seen what

83
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,479
um you're referring to as compact pgr

84
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,980
like pictures of it I think he sent them

85
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,979
to me or someone did thousand people

86
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,539
sent me something it was yeah I was

87
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,679
surprised I was surprised because I

88
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,318
thought like I mean I'm used to

89
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,879
California bad but it's it's comparable

90
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:19,139
I think yeah I'm gonna I think uh booze

91
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,518
and I will have a little exchange about

92
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,639
that later on

93
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,700
um yeah we talk about the flower uh

94
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,439
locally available it's not it's not much

95
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,658
different actually than our Mexican for

96
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,739
here like for Americans or if you were

97
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:34,620
in California growing up or Mexican

98
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,658
brick I think it would be akin to that

99
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,920
maybe for you guys but yeah we'll talk

100
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,919
about it a bit

101
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,500
maybe yeah I I don't know man like this

102
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,359
stuff is something else okay wait it was

103
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,919
before before we moved to Gold cut um

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,299
what have you liked growing and smoking

105
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,759
recently

106
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,739
oh since coming into The Syndicate I've

107
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,179
obviously gotten a lot of extra gear and

108
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,980
prior to that it was just like finding

109
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,900
random breeders on Instagram and it's

110
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,759
really hard to get seized into Australia

111
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,219
unless you're trying to get through like

112
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,899
[ __ ] I love growing marijuana or

113
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,340
seeds man or something like that which

114
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,560
is you know it's going to be a lot of

115
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,819
generic like hit and miss [ __ ]

116
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,979
um but yeah man it's still coming into

117
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,679
The Syndicate I've grown a bunch of just

118
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,719
done some blue TK from Matt that I've

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,579
been smoking on this morning what else a

120
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,319
bit of uh some outdoor [ __ ] too I'm

121
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:24,060
doing some sativa stuff now I've got

122
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,800
some uh A5 Haze BC from Lush and um

123
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,399
planning on doing a big run of them in

124
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,740
the greenhouse this summer so yeah

125
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,659
stuff too yeah yeah man yeah we'll see

126
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,939
Wally's stuff I got a bunch of so I'm

127
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,199
waiting like It's tricky because like we

128
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,819
were talking about I want to really get

129
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,560
into the growing plants outdoors and

130
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,360
doing some breeding for outdoors similar

131
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,600
to what Wally's done so some of the [ __ ]

132
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,840
like the I got C5 mango uh mango Haze

133
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
IBL but I got like 40 50 of each so I'm

134
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,899
sort of waiting I want to pop them all

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,280
at once and have a look at that stuff so

136
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,279
I'll put that on the back burner for a

137
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,079
little while shout out Wally duck [ __ ]

138
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,779
yeah man well he's a legend really nice

139
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,120
guy

140
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,319
thanks for that booze yeah gold cut you

141
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
know how long have you been involved

142
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,519
with the plant how did you get involved

143
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
with the plant and all and then

144
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,859
secondarily uh what have you been

145
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,639
enjoying growing and or smoking recently

146
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,620
so I think it started getting involved

147
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,259
with the plant in general I'm a gardener

148
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,478
so I have a Gardener's a little

149
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,319
Gardener's bread bishop and master's

150
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,839
degree

151
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,719
and during that time I already got in

152
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:34,918
contact but I think uh really what

153
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,500
really made me uh start to cultivate was

154
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,319
we didn't want to buy hash from the hash

155
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,379
bars the the Shady hash bars again

156
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,360
anymore and so that was kind of I think

157
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,538
that was kind of the motivation because

158
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,340
we all found out through a bunch of guys

159
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,038
in Vienna found out through High Times

160
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,258
magazines that there are seeds and that

161
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,478
you can cultivate at home and stuff like

162
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,939
that and I think that's how we how we

163
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,620
got the got started and I collected

164
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,680
backseat

165
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,720
so very early on I collated bag seeds

166
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,220
and I started doors at one point with my

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,860
mom's place and had

168
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,960
a bunch of plans and that from there on

169
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,000
I think I never I never stopped

170
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,180
cultivating

171
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,740
no and uh

172
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:25,019
um what I recently did and liked was

173
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,019
most of the Cami stuff that we have here

174
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:29,879
I do like that stuff a lot

175
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,579
when did you start seeing the chemistuff

176
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:36,240
show up like legit Cami stuff

177
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:40,019
when we my team brought it exactly I

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,240
mean it kind of Fairly it happened long

179
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,579
after it was here right like you had to

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
really work to get it there yeah yeah I

181
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:49,859
think that most of the the

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,418
representations of whatever you they

183
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,879
call Cam

184
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:57,060
is what you often talked about you know

185
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,079
it is Southern Southern uh illusion or

186
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,418
uh

187
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,839
A desperate wish you know to have

188
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:06,538
something authentic and it's all most of

189
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,879
it is crap but I think through a bunch

190
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:10,860
of uh

191
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,620
breeder from abroad

192
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,759
it's now possible for for everybody to

193
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,720
enjoy

194
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:22,379
a good camp Cross or just uh you know

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,180
candy or whatever you choose

196
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,038
exactly

197
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,319
yeah it's much more available now

198
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,659
through repeatable people back in the

199
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,098
day you're right it was it was so hit or

200
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,599
miss I mean I was talking to someone

201
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,120
earlier

202
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,918
um about an old cut that I was one of

203
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,560
the last people to have and watched you

204
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,659
die and they're pretty sure that they

205
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,060
have this cut right

206
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,340
but they've never smoked it they don't

207
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,079
know the person they got it from never

208
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,399
smoked it never been around for it it's

209
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,500
a brand new person

210
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,538
and they sourced it from this person but

211
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,399
they said they were waiting to smoke it

212
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,199
to see if it's real and at that point I

213
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,120
was kind of like but is that going to

214
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,080
answer your questions on whether shit's

215
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,079
real or not so you know

216
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:10,978
I think it's interesting that uh a lot

217
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:14,279
many years later we uh we here find out

218
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:17,459
that super skunk was something came here

219
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:21,059
something you know in this direction yep

220
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:24,719
yep a lot many years later so people

221
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,780
kind of I think they got it on you know

222
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,400
mixed up with with other skunks that are

223
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,699
far from

224
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:35,399
from this direction from

225
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,320
isn't it like realistically like we were

226
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,479
trying to convince you guys to buy

227
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,219
something that was probably already over

228
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,580
there in a similar fashion just with a

229
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,580
different name

230
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,899
was popular

231
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,519
yeah

232
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,740
for a long time for a very long time

233
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,519
yeah and Shiva for those listening it

234
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,590

235
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,590

thank you both for uh yeah getting us

237
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,320

and so yeah today's episode really all

239
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,339
we're doing is we're gonna go through

240
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,260
some of the you know basic things like

241
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,899
you know what sort of flowers available

242
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,179
where you are what kinds of scenes you

243
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,399
know historically

244
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,439
um what's the culture been like legality

245
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,000
so we'll run through some of these basic

246
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,940
questions and

247
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,220
um I would also like to preface for

248
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,320
everyone that of course not a single one

249
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,420
of us can perfectly represent where we

250
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,500
come from or like be a perfect Authority

251
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:45,500
speak for yourself

252
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,860
absolute knowledge of everything

253
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,860
American

254
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,419
so we're just trying to give like our

255
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,419
perspective you know anecdotes from what

256
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,919
we know how we're fragmentary and um

257
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,838
yeah we just hope they'll be an

258
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,120
interesting conversation and maybe we'll

259
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,519
learn some things about different places

260
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,379
and how they've approached the plant

261
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:15,839
yeah so yeah in saying that as we as we

262
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,820
all know America's always going to be

263
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,399
the like point of reference so we can

264
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,440
grow Matt whenever slash make fun of

265
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
America

266
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,700
and yeah don't hesitate to ask each

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,659
other like questions as we go along for

268
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,879
sure

269
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:32,039
so the first I think the first topic

270
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,679
that I wanted to get to was just just

271
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,259
legal status you know where is your

272
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:40,919
country's last region

273
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:44,278
um in terms of legality right now

274
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:46,740
um booze maybe we start with you

275
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,778
Yeah man so uh We've currently got a

276
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,440
model of medical legalization happening

277
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:56,159
it's been happening since

278
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,480
2017 or 18. uh I had a a acquaintance

279
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,639
whatever who was like one of the first

280
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,620
patients in Australia and he uh he had a

281
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,078
brain tumor and so that was the type of

282
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,639
condition that you had to have uh to get

283
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,199
into the medical registrar to begin with

284
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,179
and it was extremely expensive as well

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,560
man it was like a thousand bucks an

286
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,379
ounce and it was you know all Canadian

287
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,479
[ __ ] anyway but uh now we're at a model

288
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:17,578
where uh people are cultivating so

289
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,180
there's cultivation licenses

290
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,399
um

291
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,899
I haven't seen any of it like any of the

292
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,179
Australian stuff the only [ __ ] I've seen

293
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,620
like I'm not on the medical or anything

294
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,659
um the only [ __ ] I've seen is the

295
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,940
Canadian and it's all like it's actually

296
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,799
reminiscent of that [ __ ] that I saw in

297
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,959
my youth man a little bit like not in

298
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,939
terms of like you know I don't have to

299
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,859
pgr or whatever but some compact [ __ ]

300
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,420
like it's over dried it doesn't have a

301
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,659
lot of smell I hear a lot of it's

302
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:45,179
irradiated as well so there is obviously

303
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:47,399
products but you know it's far from good

304
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,500
in my opinion at the moment

305
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,659
um but yeah aside from that you know

306
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,600
there's oh it's been decriminalized to

307
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:56,458
grow two plants in the act so it's uh

308
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,540
down in Canberra just [ __ ] weird

309
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,399
because it's where like all the

310
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:00,659
politicians are so it's like this tiny

311
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,700
little State I guess similar to like

312
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,740
Washington DC you know and that's that's

313
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,180
the one place they've uh they've voted

314
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,399
that you can grow so that's that's a

315
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:10,699
trip that's bizarre yeah yeah that's the

316
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,078
trip but uh

317
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,160
yeah I think so man that's well that's

318
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,838
sort of it at the moment like the

319
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,578
medical license I was speaking to a guy

320
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,680
about this recently it has sort of been

321
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:21,659
geared towards same as everywhere else

322
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,958
it's like yeah you know even a research

323
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,958
license

324
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:29,578
yeah that's it so it's sort of been you

325
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,800
know taking the keys to the kingdom type

326
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:33,120
[ __ ] so I have uh yeah I've I've

327
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,099
been a bit pessimistic about the whole

328
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
thing but in terms of actual like

329
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,019
legality like getting busted and stuff

330
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,160
it's pretty tame here like unless you've

331
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,139
yeah I know people that have been done

332
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,000
with you know upwards of 100 plants and

333
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,278
have just gotten fine slap on the wrist

334
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,839
stuff like that so it's nothing major so

335
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,120
it's pretty conducive growing

336
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,500
environment obviously the outdoor

337
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,179
environment as well and everything like

338
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,700
that it's pretty [ __ ] conducive to

339
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,679
growing cannabis Down Under And um yeah

340
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,480
I'm seeing a lot more of it now I I

341
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,039
didn't know any Growers like my my

342
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,778
[ __ ] dream when I was young was like

343
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,219
man I seem to find like one of these old

344
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:06,659
hippies they're talking about and just

345
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,399
get weed from him you know what I mean

346
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,860
like where's these old dudes with the

347
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,899
bushes out the back but yeah so we're

348
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,639
back in the day yeah didn't know a lot

349
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,339
of girls but now it seems just everyone

350
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,639
and their mum's cultivating man so yeah

351
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:23,940
an overgrow type model I think

352
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,940
okay well yeah I'm I'm jealous you know

353
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,100
New Zealand is definitely not quite at

354
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,040
the same point there's no degree of

355
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,600
decriminalization anywhere yet we do

356
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:38,219
have a

357
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,120
fairly fledgling medical scene

358
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,660
um

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,578
but yeah in terms of like cultivation I

360
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:47,159
can only assume that there are a whole

361
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:49,559
lot of growers in this country I don't

362
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,299
actually know that for sure

363
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,759
um one of the relevant historical point

364
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,139
is that we did have a referendum

365
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,778
um on

366
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,700
uh decriminalization

367
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:02,820
um a few years ago and sadly it did not

368
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,019
go through narrowly but as you know as

369
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,560
you know this

370
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:11,220
um which was heartbreaking very tragic

371
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,899
um uh and other than that similar to

372
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,579
what you said Bruce at least in terms of

373
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,639
what I've found

374
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:19,919
uh enforcement

375
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,560
I would say they're generally pretty

376
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,778
tolerant towards like consumers and

377
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,819
small Growers

378
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:28,019
um yeah it's I think it's very rare to

379
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,300
see

380
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:33,600
anyone on that end of things get

381
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:35,099
properly prosecuted but uh definitely if

382
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,320
you make it their problem they will

383
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,759
still do something like if you fill a

384
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,800
house full of plants and people will not

385
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,819
can see it or smell it like you're still

386
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,740
gonna get

387
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,079
something

388
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,399
um

389
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,620
oh sorry

390
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,600
yeah I think it's a

391
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,899
it's definitely a regional thing like

392
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,720
the country is a thin strip of land that

393
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:00,120
kind of goes north to south so you do

394
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,680
get a few different climates uh down the

395
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,720
length of it

396
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,399
um and I imagine summer I imagine

397
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,160
further up north would be a lot better

398
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,100
than uh down south towards the South

399
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,419
Pole yeah and I'll definitely be around

400
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,579
some [ __ ] root around or something

401
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,439
but yeah I had a buddy

402
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,359
um it's just you know obviously like the

403
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,399
land of the long green Cloud connotation

404
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,259
but I had a body that lived in the north

405
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,179
island and she had you know uncles and

406
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,799
stuff who would head into the hills on

407
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,419
quad bikes and come back with garbage

408
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,278
bags and [ __ ] like that so I wondered if

409
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,198
that was that it ever made its way sort

410
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,059
of down to where you are but

411
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,099
yeah I imagine they're parts of the

412
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:38,039
country which are like I don't know

413
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,659
maybe like California or like Colorado

414
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,338
um climate wise I'm just guessing I

415
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,198
don't actually know this

416
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,420
um but I think I think there are some

417
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,958
really good spots

418
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,759
but yeah I mean implicitly I will uh

419
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,379
uh we didn't include New Zealand in this

420
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,939
in the title of the episode but I will

421
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,379
speak to it whenever I can I don't have

422
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,260
any links to the traditional Market

423
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:00,320
really so yeah

424
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,939
um gold cut

425
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,800
legality in Austria and maybe I don't

426
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,899
know if you want to speak for Europe as

427
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,359
well maybe in a little bit broad stroke

428
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,320
it a little bit

429
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,220
well

430
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,040
uh Austria is a weird example amongst

431
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,278
the European countries because uh here

432
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,500
you can buy seeds and plants you can buy

433
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,500
grow equipment in

434
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,299
a lot of Grow shops

435
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,419
for the size of our country I think it's

436
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:32,519
quite uh a quite big

437
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,679
in comparison to other countries are

438
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,899
around us but uh

439
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,359
with the legality

440
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,879
um for instance we can produce plants

441
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,560
and settlements

442
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,620
ornamental plants more or less okay you

443
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,899
have to you have to inform your

444
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,259
customers that those plans should not be

445
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,720
used for you know potential uh illegal

446
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:58,379
drug production or sales of any types of

447
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,759
things you know that are not legally

448
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:05,338
um so but when it comes to now there's a

449
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,539
lot of cultivation going on in Austria a

450
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:09,298
lot

451
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:11,699
and from everything from the home grower

452
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,879
with attend in his apartment

453
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,640
uh to

454
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,480
very big facilities run by

455
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:25,919
you know guys yeah yeah organizations or

456
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,980
guys yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh

457
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,500
I think that what what the ocean

458
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,558
especially the police still wants is to

459
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,960
make money with putting you over

460
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:41,240
[ __ ] with your driver's license yeah

461
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,240
yeah sending you to peace tests

462
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,820
yeah you have to you have to give a

463
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:51,960
urine test I had I got busted with 0.2

464
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:55,619
grams 20 years ago or 25 years ago yeah

465
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,980
and I had to give peace test every three

466
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:01,500
months every free month every three

467
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,700
months for three years Oh I thought you

468
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,839
meant like they could pull you over on

469
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,840
the side of the road and make you piss

470
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,939
right there I was like what now they get

471
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,220
you to the police office and and

472
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,740
MetroPCS there yeah well that's kind of

473
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,279
luxury every three months for three

474
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,740
years that's yeah yeah but it changed

475
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,359
it's diff it's different now there was

476
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:26,480
25 years ago

477
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,479
I think it's even even even worse now

478
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:33,119
so the legality is you know

479
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:36,119
it really depends in the city I would

480
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:39,178
say for me in Vienna it's it's pretty

481
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:42,000
cool you smell weed everywhere you know

482
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:45,419
but on the countryside it's a whole

483
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,359
different story yeah there's barely any

484
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,860
no there's no exact acceptance on the

485
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,819
countryside

486
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:56,099
for you know drug that people

487
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm from the from the city

488
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,359
um

489
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,940
how there's there is Medical but as as

490
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:05,939
far as I know and don't quote me on that

491
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,340
you only there's only a chance for you

492
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:12,179
to get into a medical program where you

493
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:14,459
get thrown up in all uh if if everything

494
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,660
else failed all the other therapies

495
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,759
failed

496
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,058
then you have the right and even daddy

497
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:23,940
think is pretty difficult

498
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:27,720
um there is or there is an Austrian

499
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,880
State state-funded cannabis production

500
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,480
but they sell all the products to

501
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,520
Germany to make thrown up in all so yeah

502
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,519
it's a big question mark

503
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,019
foreign I do want to add here that in

504
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,819
terms of accessing Medical in New

505
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,019
Zealand it's actually relatively easy

506
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,298
now

507
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,500
um so I would say that there are few

508
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:51,058
barriers

509
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,558
um to getting access to Medical Beyond

510
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:56,819
uh it costing a lot it's expensive

511
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,639
um

512
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,259
yeah gold cut I mean in uh in terms of

513
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,600
like

514
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,579
the countries around you what's going on

515
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,980
with like Germany I've heard some things

516
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,779
about Germany possibly opening up is

517
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,179
that a thing and and do you think

518
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:15,298
that'll affect Where You Are

519
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:18,538
oh yeah for sure if it definitely affect

520
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,519
every I think every surrounding country

521
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:22,859
all the neighboring countries of Germany

522
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,259
will be affected by it because

523
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:27,599
I mean people would say hey we want that

524
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:30,660
too without knowing what it means to

525
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,980
have uh new regulations and

526
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:37,980
seeing what unfolds there is like

527
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:42,000
everybody was so enthusiastic yeah full

528
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,860
of legal cannabis let's go and now

529
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,099
they're like [ __ ]

530
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:49,558
you can have collabs but they cannot

531
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:51,379
there's no social consuming

532
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:55,440
yeah

533
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:58,799
everything has a thousand questions that

534
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,380
even the guys who made the laws cannot

535
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,019
answer if you ask me so

536
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:08,000
but look at Germany man that's a huge

537
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:10,918
[ __ ] country with a lot of people so

538
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,419
I don't know it's gonna be very

539
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,340
interesting in the next

540
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,380
two to five years

541
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,939
to see where Germany is heading I mean

542
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,640
it's my neighboring country I speak

543
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,759
German you can understand there's a is a

544
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,780
big clone producer for many years

545
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,740
uh yeah I do look at Germany and think

546
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,558
oh

547
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,480
imagine having a couple companies there

548
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,819
producing for the German Market that

549
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,558
would be [ __ ] amazing

550
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,178
yeah I think that would have big

551
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:40,940
consequences for

552
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:45,600
everyone

553
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:48,779
already made me laugh was the Austrian

554
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,279
bought the police to Germany to Bavaria

555
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:51,779
is

556
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,418
uh

557
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:56,460
uh ringing the alarms they need more

558
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:00,179
people because there's gonna be a bunch

559
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,880
of smuggling and from from Bavaria which

560
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,820
is even

561
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,679
it's so so so strict against cannabis

562
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:11,038
that I don't even think they will have

563
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,460
clubs there I mean but the Austria is

564
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,640
it's uh something the alarm is funny to

565
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,640
me

566
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,820
yeah yeah my Swiss body is they won't

567
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:22,140
even smoke anymore in the winter time

568
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,538
and they want to go skiing because I go

569
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,038
skiing up near Bavaria obviously and

570
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:27,599
have to drive through there yeah it's

571
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,099
weird because Bavaria I think like

572
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,279
hofbour house and stuff like that you

573
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:35,939
know people getting pissed but yeah but

574
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,579
not yeah not tolerated no have you guys

575
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,140
got a decriminalized model for CBD like

576
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:42,658
can you similar to Switzerland can you

577
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,720
just go to the shops and get CBD cvds

578
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:48,419
everywhere yeah

579
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:52,019
commodity here lifestyle products

580
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:54,780
yeah just a recreational product it's

581
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:57,740
everywhere like flowers or just the

582
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:59,639
flowers and oils and yeah yeah

583
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,019
that's just a trip because like how

584
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,820
they're gonna know you know what I mean

585
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,359
if you've got a bag of CBD weed or a bag

586
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:07,798
of herb like that's not true yeah yeah

587
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,319
it's really confused the cops here and

588
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:12,599
they were pissed they were peace within

589
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,819
the industry because people got busted

590
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,859
and they had the jars from the shop but

591
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:20,700
with their own stuff in it and they had

592
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:23,459
even had a you know receipt from the

593
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,519
shop that's what I had from you know

594
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,740
from the shops and yeah so it caused a

595
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,500
lot of yeah cost of a lot of problems

596
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,779
also people thought that they can smoke

597
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,839
CBD and drive

598
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:38,899
but you are not negative

599
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:43,139
yeah yeah

600
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,940
if you smoke CBD so yeah

601
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,080
even if it's like one percent two

602
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,558
percent or whatever it's still gonna

603
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:52,139
come up yeah they're doing real trouble

604
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:54,058
if you do it over a certain time and I

605
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,400
think some of the you know some of those

606
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:59,339
CBD flowers that people sold were not

607
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,740
0.20.3

608
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:04,859
there were the one percenters and more

609
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,960
you know so yeah and you just walked it

610
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:10,439
on a regular basis like cigarettes and

611
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,620
then you get pulled over and yeah

612
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,480
it was wild I worked two years in the

613
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,798
CBD industry in Austria for a big

614
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,099
producer

615
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,839
and it was wild we could do an episode

616
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:23,839
just about that if you're interested

617
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:30,599
this is a good segue because the next

618
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,279
section is just going to be us talking

619
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,219
about flower

620
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,558
and I know that obviously we all will

621
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,058
not have further insights into like you

622
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,099
know what people are growing and

623
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:43,379
breeding and you know what seeds are

624
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:44,939
available but I I thought for this first

625
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,740
section we just pretend we don't know as

626
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,900
much about that

627
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,058
um and just talk about what flower you

628
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,820
have observed to be

629
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:55,798
available like whether in terms of like

630
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:59,819
Trends or in terms of things that stood

631
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:03,179
out to you or any of those things

632
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:05,220
um so yeah booze I mean obviously we can

633
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,038
talk traditional we can talk about what

634
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,038
you know of legal flower as well but

635
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:13,319
yeah impressions of flower you know or

636
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,700
maybe growing up and what you see on the

637
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,000
market now and

638
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,100
yeah man yeah so uh I touched up so in

639
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,359
Australia um heavy days has actually

640
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:22,918
gone over this but yeah there was two

641
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,740
traditional types of cameras you get you

642
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,299
get the bush you get the Hajj so Hydro I

643
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,058
went over for the most part it was just

644
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:31,379
the page the pgr compact whatever you

645
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:32,940
want to call it

646
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,559
um and I was funny about that man it was

647
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,179
australia-wide like you'd see photos of

648
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,798
like from Melbourne and even you in New

649
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,700
Zealand it was like it was the same [ __ ]

650
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:40,079
like I don't know if it was like the

651
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,058
same cutting that was passed around and

652
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,058
grown or whatever but could you take a

653
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:47,519
moment like elaborating what pgr means

654
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:49,859
and is um I tried trying to pick why you

655
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,359
do this yeah well PG obviously plant

656
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:53,219
growth regulator so there's a lot of

657
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,278
products that have pgrs there's natural

658
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,140
pgrs like tri-continol Alfalfa and stuff

659
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,000
like that but this one in particular

660
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,400
they were using like Bud swell products

661
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,579
and um yeah it was weird man the flower

662
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,278
resulted in this this clumpy hot and red

663
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:09,899
hairs massive stems like you get these

664
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:11,940
tiny little claw leaves but they had

665
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,340
like massive stems on them on the little

666
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,679
like Bud leaflets it was strange sort of

667
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,178
smell basementy you know like a Musky

668
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,860
sort of smell

669
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,940
um not currently going to the high

670
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:23,819
because it was [ __ ] pretty

671
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:26,100
non-existent but uh you know General

672
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:27,599
sort of narcotic thing which when I've

673
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,339
spoken to a crybaby and a lot of people

674
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,839
and Matt you as well obviously people

675
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,759
have this opinion the Australians are

676
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,798
really into sativas but I think because

677
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,658
of this [ __ ] most people sort of tend to

678
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,879
look at cannabis as like a narcotic

679
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:41,159
experience now so yeah because of this

680
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,600
this page a lot of people have um I

681
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,940
guess I don't know just associate the

682
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:47,278
Indigo high with cannabis but yeah aside

683
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,679
from that man the bush so I always loved

684
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,140
Bush whenever I could get it so nimbin

685
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,960
is a town a lot of people have heard of

686
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,179
um nimbin is probably two and a half as

687
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,360
the crow flies driving from me like two

688
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:02,240
and a half hours so I had head there

689
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,379
probably like once a week

690
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,940
when I was getting older and just didn't

691
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,940
want to be around the pgr [ __ ] anymore

692
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,440
and um traffickable amounts so probably

693
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,900
about two ounces here so you know I

694
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,640
didn't exceed that so yeah I was heading

695
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,100
down there every week every two weeks

696
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,600
and you get Bush and it was

697
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:20,480
um my preference you know generally it

698
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,459
was more of a sativa sort of experience

699
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,880
uh big green chunky resinous flowers

700
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,079
tropical smells you'd get hit or miss

701
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,539
um but that was actually where I got my

702
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,298
first seeds so my my first grows were

703
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:35,700
were from seeds from that bushweed from

704
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:37,558
down there and you'd get hydro as well

705
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,500
you get you know [ __ ] that'd slap a name

706
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,778
on Green Crack Jacare you know cookies

707
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,240
stuff like that which was a lot more

708
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:47,940
expensive but uh yeah the bush man yeah

709
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,099
you get decent rates so that and then

710
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,798
obviously medical these days as I said

711
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,139
it's not the greatest but um yeah better

712
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,839
than it used to be at least you can sort

713
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,580
of you know get some variety now like

714
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,740
you know you can get a blue dream or a

715
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,899
GMO or whatever their version of that is

716
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,240
and but yeah on the street

717
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,200
um I don't know I haven't bought reefer

718
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,000
in a long long time but uh yeah I'm just

719
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,740
saying I I guess the quality would be

720
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,538
then a lot more people growing uh it'd

721
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,519
probably be better

722
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:19,379
do you know anything about light I know

723
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,079
that in New Zealand it's become popular

724
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,140
field to just like get weed locally on

725
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,240
Instagram and stuff like oh yeah any of

726
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,940
that and like what do people grow or

727
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,798
like what are people selling

728
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,200
um for a while there was a few groups in

729
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,359
Australia that were doing that uh when

730
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,120
the first like cots like the hot dog

731
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,339
water carts and [ __ ] were coming out and

732
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,599
um yeah people were [ __ ] getting weed

733
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,099
and trimming the hell out of it and

734
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,658
calling it Cali and stuff like that

735
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,939
selling it for a thousand bucks an ounce

736
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:50,640
that was a lot of a lot of that kind of

737
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,620
[ __ ] going on Cali tins just all that

738
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,700
wanky [ __ ] man but since medical a lot

739
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:56,339
of that's gone out the window because

740
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,080
like the price of medical was cheaper

741
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:00,058
than a lot of that was so it's used to

742
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,579
up to that but um yeah there was a lot

743
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:04,139
through Instagram like I for the last

744
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:07,199
time I was buying cannabis it would have

745
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:10,080
been through Instagram for sure yeah

746
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,340
um Matt I put a link into the chat I

747
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,678
don't know if you want to like see if

748
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:15,000
you can share the picture because I

749
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,700
don't know if I want to see I want to

750
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,220
see gold Cuts expert uh reaction to this

751
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,720
well funny thing is don't cut my note

752
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,519
because when I was in Vienna man the

753
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,019
thing that [ __ ] me up was I went to

754
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,058
like Planet hand for whatever one of

755
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:29,579
these head shops and um people were

756
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:30,839
buying seeds and I'd be like okay so

757
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:32,220
there's seeds for sale whatever you'll

758
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,079
be able to find some some good [ __ ] on

759
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,880
the street and then ended up buying weed

760
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,079
on the street in a one too dissimilar to

761
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,760
this what the [ __ ] is this

762
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,939
I can't see it

763
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,640
you can't see it no it's so small it's

764
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,340
just a bag with what what's in there it

765
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,799
looks so cute it is weird it's a bunch

766
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:54,538
of hair

767
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:57,859
it's mostly covered with

768
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:57,859
um sticks it's like a 70s

769
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:04,440
so just all bushed

770
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,658
yeah

771
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,038
looks like CBD flowers from the shops

772
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,039
here oh [ __ ]

773
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:16,319
like this yeah

774
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:18,479
but some of the um some of the stuff in

775
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,460
these mylars does look similar to this

776
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,460
[ __ ] that I've been seeing lately no no

777
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,340
lie and a lot of it um I've noticed it

778
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,019
looks really bad or it has discolored is

779
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:29,398
from going through something they're

780
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,440
doing to try to get through our medical

781
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:34,579
system which is washing it with hydrogen

782
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,580
peroxide yeah

783
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:40,860
dirty ass secret but that's like

784
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,480
I don't J boys Tech can I say that

785
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,240
without getting sued J boys Tech where

786
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,519
they would Wham so I can dip it so they

787
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,960
could pass all the tests of [ __ ] them

788
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,599
and everything and if you just it's

789
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,038
hydrogen peroxide dip and uh yeah a lot

790
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,439
of it ends up looking discolored

791
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:55,859
oxidized

792
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,600
[Music]

793
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:00,139
obviously not putting it in hydrogen

794
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,939
peroxide you're going to oxidize it yeah

795
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,399
yeah well so those of you guys do that

796
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,340
over there yet

797
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:10,379
yeah I did the way to you too I'm sure

798
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,058
yeah do they do that in Australia New

799
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,260
Zealand uh hydrogen peroxide dips are

800
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:15,178
you guys familiar with that uh they

801
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:17,398
irradiated yeah

802
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,720
what the hell does that mean I don't

803
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:20,719
know I think they put it through some

804
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,179
sort of radiation it's relative to

805
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,159
[ __ ] the fungus of whatever gamma ray

806
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:29,179
camera

807
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,179
something like that

808
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:34,439
wow some consequences of that dude

809
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,960
[ __ ] nightclubs man that's the

810
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,820
biggest thing like sayonara tips that's

811
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,798
the biggest thing that I'll say but no

812
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:42,538
but I mean like like the consequences of

813
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,940
smoking something that's been irradiated

814
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:46,619
I'm gonna have some [ __ ]

815
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,100
super villains that don't know what good

816
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,099
weed is

817
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,200
a minute

818
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,120
I'm just gonna say it'd be the same kind

819
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,159
of radiation that they expose like

820
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,139
certain food products too as well yeah

821
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,399
yeah

822
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,080
important fruits and veg that makes

823
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,099
sense yeah yeah but we're not smoking

824
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,778
those and that's the thing when you

825
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:12,178
bring inside

826
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:14,339
but it's standardized it's standard yeah

827
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,100
okay well I think everyone's had a good

828
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:19,220
look at this uh excellent example of

829
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:22,439
flowers

830
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:25,038
oh yeah if you're lucky I kind of like

831
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,038
looking at it

832
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:33,179
okay well same questions for gold cut in

833
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:35,340
terms of the flower that you know you

834
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,259
see on the street I guess

835
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:39,240
um with a both maybe when you're growing

836
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:42,599
up and what do you see more recently on

837
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,778
the street so in the past when I started

838
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:48,418
you know consuming cannabis in general

839
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:51,599
there was a park dealers you go to a

840
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,480
park or you go to a cafe like I told you

841
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,398
there were illegal hash Parts where you

842
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,798
go and wait for five hours or three

843
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,558
hours or you go to a park and buy from

844
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:06,000
what you learn this audio each you can

845
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:07,579
buy grams of hash from I think it was

846
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,079
from Morocco

847
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:12,960
when you were lucky some of them had

848
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,019
Afghani but most of it was from Morocco

849
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,440
very cheap Moroccan hash

850
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:22,919
and then when home growing and uh

851
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,798
Imports started it changed uh some of

852
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,380
those bars then sold flowers imported

853
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:30,720
flowers from from I think some of them

854
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:33,539
were Dutch and the rest was from Germany

855
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,480
from any grows in Germany that also

856
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:38,579
supplied Holland with flowers they just

857
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,159
sold it to other markets so

858
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:44,158
and then when homegrown home growing

859
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:47,460
really started to to take off and clones

860
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,039
I think what people sold or had was was

861
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:53,519
a way what was available as a clone

862
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,460
and those were all uh all Dutch genetics

863
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:00,558
all of them

864
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,558
like white Russian or foreign

865
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,898
I don't know

866
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:13,739
a bunch of those sensitive touch passion

867
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:16,918
um yeah some of those trains were around

868
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:19,799
for very long time you know

869
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,658
but it also at one point I think

870
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,440
everything was played out in the

871
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:27,358
customers and the guys that smoked those

872
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,079
products were not interested anymore and

873
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,519
it changed and uh also what some of the

874
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,460
seed banks that you guys know from

875
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:39,480
abroad from your country started to

876
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:42,358
bring over to Europe and that changed

877
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,480
they changed what people started to you

878
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:47,398
know accept this the new Norm because it

879
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,740
was produced as clone

880
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:52,739
a lot of those seeds ended up in in

881
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:56,638
nurseries as as mother plants and Were

882
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:59,000
Soldiers grown you know like like I did

883
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,680
you know so

884
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,199
it's interesting that you mentioned you

885
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,838
know some of the influence from the U.S

886
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:09,838
um for a moment I just want to ask booze

887
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:11,699
whether or not he you know was there any

888
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,739
kind of like palpable

889
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:16,578
uh influence coming from the U.S that

890
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:19,559
you observed Bruce oh yeah

891
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:21,900
you got all that [ __ ] like the glow

892
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:24,900
trays and the little cookies mylar bags

893
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,220
and stuff like it's it's very true to

894
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,599
this about the Spanish scene as well

895
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,799
every and Matt said at the start of the

896
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,119
episode man you know everything's just

897
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,060
an imprint of the US like that they're

898
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,099
the Pioneers in cannabis it's truth um

899
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:36,480
in modern cannabis at least breeding so

900
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,519
yeah man I don't see a lot of parallels

901
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,199
you know like most of the stuff I see

902
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,079
being grown these days is like cookies

903
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:44,279
gelato sure Mac offsets all that kind of

904
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,079
[ __ ]

905
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,760
um yeah

906
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,680
yeah we'll definitely okay we're

907
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,880
definitely getting to that and my name

908
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,299
the next section was actually going to

909
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,500
be on clones already but gold cut back

910
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,000
to you for a moment it was there

911
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,800
anything else about

912
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,539
the flower that tends to be available

913
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,980
there that you wanted to comment on or

914
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:07,800
how yeah yeah yeah it changed a lot from

915
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:11,579
uh the beginning of the influence of

916
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,619
of the Spanish Market of Catalonia and a

917
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,940
bunch of regions in Spain that produce a

918
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,000
lot of

919
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,820
product for the European market

920
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,400
and it changed to Amnesia everything

921
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,619
turned into amazio

922
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,300
and it was this

923
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:31,920
the Amnesia Phantom look everybody

924
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,740
nobody knew where it's from because

925
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,960
everybody had the same amnesia

926
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:43,500
and it it was at a certain point so

927
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,619
flooded that even average George Moe on

928
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,980
the street border nasia and the back of

929
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:54,059
the friend where I bought was amnesia

930
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:57,240
so in various qualities and

931
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:58,619
um either imported or also grown here

932
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:02,459
because the Clone was also available

933
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:06,180
here and it's still around you know so

934
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:10,220
it changed to Amnesia and then

935
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:13,440
uh people started to accept

936
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:17,279
the fact that uh some of your your

937
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,338
American strains were uh pretty valuable

938
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,280
on the market

939
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:26,519
could sell for a very high price

940
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,920
um and that was the beginning of the end

941
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,500
of wedding cake

942
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,019
where huge political facilities started

943
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,599
to grow wedding cake you know because it

944
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:39,838
was potent the Clone is really good and

945
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,359
uh the market loved it and

946
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:45,420
totally destroyed the price of their own

947
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,279
product which is flooding the market and

948
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:51,059
something that no one would have grown

949
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,900
let's say 15 years back

950
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:57,179
never because of huge lengthy planned

951
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,099
ugly and difficult and

952
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,960
now it wouldn't have yielded enough

953
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:05,660
there's a whole lot about it yeah yeah

954
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,659
and now it turned into a cheap commodity

955
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:13,440
but I think something like RS 11 or or

956
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,300
uh Lemon Cherry gelato or something like

957
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,320
that

958
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,960
the other problem that came with wedding

959
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,940
cake was the hlv viroid being passed

960
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,679
around here

961
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:26,579
via things like the wedding cake that

962
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:28,440
were being spread rapidly like gg4 that

963
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,640
were going the actual clone was making

964
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,838
it to Europe because there was such a

965
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:35,940
demand they'd finally get it there

966
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:38,460
I mean the garage was already here yeah

967
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,740
it was already here the virus but I

968
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:44,119
think so yeah

969
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:47,639
um it's uh you know it's something that

970
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,920
pathogen that is in a lot of uh

971
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,559
ornamental plant facilities and in

972
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,960
gardens and so

973
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,940
why not with cannabis and it was always

974
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,920
poorly treated with even bigger

975
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,800
production companies here that didn't

976
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,599
take care of it properly so it was just

977
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,839
a matter of you know

978
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,820
of time and years were everybody grew

979
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:10,619
the [ __ ] out of let's say a train wreck

980
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,440
in Indonesia

981
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:16,200
especially the Quaker

982
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,519
it was just a matter of time and all

983
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,519
those moms were infected

984
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,000
and that's that's that happened yeah of

985
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,880
course

986
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,980
that's a good segue into the yeah clones

987
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,059
side of things

988
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,519
um

989
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:34,920
booze did we okay you know we talked

990
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,199
about U.S influence obviously but do you

991
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,659
perceive that Australia also was

992
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,639
influenced by Europe

993
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:44,639
um did we see much of like Amnesia Haze

994
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:47,159
down here or anything like that

995
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,539
oh yeah yeah totally yeah but what I

996
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:50,338
meant by that yeah I wasn't discredited

997
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:51,960
in Europe at all but you know originally

998
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:53,460
that [ __ ] came from the states and then

999
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,199
over to Europe was worked that's what I

1000
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,179
was getting at with that but

1001
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,699
um yeah we had a lot of that so a lot of

1002
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:02,338
the first grows I saw were like you know

1003
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:04,618
white widow Super Lemon Haze that kind

1004
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:08,179
of stuff like Greenhouse Barneys all

1005
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,180
that I would say same here

1006
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,500
yep

1007
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,500
um internet market for 30 40 years

1008
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,420
that's for real still do kind

1009
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:24,420
realistically Greenhouse is still the

1010
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,460
big seller you know

1011
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,559
what do you think about any greenhouse

1012
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,199
and Barney's those are the big movers

1013
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,940
that nobody beats them nobody can beat

1014
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:36,000
them the amount of volume of sales They

1015
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:39,858
Do by uh you know moving seeds for other

1016
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,260
vendors so much marketing White

1017
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:45,480
unreal unfucking real and their first

1018
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,820
names everybody hears so they're the

1019
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,440
first people everybody tried so it just

1020
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,940
it's how it works they get everyone

1021
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,679
first

1022
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,358
and everyone bases their experience

1023
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:58,379
growing on what they got from them first

1024
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:59,699
which is even more terrifying to me

1025
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,338
um

1026
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:04,500
okay well booze in terms of in terms of

1027
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:05,940
clones right like what

1028
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,920
I don't actually know anything about

1029
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,740
plants here for example what people keep

1030
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,780
and pass around what do you know of like

1031
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:14,759
what's you know kept and passed around

1032
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,920
over there

1033
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,640
like now yeah

1034
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,260
um

1035
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:21,179
well none of the [ __ ] that you'd want

1036
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,320
really like not not discrediting

1037
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,659
anything I mean none of the stuff like

1038
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,820
the old hazes or like the old sativas

1039
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:27,899
but like you know the old mullum and

1040
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,640
stuff like that I don't think it's a

1041
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,519
rounding clone form like there's seats

1042
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:35,039
but um yeah all the [ __ ] that Wally's

1043
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:37,440
got so obviously at one stage they had

1044
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:39,179
like the C5 the East Coast Sour Diesel

1045
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,159
aside from that things that I've seen

1046
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:43,739
it's just seed pops man that's kind of

1047
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:45,059
what's cool like it's the double-edged

1048
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:47,039
sword It's tricky because I've spoken

1049
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:48,779
about bass lines like when we're popping

1050
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,460
seeds you know it's like we have a clone

1051
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,619
to compare it to it to be like oh yeah

1052
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,838
that's as good as that Etc yeah yeah

1053
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:57,780
anyway so my uh one of my good buddies

1054
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:59,400
uh local bird seed he's um a real good

1055
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,960
guy from Down Under he's doing some

1056
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,280
breeding he's uh I'm actually smoking

1057
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,220
some of his stuff this morning I got

1058
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,680
some TV from Bodhi the Thai Vietnamese

1059
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:09,358
the Destroyer um yeah but so Eli's got

1060
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,699
some great cuttings he's got a harlem

1061
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,940
dreams Band-Aid Haze

1062
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:17,098
as a salad TK from Ochi still Violet

1063
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,139
from pip some great cuttings to get

1064
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,359
around men but um yeah aside from that

1065
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:24,179
there's Dan is a guy that's done some

1066
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:27,239
work with uh a Yeti OG which is like a

1067
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:28,919
lupus headbands and humble snow who's

1068
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,078
been working that I tried some of that

1069
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,159
recently it was really good but yeah

1070
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,720
there's nothing there's not like a

1071
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,920
market like American man it's not like

1072
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,139
you put your finger on and be like oh

1073
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,940
there's the sour or the cam or something

1074
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:41,039
there's just seed pops for the most part

1075
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,460
but they're getting more prevalent like

1076
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:46,079
I try to share clones whenever I can

1077
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,619
yeah and I was going to say as well that

1078
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,000
there isn't that same quality of

1079
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:52,858
globalness uh what I mean by that is

1080
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,599
that like they're obviously going to be

1081
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:56,819
like lots of different pockets of

1082
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,280
Growers scattered around the country and

1083
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:02,400
they're probably not going to be like

1084
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,480
clone hubs or like hubs for mothers and

1085
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,519
stuff

1086
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,800
um I imagine in the same way as like in

1087
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,019
the US and probably Europe as well

1088
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,880
um yeah yeah yeah we're a lot more like

1089
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:13,259
Australia's pretty [ __ ] big and it's

1090
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,420
not like America where the whole country

1091
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,980
is populated you know it's uh you'll

1092
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,019
have pockets here and Pockets there like

1093
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,659
you'll have Brisbane and then the next

1094
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:24,179
like Capital City would be Cairns just

1095
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:25,980
you know nine hours ten hours North more

1096
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:27,838
up Wally Ducks way

1097
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,338
um yeah so it's not it's not like you'll

1098
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,139
have like Sacramento and then Oakland

1099
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:32,219
and then [ __ ] San Diego or whatever

1100
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:34,318
you know what I mean it's it's just

1101
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,179
there's not that degree of sharing and

1102
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:36,960
localized clone trading and stuff like

1103
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:39,598
that

1104
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,338
yeah yeah and with the medical it's just

1105
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,740
all like it's all [ __ ] man it's all

1106
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:45,900
like [ __ ] cookies kosher like you

1107
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,338
know red dankness you know what I mean

1108
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,480
it'll be like a seed pop someone in

1109
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,858
Canada did and they're like all right

1110
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,199
let's let's take that you know it's

1111
00:43:49,858 --> 00:43:56,039
[ __ ] [ __ ] orange Jade or jet fuel

1112
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:58,500
gelato just booth on both

1113
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:00,659
yeah because going back to Gold cut you

1114
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,579
know that is one difference uh Goku

1115
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:04,259
obviously himself has some experience

1116
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,300
like

1117
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,800
um facilitating like clones and and

1118
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,720
whatnot

1119
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,280
um so gold cut in terms of the Clone

1120
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:12,959
scene where you are how have you

1121
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,760
observed that to change

1122
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,220
because you've been obviously embedded

1123
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,260
in it and I know you may have mentioned

1124
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:22,618
some of it already but yeah

1125
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:25,680
yeah I'm producing clones since uh for

1126
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,559
various companies since 2000

1127
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,440
five

1128
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:34,380
2004 somewhere there and what I've seen

1129
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,880
changing was uh from

1130
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:41,700
uh from Dutch seed seed props that most

1131
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,760
of those shops had and those seed Bobs

1132
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:47,460
were passed around without asking to

1133
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,079
every shop I just stole the cards from

1134
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,920
each other and everybody had the same

1135
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,579
[ __ ]

1136
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,318
so that was at one point ridiculous

1137
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:57,720
because everybody had the same [ __ ] and

1138
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,519
then uh yeah like I told you already

1139
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:02,639
changed because of the influence of

1140
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,380
American seats and I think the first

1141
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,259
ones were

1142
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,800
was a lot of was a lot of DNA and a lot

1143
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,700
of PGA

1144
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,060
that came

1145
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:17,759
from in regular seed form some guys

1146
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:19,679
Abacus or some guys in Europe selected

1147
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,780
and passed the carton at one point

1148
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,179
bigger production facilities in Austria

1149
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,400
had those cuts and produced them you

1150
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,679
know so there was

1151
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,599
there was there was a lot of TGA around

1152
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:33,199
and that changed

1153
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,359
the changed I think

1154
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,739
what people expected from a clone you

1155
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,338
know and

1156
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:41,939
um

1157
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:44,338
but it still is split it up in so many

1158
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,039
directions the motivation behind why I

1159
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:49,139
grow and why you can't do it at home or

1160
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,239
for what reason if you smoke you don't

1161
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:53,759
smoke you can't do it for someone you

1162
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,639
can't cuddle it because of financial you

1163
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,359
know interest uh yeah

1164
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:03,358
and no I was not surprised because I've

1165
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:05,639
seen a lot of different aspects very

1166
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,098
early when I travel to the United States

1167
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:11,460
and I think I could uh

1168
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:14,640
you know um I had the most of most of

1169
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,519
the friends that I visited had a let's

1170
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:20,699
say a hippie background or or parents

1171
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:23,460
from you know from the hippie generation

1172
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:25,858
and they had their smokes or their

1173
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,079
habits or you know their you know what

1174
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:31,619
they had around Cuts their head and what

1175
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,260
they cultivated so my first impression

1176
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:38,338
was more in this direction that

1177
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:40,800
I was very well aware that the quality

1178
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:44,460
was amazing everywhere I went everybody

1179
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,859
had amazing smoke compared coming back

1180
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:50,940
home I was embarrassed

1181
00:46:46,858 --> 00:46:52,799
so so much to that sorry

1182
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,960
so I noticed when I started like early

1183
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,660
on working with my friend Ed Borg from

1184
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,460
Delta 9 Labs who was in Amsterdam I

1185
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:01,379
noticed early on like some of the things

1186
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,179
that we were doing in the U.S that was

1187
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,000
marrying what this big Corporation

1188
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:08,940
Called bedrockon in Amsterdam was doing

1189
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,579
at the time so I saw us taking some of

1190
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:14,760
their plays but making it more corporate

1191
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:16,619
driven as opposed to more like small

1192
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,940
criminal organization driven if that

1193
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:18,780
makes sense

1194
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,358
um

1195
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,880
I saw it I saw it being more based for

1196
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:26,159
like uh Rich Corporation people and all

1197
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,380
the laws kind of twisting slowly towards

1198
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,000
that which is very American

1199
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,160
after that

1200
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,099
I've kind of always expected it to be

1201
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,539
you know one overreaching corporation

1202
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:39,059
that it ends up being everything

1203
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:41,159
funneled from one big place into one

1204
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:42,599
main you know how everything kind of

1205
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,338
does everything kind of turns into a

1206
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,539
Monopoly first when it becomes a

1207
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:47,460
commodity

1208
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:49,858
I kind of see that happening everywhere

1209
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,300
and people having to fight back over

1210
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:52,858
time because it's not going to happen

1211
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,480
immediately it's going to be over time

1212
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:57,000
you're going to slowly lose more rights

1213
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,619
we're seeing that so yeah it doesn't

1214
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,358
necessarily surprise me

1215
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,220
what's going on over there and I think

1216
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:05,039
it's only going to continue to drizzle

1217
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:09,179
on to other countries that are feeding

1218
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:11,460
off of the USA's teeth yeah

1219
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:13,139
um I had quite a weird idea I don't

1220
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,940
think we'll have time to do it but maybe

1221
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:18,059
we could do it another time which was

1222
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:22,380
for us to pull up burners lost YouTube

1223
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:24,299
video on visiting Thailand and uh for us

1224
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,858
to kind of like comment on some of the

1225
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:28,859
things that he

1226
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:28,858
global

1227
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:40,980
yeah right here he goes Global because I

1228
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:43,679
will say that

1229
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,000
um this episode that I'm about to refer

1230
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,719
to hasn't actually Gone live yet it's

1231
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,219
going live later today it's uh but ah in

1232
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,078
the previous episode essentially Matt

1233
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,679
and I talk about

1234
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,200
um

1235
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:58,259
the in the state of information right in

1236
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,539
cannabis and how how how kind of messed

1237
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,700
up it is

1238
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:05,219
and uh this had to do with like seeds

1239
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:07,318
and flour

1240
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:09,419
um but you know we've talked about

1241
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:10,739
flower we've talked about clones so I

1242
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,139
think now we just open it all the way up

1243
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,459
we can talk about seeds as well um the

1244
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:15,239
seed Market

1245
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,400
um

1246
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:18,598
but I want to know first of all from

1247
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,880
each of you

1248
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,818
what was it like when you were first

1249
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,740
trying to navigate through the [ __ ]

1250
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:28,199
that it is that is like cannabis

1251
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:30,118
information online

1252
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:33,539
um maybe in terms of like

1253
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,880
obtaining your first seeds or clones or

1254
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:37,920
whatever like how what was that Journey

1255
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,900
like and how how long did it take for

1256
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,059
you to find information that you thought

1257
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,519
was like actually reliable

1258
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:45,900
um maybe we start with booze

1259
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:48,119
yeah

1260
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,338
um I actually can't remember too much

1261
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:52,440
man like I think it was sort of as I

1262
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:54,900
started popping seeds I started to look

1263
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,420
into like online [ __ ] like I was too

1264
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:00,480
young I'm in the 27 so I was too young

1265
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,460
for overgrow and uh the tail end of our

1266
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,679
c-mag and stuff like that so it's really

1267
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,679
just yeah the bread it like bid on

1268
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:10,699
Reddit searching [ __ ] up YouTube videos

1269
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,899
um pretty early on I got Jesus says book

1270
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:14,818
which is I had a little bit of grow

1271
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,318
information in it like not a lot of you

1272
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:17,818
know not a lot of good [ __ ] but I had

1273
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,099
some some good tidbits a lot of cool

1274
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:22,139
pictures of weird little cool pics like

1275
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:24,720
Charlie Garcia's stuff and some cool

1276
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:27,239
stuff and yeah but

1277
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:30,299
um yeah I poor man not too much eh like

1278
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,799
now I'm more into obviously the Discord

1279
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,180
so that was the biggest step for me

1280
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,519
getting into the breed of Syndicate

1281
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:38,279
Discord for sure that was where I sort

1282
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,259
of started to you know expand on my

1283
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,760
genetic and grow knowledge uh

1284
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,460
exponentially yeah

1285
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,619
take note this man's 27 and did his

1286
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,079
research and [ __ ] got to the bottom

1287
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:52,740
of some [ __ ] so anybody can do it at any

1288
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:55,200
age it's not an age thing you don't have

1289
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:57,358
I think I got very lucky forums none of

1290
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:59,338
that [ __ ] well meeting you guys I got

1291
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,019
very lucky I think um and in the

1292
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:03,058
Australian scene I met a couple of

1293
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:05,579
people early that that got me into it I

1294
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,780
had a mentor so to speak like uh my

1295
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:08,640
friend's dad who taught me a lot about

1296
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,460
growing um who'd been growing for years

1297
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:14,219
is it cool great guy importer of uh

1298
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,900
almost like that helped so much it helps

1299
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:17,818
so much to have that you know that

1300
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,800
little bit of like Hands-On mentorship

1301
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:21,480
from someone who's older and he'll teach

1302
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,280
you like the right ways to not just to

1303
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,960
grow but how to interact with other

1304
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,960
Growers that's super important

1305
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,780
yeah and it was I think it could have

1306
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,160
gone a lot different had I spent a lot

1307
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,660
of time online because the first like

1308
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,460
tidbits I got from online were like a

1309
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:37,679
Humboldt seed curve and like greenhouse

1310
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:40,139
and stuff like that you know like yeah

1311
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,639
um meeting my buddy's dad early on was

1312
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,900
great because he was you know the [ __ ]

1313
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:44,699
we were growing was all the old stuff

1314
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,099
from his old days so it was all his like

1315
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:48,480
leftover seeds so inbred a lot by this

1316
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:50,099
stage so it wasn't anything super

1317
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,719
fantastic but you know the remnants of

1318
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:53,338
Thai and stuff like that that he'd been

1319
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:55,799
getting back in the day or he'd been

1320
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:58,078
into imported Indonesian with stuff like

1321
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,240
that so yeah man it was cool learn from

1322
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,559
him and then yeah pretty soon to get

1323
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,939
Discord and off she went oh uh you just

1324
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,740
dropped a tidbit there I want to return

1325
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,780
to later which is where some of the

1326
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:11,399
genetics in Australia actually had come

1327
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,500
from because I I have similar questions

1328
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,300
about New Zealand

1329
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,179
um but yeah before that gold cut how

1330
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,880
about you tell us about your initial

1331
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:22,919
Journeys into the Cannabis information

1332
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,720
space you know what was that experience

1333
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,059
like how long did it take for you to

1334
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,739
find information that was useful

1335
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:31,260
reliable

1336
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:33,779
but pretty pretty quick I found out

1337
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:36,180
about icmac

1338
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,760
and uh

1339
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:41,460
first I was only I was only trying to

1340
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,099
find uh things that are interesting and

1341
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:47,099
made sense for me uh for cultivation

1342
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:50,099
cultivation reasons without having a

1343
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:52,140
account but a lot of the threads were

1344
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:55,380
private you could only

1345
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:57,719
go in with having an account and adding

1346
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,460
something to the whole thing and so I

1347
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:03,419
made an account and tried to share what

1348
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:06,838
I did a clone producer and but it was so

1349
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:09,420
slow I felt like it was too slow for me

1350
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:11,639
the information wasn't you know

1351
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,818
some of the people were not

1352
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:18,838
uh I don't know I didn't feel really

1353
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:22,920
good about it and we had a local forum

1354
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:25,818
but there was also uh I always had a

1355
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:29,818
gardening I mean professional Gatherings

1356
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:32,699
uh take on what I do so it was hard for

1357
00:53:29,818 --> 00:53:34,920
me to find someone who kind of shared

1358
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:36,960
this this uh

1359
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,358
the other experience with a bigger

1360
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,880
facility there was no one out there but

1361
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:44,039
but after a certain time I found a

1362
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,000
couple guys and I think one of the first

1363
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,000
guys

1364
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,800
was actually also sub cooling

1365
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,039
with some of the bigger things that he

1366
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:56,099
had and I also really enjoyed Dr

1367
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:58,318
scanderson very very early in one of the

1368
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:01,140
guys from YouTube also

1369
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,619
um and Maddie he was a good friend of

1370
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:06,598
mine yeah yeah

1371
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:09,240
many Cropper was also one of them which

1372
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:12,599
uh obviously enjoyed because bigger

1373
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:16,019
facilities and kind of a different type

1374
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:18,900
of take on it and this is nice yeah yeah

1375
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:21,179
through that I think

1376
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,420
um I kind of started to

1377
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:26,879
to to to hack my way through budget

1378
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,519
information which was still out there it

1379
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,220
wasn't still in a lot of Road science

1380
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,679
you know what I mean yeah which was

1381
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:37,919
contradicting to what I learned as a

1382
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:40,199
gardener it was gonna wait a minute what

1383
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,700
should I do with this info and a lot of

1384
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:43,858
the products from the United States were

1385
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:47,338
not available here so you have to find

1386
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:51,000
other stuff but uh I think I think

1387
00:54:47,338 --> 00:54:53,519
icmate was the beginning and uh

1388
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,559
and yeah the British indicate this code

1389
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:57,259
is at the very end right now or not the

1390
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:01,339
end but

1391
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,339
now is now

1392
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,519
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1393
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,159
thank you that was

1394
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,920
that was cool

1395
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:11,940
um so Boo's already kind of

1396
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,920
um

1397
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:16,380
gestured towards this but I was going to

1398
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,760
come back and ask like now we're into

1399
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,800
seeds

1400
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,260
um in terms you know in all aspects like

1401
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,000
what are people what seeds do you guys

1402
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,380
see people buying what do you see people

1403
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,300
growing

1404
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,760
um are there people making seeds locally

1405
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:31,440
or actually breeding locally

1406
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,660
um that you've found interesting I know

1407
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,460
okay back to booze I think I know booth

1408
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:37,019
has quite a bit to say about this and he

1409
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,579
also has his own little seed bank in

1410
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:39,539
Australia

1411
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:41,760
um

1412
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:43,079
so booze yeah again and feel free to

1413
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,460
repeat yourself as well I know we've

1414
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:46,920
talked we've touched on aspects of this

1415
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,940
already but yeah what's what it seems

1416
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,780
like

1417
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,780
aspect yeah

1418
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,720
saves life man yeah um so yeah going

1419
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:59,098
back to well how far do we want to go

1420
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:00,118
back are we just talking like right now

1421
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:03,119
or

1422
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:04,380
maybe like uh in the time that you have

1423
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,858
been involved

1424
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,838
cool yeah so when I first got into it as

1425
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:11,699
I said a lot of it was like uh the [ __ ]

1426
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,659
you'd see online it was like humble C

1427
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:18,000
code like Chuck mint OG

1428
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:20,818
before you go further why do you think

1429
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,159
companies like Humboldt Seed Co uh the

1430
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:24,420
first ones to be visible I actually was

1431
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:27,019
trying to figure this out as well I'm

1432
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,579
not sure they they understood SEO early

1433
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:32,400
I'll say it's probably it I don't know

1434
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:33,900
money too uh before Google changed a lot

1435
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,940
of the algorithms

1436
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:39,119
yeah

1437
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:41,519
what's that man it was it was because it

1438
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,500
was because they were backed by dynafim

1439
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,000
who was the biggest producer of seeds on

1440
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,760
Earth they were the same company and had

1441
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,139
same owners so that's why they are so

1442
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,819
distributed because the biggest Seed

1443
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,400
Company on Earth is them

1444
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:55,318
um

1445
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,740
with Brenda

1446
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:57,739
no

1447
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:04,220
uh once HSC hso

1448
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:07,440
yeah both of them are big

1449
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:09,659
uh HSC not so much it's a smoke and

1450
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,900
mirrors thing it's smaller hso for sure

1451
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:14,759
is massive massive

1452
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,220
yeah but man no the weird thing we're

1453
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,960
seeing is the HSC is still big in like

1454
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:20,879
seemingly both Australia and New Zealand

1455
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,260
I don't still don't fully understand why

1456
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,358
I think that's why booze was saying like

1457
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,460
it's partly SEO they they probably have

1458
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,679
quite a bit of like Social Media stuff

1459
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,838
in general I don't know yeah Matt that

1460
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:31,799
one's always [ __ ] with me

1461
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:34,338
organizations but I think it's the

1462
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,680
Humboldt one the one that's got that the

1463
00:57:34,338 --> 00:57:39,259
uh there was perspectives Matt

1464
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,000
Pennington one

1465
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:45,540
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1466
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,420
yeah oh oh yeah the Amherst Sour Diesel

1467
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:50,338
that kind of [ __ ] yeah

1468
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:53,838
organization that's your there's no way

1469
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:53,838
you can lose with that you know like

1470
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:58,920
Instagram they got some good marketing

1471
00:57:56,338 --> 00:58:00,838
going on yeah yeah they got I think

1472
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,280
marketing down pat yeah they had a great

1473
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:03,599
marketing yeah yeah there's a lot of

1474
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,359
that stuff I guess early on man because

1475
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,700
we're talking like 2015 here and also

1476
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,019
um yeah at that time there was an uh you

1477
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:11,639
know there was way less podcasts and

1478
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:14,219
shows and [ __ ] I guess the infancy of

1479
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:15,719
the American legalization had a yeah

1480
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:17,818
limited a lot of information getting out

1481
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:19,799
there so yeah but these days man it's a

1482
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:21,719
bit of everything so through goat by

1483
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,818
seeds uh we stock a bunch of good

1484
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:27,358
breeders so internationally I've got

1485
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:29,880
Matt I've got high and Lonesome we've

1486

1491
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:42,480
really respected guy I don't think I've

1492
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,838
ever heard a bad word said about him

1493
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,519
I've got my buddy Southern Sun seeds who

1494
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:49,619

doc d so yeah so there's some cool seeds

1513
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,440
getting around man but that's um yeah

1514
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,480
that's sort of still in its infancy I

1515
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,579
only started that last year so the the

1516
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,900
motive was to get better seat out there

1517
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,460
because a lot of the stuff that I'd seen

1518
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,559
had been

1519
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,000
um either the imported [ __ ] that people

1520
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:47,640
were getting themselves you know through

1521
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,940
like ilgm or attitude or whatever which

1522
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:52,980
was like a lot of funk or other local

1523
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,960
stuff that had been made available that

1524
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,159
I wasn't super jiving with that I

1525
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,500
thought you know we could do better so

1526
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,719
yeah man that was pretty much it I've

1527
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,760
been just on that Trend just looking for

1528
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:05,399
for cool stuff that I jive with and a

1529
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:09,540
lot of it I grow myself obviously too so

1530
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,880
yeah it's been it's been cool yeah I I

1531
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:14,039
can reiterate on some of that I think

1532
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,240
what I observe in New Zealand is similar

1533
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:16,920
like you have a whole bunch of people

1534
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:20,039
who are growing like the quote-unquote

1535
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,920
the big sea Bank names like Greenhouse

1536
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:26,179
Nirvana Cincy all that

1537
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:29,818
um and then you have the newer hyper

1538
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:33,779
Brands like whatever it is like thug pug

1539
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:35,279
exotic like all that stuff uh in-house

1540
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,960
um it doesn't seem to be the kind of

1541
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,000
like main things that I see like on

1542
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,179
Reddit and all that

1543
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,099
um but I'd actually be really curious uh

1544
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:46,019
whether there are people in New Zealand

1545
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:48,359
doing similar things to you and your

1546
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:51,119
mates over there where obviously you

1547
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:52,739
have access to quite a huge range of

1548
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,960
cool stuff that you guys are working

1549
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:56,459
with I'm sure they exist in New Zealand

1550
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,139
and I'm sure they're people going to be

1551
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,539
listening who are from New Zealand who

1552
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:02,519
can could probably tell us this

1553
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:05,818
um but yeah that's super cool and I

1554
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:08,219
think that's kind of one of the benefits

1555
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:10,500
in a way of having such a fragmented

1556
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:12,500
scene it actually does in a way mean

1557
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,880
that at least you're not beholden to

1558
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:18,000
these major trends that everyone you

1559
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,720
know has to you know revolve around

1560
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,639
um

1561
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,379
yeah so really cool to hear about like

1562
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,298
yeah what you and some people around you

1563
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:26,338
are working on

1564
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:27,599
um yeah gold cut I think you may have

1565
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:30,420
talked to some of this in the last

1566
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:32,579
episode as well gold cut but

1567
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,440
um yeah feel free to not yeah repeat

1568
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:37,740
yourself don't worry about that

1569
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:41,519
um so the question was

1570
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:43,558
seeds seed making breeding locally

1571
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:46,880
um anything interesting going on what

1572
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:46,880
have you observed over time

1573
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:55,440
um it it constantly changes because of

1574
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:58,500
the availability of everything but what

1575
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,679
I see right now is that uh there's a

1576
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,420
certain amount of people that are

1577
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:08,818
inspiring like you said the certain

1578
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:10,500
trendy uh big big ass Milo brands from

1579
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:11,460
abroad

1580
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,880
um

1581
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:16,559
uh and they popped them and uh with the

1582
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,818
hope that they found something special

1583
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,140
out there

1584
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:21,779
um

1585
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:24,298
that's that's one part of the the guys

1586
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:28,140
who buy seeds and and pop those seeds

1587
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:31,798
then there is of course uh Spanish seed

1588
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:33,719
production buyer yeah with the Classic

1589
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:37,199
Brands that we all know

1590
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:39,480
they also I think are a big part of it

1591
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,058
because they're so widely available and

1592
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,000
uh

1593
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:47,460
also affordable they are that cheap you

1594
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,880
know they can buy a bunch of seats for

1595
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:53,220
very you know poverty

1596
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,039
so I think

1597
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:58,039
yeah those are the groups that I see

1598
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,039
um

1599
01:02:58,219 --> 01:03:05,039
of Matthew's work the blue bonnet line

1600
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:06,139
and the amazing hybrids so people start

1601
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,000
to

1602
01:03:06,139 --> 01:03:11,519
understand hey okay there's someone here

1603
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:16,199
that offers them and they try those out

1604
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:18,719
but for most part people the

1605
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:21,719
the biggest group is interested in

1606
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,578
feminized seeds still yeah which I don't

1607
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:26,639
understand but

1608
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:28,920
they still expect okay wow 10 seeds and

1609
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,440
they are not feminized where should I do

1610
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,480
this election how should I handle the

1611
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:37,019
most this and that you know so

1612
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:39,480
acting but it's also a group so it

1613
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:42,358
splits up in those yeah those those

1614
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:45,000
groups that have different expectations

1615
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:47,279
from buying a pack of seeds or or

1616
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,519
popping seeds in general but because we

1617
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:54,240
have so much clones available here and a

1618
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:56,159
lot of the newest hyper hyper strains

1619
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,618
from from abroad

1620
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,480
with people who import them here and

1621
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:03,240
have libraries here somewhere in Central

1622
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,159
Europe and they sell to those nurseries

1623
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:09,179
you know in Austria also

1624
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:11,279
you have a lot of those uh Sushi and

1625
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:14,940
gelatos available

1626
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:18,780
why should you pop seeds well every show

1627
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:20,760
is air by 20 gelatos and pop seats

1628
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:25,019
that's exactly what killed the USC

1629
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:27,420
market and that's also why hlv took hold

1630
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:28,858
you know what I mean because it was a

1631
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,358
bunch of people who didn't want to pop

1632
01:04:28,858 --> 01:04:34,318
seeds because it seemed too much trouble

1633
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:35,880
what if one Harm's on me Etc mindset and

1634
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:37,798
I don't want to mess with males for sure

1635
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:41,640
because they can't even identify ml most

1636
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:43,318
of them even you know so yeah it's same

1637
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:44,940
kind of [ __ ] here people wanted clones

1638
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:47,159
if the Clones here why are we going to

1639
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:48,659
buy seeds and they all had clones they

1640
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:51,358
all cast them dirty

1641
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:54,179
and and you know the number of grown

1642
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:56,219
plants here also started to change with

1643
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:59,519
the the years people started with 20

1644
01:04:56,219 --> 01:05:02,959
plants and now they go 200. yeah so you

1645
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:07,099
want to pop 200 seeds every time yeah

1646
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:10,460
probably not the best idea

1647
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:14,039
variants yeah I know yeah

1648
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:16,500
okay well I have a I have a specific

1649
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:17,940
question for Booze here because I had

1650
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,199
the same question about New Zealand

1651
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:21,838
which is

1652
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:23,279
where some of the older seed stock has

1653
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,719
come from

1654
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,798
um I think between the US and Europe

1655
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:28,618
it's

1656
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:30,000
probably fairly well documented or

1657
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:31,680
discussed

1658
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,239
um but I feel like for Australia and New

1659
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:34,739
Zealand I imagine quite a lot of early

1660
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:37,139
seed stock may have come from Southeast

1661
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:40,199
Asia and I'm wondering booze if you know

1662
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:44,940
much about that

1663
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:46,858
um a little bit man like my uh a mate

1664
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,298
that I was talking about before he spoke

1665
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:50,460
a little bit on that so he was in the

1666
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:53,460
80s importing some Thai some Indonesian

1667
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:56,039
stuff like that so that was I guess the

1668
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:58,139
two sort of most common varieties you'd

1669
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:00,179
find here Indian Indonesian Thai that

1670
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:01,618
kind of stuff and that like Laotian

1671
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:03,960
Cambodian all that sort of stuff that

1672
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:06,660
that general area but um speaking to

1673
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,358
guys like Wally and talking to Sunny

1674
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:10,679
who's mates with Kanga he got to hear a

1675
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:12,480
little bit about what they had around

1676
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:14,519
back then so Kanga was like a world

1677
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,460
traveler he had brought back stuff from

1678
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:20,219
California had some Indian stuff some

1679
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:22,980
Thai mullum obviously a whole bunch of

1680
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:25,679
different stuff Wally had his Laotian he

1681
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,659
had some stuff from Papua New Guinea uh

1682
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:30,298
which got incorporated into that that

1683
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:31,558
z99 that he's got as well so that was I

1684
01:06:30,298 --> 01:06:33,960
guess a lot of the varietals that would

1685
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:36,839
have been found around here not a lot of

1686
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,000
South American stuff I've never heard of

1687
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:41,578
any like Panama or Colombian anything

1688
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,900
like that being grown but I think there

1689
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:45,480
was hearsay that there may have been

1690
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:47,880
Colombian in Milan has never found it

1691
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,980
similar to booking Hayes whatever but I

1692
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,140
doubt that uh this much more assumed

1693
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:54,119
tile or Indian because that's what was

1694
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:55,798
mostly coming in so yeah Wally told the

1695
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:57,298
tale about his uh his mates that were

1696
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:58,739
going to India every year getting seeds

1697
01:06:57,298 --> 01:07:01,079
and bringing them back even and growing

1698
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:02,639
them here and I heard

1699
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:05,880
um when a lot of the Cannabis production

1700
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:09,000
shifted from uh Griffith down in New

1701
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,740
South Wales to Up In mareeba which is

1702
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,239
um I'm far closer to the Equator it's

1703
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:13,500
one of the most conducive places on

1704
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:16,679
Earth to grow cannabis just because of

1705
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:19,739
the tableland water and climate days of

1706
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:21,179
sunshine stuff like that so up in mariba

1707
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,979
I know they were growing lots of Indian

1708
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:25,139
back in the day because when they had a

1709
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,940
massive bust up there in the 90s they

1710
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:29,639
had lots of Indian seeds so that would

1711
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:32,099
have been I guess what a lot of the old

1712
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:35,038
coins came from like the malam vimbi

1713
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:38,818
madness the old mother sativa that Cog

1714
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,859
has posted about and others um yeah man

1715
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:42,239
that'd be it for our Odyssey but not a

1716
01:07:40,858 --> 01:07:44,880
lot of it is around still like Wally

1717
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,858
lost a lot of his D collection Kanga no

1718
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,660
longer around really

1719
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:50,759
um bucket bombs there's a guy that was

1720
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:52,798
around on the forums back in the day uh

1721
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:56,480
yeah on Mr Nice so he's got some some

1722
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:58,559
mock seed still from Kanga and some

1723
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,440
Malawi as well a couple of other bits

1724
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:03,059
and pieces some cool [ __ ] so um yeah man

1725
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,740
there's there's that around still but

1726
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:06,780
none of the old Thai like I haven't seen

1727
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:08,459
anything like in nimbin though you'll

1728
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,680
still get Bush that probably descends

1729
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,019
from that but I wouldn't like I wouldn't

1730
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:15,480
rate it that highly anymore this guy's

1731
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:17,899
use of the word Bush kills me bro yeah a

1732
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,899
bit of bush

1733
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:26,039
I was just gonna say that it's cool that

1734
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,140
it's not entirely derivative from what's

1735
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:30,539
going on in the US and Europe like

1736
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:34,560
Australia has its own like you know

1737
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:35,880
strange like Integrations from elsewhere

1738
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,920
um which is it really has its own

1739
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,420
culture there with the nimbin stuff I

1740
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,520
mean you have your own like cannabis

1741
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:43,020
Superstars there like Tony mullaway and

1742
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,160
people like that like it's a way it's

1743
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,779
different than the US you have your own

1744
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:48,358
culture there it's pretty cool oh

1745
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:50,460
there's a [ __ ] in kind of Bible three

1746
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,440
I think whenever it was that um Jason

1747
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,659
came to Australia it was I think it kind

1748
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:56,219
of Bible two maybe maybe it's one of

1749
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:59,298
those yeah photos that was like

1750
01:08:56,219 --> 01:09:01,140
Blackberry from malware yeah

1751
01:08:59,298 --> 01:09:03,000
apparently it was really good like it

1752
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,259
wasn't like naboos it was super potent

1753
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,659
because he had no business in the same

1754
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:08,880
in the same time

1755
01:09:05,659 --> 01:09:11,460
so bad I've always wanted to get his

1756
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,640
BlackBerry like in seed form but I've

1757
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,640
never

1758
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:17,039
for being able to get a hold of Tony Mal

1759
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:18,119
away or anyone met him that has those

1760
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:20,219
seats but that's one that I've wanted

1761
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:23,099
forever because of that that book

1762
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:24,899
I'm telling you I think I may have met

1763
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,920
him once because I used to go to nimin

1764
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:27,659
often when I was doing like some

1765
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,239
blogging and [ __ ] but also about getting

1766
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:31,920
weed obviously but um one time I was

1767
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,298
invited downstairs at the Hamp Embassy

1768
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,719
and there was a guy down there who had

1769
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:38,219
been making CBD seeds and then he was

1770
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,539
mates with Tony and Tony might have been

1771
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:41,460
there as well but this was like years

1772
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:43,140
and years ago but yeah Tony is a legend

1773
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,640
man I I haven't heard of him in a long

1774
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,600
time but he was like put through the

1775
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,100
ring and he was one of the early

1776
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,980
Pioneers making

1777
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,940
um oil for sick kids similar to smoking

1778
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:52,500
moose

1779
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:54,298
um from from the forums back in the day

1780
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,460
yeah he was right another Legend yeah

1781
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:59,939
just both super

1782
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:01,859
um altruistic who's no longer with us uh

1783
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:03,659
no Miss passed away so moose and sunny

1784
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:05,460
Southern sunsets my buddy they were like

1785
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:06,420
best buds like live right next to each

1786
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,219
other

1787
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,719
um shared a lot of the gear he got from

1788
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:12,300
Neville and Kanga with sunny like the

1789
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:13,319
Kush mullum tie and stuff like that so

1790
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,360
um yeah but Moose passed away

1791
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:17,219
unfortunately yeah

1792
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:18,899
I always talk about I always got a shout

1793
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:21,480
out Moon Unit because he was one of the

1794
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:23,219
dudes on Mr Nice like we didn't really

1795
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:24,599
know each other too well early on but

1796
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,340
like we'd watch each other and he was

1797
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,980
always so legit can't get all those

1798
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:30,480
dudes and when someone was sandbagging

1799
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:32,339
me in the middle of a deal and like kind

1800
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:33,658
of smiling to my face and he knew about

1801
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:35,159
it he made sure that I didn't get

1802
01:10:33,658 --> 01:10:37,139
screwed over just because he saw what

1803
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:38,399
was going on and it was wrong so I've

1804
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:41,940
always thought those guys that whole

1805
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:44,779
crew was always even Kanga Wally all of

1806
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:47,039
them have been so soft

1807
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:49,019
you know like I have a lot of respect

1808
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:52,140
for the Australian Growers they're solid

1809
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:53,820
people yeah it's different than here and

1810
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,739
I've never really heard of Moon Unit

1811
01:10:53,819 --> 01:10:57,479
except you mentioned him once years ago

1812
01:10:55,738 --> 01:10:58,859
when I reached out to you and then Wally

1813
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:00,839
as well but you know everyone speaks of

1814
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:02,819
Wally with such a reverend so Wally was

1815
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,560
like that about Moon he's like man this

1816
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:06,179
guy he did what never never did you know

1817
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,280
he took three land races and made

1818
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:11,039
something equivalent to a modern hybrid

1819
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:12,300
so yeah super super cool man yeah I

1820
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,000
think he's still around I think well he

1821
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,739
said they were talking but I'm I'm not

1822
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
100 on that yeah and if you could get a

1823
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:19,259
hold of him if he could get a hold of

1824
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,819
moon it would be killer just because I

1825
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:23,039
have good memories of that dude like

1826
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:25,198
back then no one was sticking their neck

1827
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:27,060
out for me bro I was Enemy Number One

1828
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:29,158
like like you wouldn't even believe way

1829
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,539
worse than now so like the fact that one

1830
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:32,279
of the Aussie dudes was cool enough to

1831
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:33,600
do that and like because he was putting

1832
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:35,639
faith in me that I'm not going to be a

1833
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,679
scumbag

1834
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,880
and like Sam back him right back for

1835
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,500
having my back because a lot of people

1836
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,840
do that you know like get mad and be

1837
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:46,140
like this person told me you talk crap

1838
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,940
you know like and I yeah they're just

1839
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,800
solid people and it's really back in

1840
01:11:47,939 --> 01:11:51,178
that day it was so rare to find solid

1841
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,640
people to give you anything for someone

1842
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:55,619
else just yeah a little bit of a cult

1843
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,360
following down here it's weird like even

1844
01:11:55,619 --> 01:11:59,698
before all the British Syndicate stuff I

1845
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,979
saw a lot of yoga being grown like

1846
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:04,198
um that's so weird yeah like Yandy

1847
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:06,959
um and uh yeah yeah and then Kelly

1848
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:09,539
Outlaw and a couple other people too

1849
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,039
yeah yeah my buddy's Southern stars out

1850
01:12:09,539 --> 01:12:12,359
there too and he was an early grower of

1851
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,859
my stuff

1852
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:15,779
um yeah

1853
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:17,519
yeah well he is I gave Wally a couple

1854
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:21,000
packs of yours recently man couple packs

1855
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,380
of the blubber maybe the GMO cross as

1856
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,779
well yeah it's been getting around

1857
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:26,940
awesome dude it makes me happy oh

1858
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:28,380
Wally's been so great to me man happy to

1859
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:31,439
kick anything back to that guy he's the

1860
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:33,840
legend just to me too again like I said

1861
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:35,939
all those dudes were just so genuinely

1862
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,920
different than than a lot of the

1863
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:39,960
Americans that were on the forums and I

1864
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,480
felt like I had a much different kinship

1865
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,800
with them because they were so direct

1866
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:45,658
and just they didn't have time for

1867
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,400
[ __ ] it was just like nah mate get

1868
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:49,198
to the get to the point you know they

1869
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:50,579
didn't [ __ ] around and we just were we

1870
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,500
just understood each other on that level

1871
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:54,059
and were able to communicate much better

1872
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:56,698
than I could with the other Americans

1873
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:58,500
yeah more than more than like seed or

1874
01:12:56,698 --> 01:13:01,198
anything from them the most valuable

1875
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:03,179
thing doesn't fold not not 2004 but I

1876
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:05,158
thought a thousand photos that time man

1877
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:06,899
what they've given me it's lovely just

1878
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:08,219
being able to sit there because yeah

1879
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:10,198
that's what I've always wanted man I

1880
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:11,640
love like you know people are a little

1881
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:13,859
bit older I don't know I just get along

1882
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,539
with them I always have another kid and

1883
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:16,679
so talking to these kind of guys that

1884
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:19,380
have been around and hearing all their

1885
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:21,539
stories man it's invaluable I just

1886
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:23,100
thought about it most people won't know

1887
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:26,158
who we're talking about when we speak

1888
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:27,600
about Wally duck he is the creator or I

1889
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:29,819
don't even want to say Creator but he is

1890
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,159
the man who brought Duck's foot that

1891
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:34,079
most people like call things Ducks foot

1892
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,539
traits but he brought the actual plant

1893
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:39,179
Ducks foot uh strain cultivar whatever

1894
01:13:36,539 --> 01:13:41,698
you want to call it uh to to the masses

1895
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:44,279
and worked with it and bred with it and

1896
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:47,219
it's how it got into other hands so he's

1897
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:50,039
like a serious serious Legend to me and

1898
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:51,539
yeah me too man and then he's kept um a

1899
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:52,800
lot of cool [ __ ] alive Down Under that

1900
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:54,539
you'd want to be kept alive you know

1901
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,520
like when you had the C5 so they got a

1902
01:13:54,539 --> 01:13:57,600
bunch of stuff imported um back in the

1903
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,300
day a couple of clones that made it

1904
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,280
across and he had the C5 and obviously

1905
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:03,900
you've got mango Haze IBL early from

1906
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,359
Shanty so that was before Shanti can

1907
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:08,939
that project which was like 2010 or

1908
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:10,738
something whatever yeah yeah he got the

1909
01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:13,019
IBL seats from him and then started

1910
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:14,519
bringing them and um I got a bunch of

1911
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:17,159
them to high and Loans them this year

1912
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,719
man and he's oh that's awesome yeah it's

1913
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:20,279
killer for me because it's like know

1914
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,300
looking from across the paddock because

1915
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:23,460
I haven't been able to grow me out

1916
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:25,380
myself so yeah it's great he's got them

1917
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,579
out so be cool to see what he finds in

1918
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:29,039
them and while he's sending me pictures

1919
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:31,679
he's got some fantastic ones Neville's

1920
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:35,158
Hayes z99 and

1921
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:37,579
um a Laos mango [ __ ] C5 all sorts of

1922
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:37,579
cool [ __ ]

1923
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,698
um

1924
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,560
that no it's really cool and really cool

1925
01:14:41,698 --> 01:14:45,839
to hear more about some of the

1926
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,159
connections as well historically between

1927
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,779
the countries

1928
01:14:47,158 --> 01:14:52,339
um people definitely probably wouldn't

1929
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:52,340
know that so I'm glad you guys

1930
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:56,100
um

1931
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:59,158
I wanted to round out this section on

1932
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:02,039
seeds or like genetics in general was

1933
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:04,559
there anything that any of you wanted to

1934
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:07,079
comment on with regards to the genetics

1935
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,420
in your regions

1936
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:11,399
um any questions for anyone else

1937
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,679
any of you

1938
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:15,658
I got a question for gold cut man when

1939
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,940
did they like legalize or start

1940
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:20,879
tolerating the sale of seed because I

1941
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:22,319
was there in 2015 and they had him like

1942
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,719
over the counter so how long have they

1943
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:28,738
been doing that for

1944
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:30,380
well I think seeds were sold

1945
01:15:28,738 --> 01:15:32,299
or

1946
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:34,980
uh

1947
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:38,100
99.98 I [ __ ]

1948
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:41,939
uh that's better yeah I think somewhere

1949
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:44,579
around there or even earlier in in uh

1950
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:47,339
they bought box seats from Dutch

1951
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:49,319
companies I think mostly positronic and

1952
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:51,600
Sensi seeds repackaged them and sold

1953
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:52,799
them in the first Grow shops and head

1954
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,900
shops

1955
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:58,619
yeah but I think that's where they

1956
01:15:54,899 --> 01:16:01,379
started to sell them to to people who

1957
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:02,939
are all regulars

1958
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:04,319
there you go that's crazy I would never

1959
01:16:02,939 --> 01:16:06,839
have thought it was that long and most

1960
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:08,399
people like fairly self-reliant like

1961
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:11,520
they're just growing their own one or

1962
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:14,460
two plans so yeah yeah a bunch of people

1963
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:16,080
grow go for themselves so for the body

1964
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:18,779
is growing and the other guys growing

1965
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:21,479
and the you know swap with what they

1966
01:16:18,779 --> 01:16:25,859
have and yeah like you say it's like

1967
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:28,259
Homestead cannabis Homestead killer

1968
01:16:25,859 --> 01:16:30,719
a lot I'm not Indiana

1969
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:33,960
especially with the tents I think as

1970
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:38,158
soon as the tent growing started

1971
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:40,079
took off everybody came was capable of

1972
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:42,479
you know Finding space in a small

1973
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:46,079
apartment to grow for their own and

1974
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:48,299
that's where it took off alsobe seats

1975
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:50,340
do you do outdoor where you are like in

1976
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:52,500
Vienna or no I'm gonna ask that too yeah

1977
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:56,219
what's the outside

1978
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:58,399
the auto climate is like in Oregon

1979
01:16:56,219 --> 01:17:02,279
very similar to Oregon

1980
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:05,219
uh yeah it's still wet in in September

1981
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:06,960
end of September October it starts to

1982
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:09,840
get wet so

1983
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,779
not the best idea to grow long growing a

1984
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:16,319
long flowering plants

1985
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:18,238
and that's barely any outdoor and in all

1986
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:21,779
those years maybe it wasn't my focus

1987
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:24,059
also but in all these years smoking and

1988
01:17:21,779 --> 01:17:28,439
and seeing all types of different

1989
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:31,620
flowers there was barely any Austrian or

1990
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:34,619
relevant Austrian or daughter or so

1991
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:34,619
culture

1992
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:43,440
they have a growing culture for outdoor

1993
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:46,198
acclimated plants and for their region

1994
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:48,359
and they'd grow a lot of out of it we

1995
01:17:46,198 --> 01:17:51,479
don't I mean I never had it in special

1996
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:53,579
in Vienna there's no space yeah I guess

1997
01:17:51,479 --> 01:17:57,718
there's cities there I mean there's

1998
01:17:53,579 --> 01:18:00,059
Gorilla growing sure but it's not really

1999
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:01,980
nothing relevant you know

2000
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:04,620
I wish it would be different though we

2001
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:07,139
should I only had it

2002
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:08,340
in the last five years I only have had

2003
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:11,219
twice

2004
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:14,760
really good sun-grown Austrian wheat and

2005
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:18,179
he blew me up completely hot massage it

2006
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:20,640
was so good it was really good

2007
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:23,460
but very rare

2008
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,619
booze how about what's been growing

2009
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:28,198
outside like for you

2010
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:29,939
oh apple is my preference man I love

2011
01:18:28,198 --> 01:18:32,039
growing outdoor that's just the sun like

2012
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:33,359
I grow a lot of vegetables and roses

2013
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:34,859
flowers and stuff like that as well so

2014
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:36,238
just being out in the sun having my

2015
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:39,719
hands in the dirt that's my preference

2016
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:40,979
but obviously legalization and just you

2017
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:42,779
know being able to get a lot of work

2018
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:44,939
done efficiently I've switched to indoor

2019
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:46,559
just so I can you know go through Cycles

2020
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:49,259
quicker I have looked at larger

2021
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,880
populations but um yeah Outdoors where I

2022
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:53,039
started man it was in the first sort of

2023
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,500
seven years of cultivating

2024
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:58,140
um started in pots moved to the ground

2025
01:18:55,500 --> 01:19:00,000
and man in ground gardening was [ __ ]

2026
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:02,640
you know hit and quit it's nothing make

2027
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,319
a good compost water it like four times

2028
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,820
I mean we got good humidity here and

2029
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:06,719
stuff like that and it's about it grow

2030
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:09,420
trees

2031
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,279
it's killer I love it in terms of like

2032
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:14,460
outdoor growing in Australia in general

2033
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:16,380
do you find like do you know much about

2034
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:18,840
the different challenges and different

2035
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,100
regions is everyone having a basically

2036
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,699
it's like is everyone having as good a

2037
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:25,199
time as you or no no I live in like uh

2038
01:19:23,698 --> 01:19:26,879
yeah I'll kind of saying before probably

2039
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:28,619
one of the more conducive places on

2040
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,960
Earth to grow cannabis Outdoors we've

2041
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:33,420
got a um you know not at where Wally is

2042
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:35,219
but I'm you know not down in [ __ ]

2043
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:37,140
where you are aren't they you know I'm

2044
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:39,359
like a more uh I'm higher up more

2045
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:42,300
towards the Equator so I've got pretty

2046
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:44,399
like 14 hours maybe 13 and a half hours

2047
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:47,760
daylight and summer and then you know

2048
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:49,198
probably like 12 12 in winter so it's uh

2049
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,300
super conducive but like down in

2050
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:53,639
Tasmania where like guys like Steve

2051
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,020
Solomon and stuff are um you'll get

2052
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,000
maybe one crop a year you'd probably

2053
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:59,460
want to plan early maybe even do a Dap

2054
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,719
but then up like North so where they

2055
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:02,460
were growing all that cannabis years ago

2056
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,439
you'd get three crops a year out up in

2057
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:06,300
mareeba or like near the Northern

2058
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:08,879
Territory or something like like that on

2059
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,739
the table and yeah

2060
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,380
super conducive to growing outdoor I'd

2061
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:14,819
say it was like these days [ __ ] I don't

2062
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,920
know people say that a lot of it's done

2063
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:18,599
outdoor I more than assume that most of

2064
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,279
the economists grown probably the indoor

2065
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,780
because a lot of the bulk stuff as I was

2066
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:22,920
saying would see would always be indoor

2067
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:24,539
like they're not growing the PGI

2068
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:26,940
Outdoors that [ __ ] pulling it at like

2069
01:20:24,539 --> 01:20:28,738
seven weeks six weeks indoors so I'd say

2070
01:20:26,939 --> 01:20:30,839
that like 80 of the Cannabis in

2071
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:33,119
Australia it's grown it's grown indoors

2072
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,920
which is [ __ ] in the head because you

2073
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:36,140
know we're like a solar panel of a

2074
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,399
[ __ ] country

2075
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:39,420
yeah yeah so you're saying that there's

2076
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:41,759
nothing

2077
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:43,380
well for uh for certain parts of the

2078
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,880
country there's nothing you know in

2079
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:47,100
terms of the environment anyway that's

2080
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,260
like would be a barrier to Growing Up Oh

2081
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,520
humidity like up right you want to yeah

2082
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,600
you don't want to grow like big butt

2083
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,520
like where I am you're going to grow

2084
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,020
something otherwise I prefer to the TV

2085
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,880
[ __ ] so I've always grown like longer

2086
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:58,500
flowering stuff but yeah like down south

2087
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,719
so where a lot of it's grown like

2088
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:03,300
nimbing and super wet but nimin there's

2089
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:05,340
a lot more rain uh rain days than where

2090
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,840
I am so that's it's strange but it's

2091
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:09,000
just where people congregated man like

2092
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,619
around like Byron Bay Northern Rivers

2093
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,300
nimbin is where a lot of the hippie

2094
01:21:10,619 --> 01:21:14,399
communes were and then up north there

2095
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,440
was like Cedar Bay

2096
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:18,539
um and uh rainbow or something another

2097
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:19,738
like hippie commute so I let a lot of

2098
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:21,359
the hippies come together was where a

2099
01:21:19,738 --> 01:21:23,879
lot of the Cannabis was grown so yeah

2100
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:25,799
down south you got the cold you got

2101
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,859
[ __ ] bugs mites you know that kind of

2102
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:30,659
stuff Bush turkeys kangaroos you know

2103
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:32,819
when you're growing out in the out in

2104
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:34,559
the woods so yeah all sorts of pests and

2105
01:21:32,819 --> 01:21:36,658
just just the usual stuff man but yeah

2106
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,340
no not a lot of you know there's nothing

2107
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:40,379
there's not a lot of snow like down

2108
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:42,000
south a little snow but [ __ ] yeah you

2109
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:44,480
can pretty much grow anywhere I've seen

2110
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,479
it everywhere

2111
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:50,939
that's right

2112
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:52,859
um I thought we could move on to

2113
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:54,960
kind of like rounding this out but also

2114
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:57,420
just like some lighter and maybe more

2115
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,439
open questions

2116
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:00,840
um

2117
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:03,419
and so I guess if we zoom out all the

2118
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,000
way I I was curious on us reflecting on

2119
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:07,199
like the overall culture of cannabis

2120
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,179
Where You Are

2121
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:11,039
and just like I don't know do you you

2122
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:12,779
know are there

2123
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:14,640
are there interesting things that you

2124
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:16,679
notice when you think about

2125
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,480
people smoking or growing where you are

2126
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:21,480
related to other places like what's

2127
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:22,259
what's weird about it what's different

2128
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:24,599
um

2129
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:26,039
from say the US which we all you know we

2130
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,020
all know quite a lot about

2131
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:29,640
um is there anything that you would want

2132
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,460
to see change

2133
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,960
as well

2134
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:36,179
very broad just like yeah super broad

2135
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,480
Reflections on like yeah cannabis Where

2136
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:38,480
You Are

2137
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:46,500
to who

2138
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:50,939
anyone really

2139
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:55,439
go ahead Gold Coast or gold Tech

2140
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:57,960
um what I would love to change or what

2141
01:22:55,439 --> 01:23:00,059
what I would love to see changing in the

2142
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:04,079
future here in Austria it would be the

2143
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:06,840
aspect of mixing tobacco with cannabis

2144
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:09,899
something that I also did a lot of

2145
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:11,039
course because I was smoking tobacco but

2146
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:13,379
I quit

2147
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:15,359
almost 15 years ago

2148
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,340
but it was also part of my smoking

2149
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:18,899
routine and habits you know that's how

2150
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:21,600
we spoke in the past when there was only

2151
01:23:18,899 --> 01:23:24,779
hashish how we used to smoke it if you

2152
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:28,620
don't mix it into a split but that that

2153
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:31,279
habit lasted so it sealed around with

2154
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:34,198
most of the people I know

2155
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:35,639
who smoke joints like that you know I

2156
01:23:34,198 --> 01:23:38,119
wish

2157
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:41,520
more awareness would would

2158
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:43,079
happen and people you know would start

2159
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:46,500
to

2160
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:49,198
to stop smoke that much that backwards

2161
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:50,760
Terribles everywhere I couldn't if I go

2162
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:53,939
out and I meet with a bunch of people

2163
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:57,239
and maybe out of 20 people smoking

2164
01:23:53,939 --> 01:23:58,859
there's me and one Rasta guy who's not

2165
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:01,859
smoking tobacco you know what I mean

2166
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:04,500
actually

2167
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:06,658
this is a good line of questioning

2168
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:09,000
um yeah is there anything else about how

2169
01:24:06,658 --> 01:24:10,738
people consume their cannabis that's

2170
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,020
weird or like that you think might be

2171
01:24:10,738 --> 01:24:14,399
weird where you are I mean tobacco in

2172
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,719
Europe is obviously a big one I would

2173
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:17,779
say that it's still big in New Zealand

2174
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:21,119
probably still big in Australia as well

2175
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:24,000
are there any other like uh nuances or

2176
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:26,760
Oddities about how people ingest or

2177
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,198
consume cannabis Where You Are like okay

2178
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,840
example

2179
01:24:28,198 --> 01:24:33,960
um we had an episode on glass right and

2180
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,340
an American Glass a few weeks ago and it

2181
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,600
became really clear to me that different

2182
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:38,100
countries are obviously in very

2183
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,800
different places when it comes to do

2184
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:43,260
with like smoking tick

2185
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,940
um and smoking culture and all that so

2186
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,800
now I've become a bit more curious about

2187
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:49,319
like what some of these differences may

2188
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,779
be I would say that people here aren't

2189
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:54,000
like into Debs at least not much like

2190
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:55,859
not many there are a few

2191
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,219
but

2192
01:24:55,859 --> 01:25:02,579
yeah goka I mean back to you yeah I

2193
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:06,239
think that that we have an old tradition

2194
01:25:02,579 --> 01:25:09,000
or long tradition of forms of pink glass

2195
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:10,019
bombs like the the company raw I'm sure

2196
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,539
you know

2197
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:15,480
so there is something that is a

2198
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:18,779
traditional smoking device here if you

2199
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:21,479
are the you call yourself a smoker here

2200
01:25:18,779 --> 01:25:24,300
in Central Europe in the past you must

2201
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:26,279
have a giant [ __ ] bomb yeah giant

2202
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,219
probably really ugly right

2203
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:31,619
yeah China glass or a rule if you had

2204
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:32,819
the money you would buy a roar but if

2205
01:25:31,619 --> 01:25:35,460
you don't have the money you buy a China

2206
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:38,340
glass of course and there was no there

2207
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:41,399
was no um there was no heady glass for a

2208
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:43,140
long time that changed there's there's a

2209
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:45,259
bigger and bigger group

2210
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:47,880
uh

2211
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:50,340
who bike ahead of classroom it's an

2212
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:52,500
awesome European glass flows so that

2213
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:55,159
changed I think what's what's a bit

2214
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,158
weird is

2215
01:25:55,399 --> 01:26:02,279
if the people stop smoking or they have

2216
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:04,800
the intention to stop consuming uh

2217
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:07,099
tobacco with cannabis they immediately

2218
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,380
buy a pocket vaporizer

2219
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:13,320
that's something that everybody has at

2220
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:16,260
least two in the draw that don't work

2221
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:19,019
anymore and they buy those DaVinci's and

2222
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:21,360
start some biking and everybody has a

2223
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:24,780
pocket vaporizer which is cool of course

2224
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:27,420
it's amazing and volcanoes of course

2225
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:30,359
volcanoes are something that I think the

2226
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:32,880
central European smoker uses a lot and

2227
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:37,819
she looms which are disgusting if you

2228
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,819
know what I mean big Indian shillongs

2229
01:26:46,219 --> 01:26:52,279
that's something really nasty that

2230
01:26:48,539 --> 01:26:52,279
European special Italians

2231
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:58,679
yummy yeah but what else I don't know

2232
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:01,440
what's what's yeah the the charcoal

2233
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:03,380
filter that's something yeah yeah yeah

2234
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:07,138
yeah yeah

2235
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:11,819
every bit Yeah they all have have to

2236
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:13,560
have a big ass bag with charcoal Fitness

2237
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:15,359
do you see is everyone still rolling

2238
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,820
like massive do people use the rolls

2239
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,158
like little tear off papers still yeah

2240
01:27:17,819 --> 01:27:21,719
in Switzerland I saw that [ __ ] people be

2241
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:23,719
rolling like 20 centimeters or 30

2242
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:26,639
centimeter joints

2243
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:30,000
like three cigarettes yeah like a

2244
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:31,920
Dutchman spliff it's gross yeah yeah I

2245
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,960
got into it it's a bummer but yeah

2246
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,880
that's how I sort of got addicted to

2247
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,579
Tobacco I guess just by smoking that way

2248
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:41,520
I don't know I have friends I have

2249
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:44,460
friends who never smoke cigarettes and

2250
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:46,199
we when they started to smoke weed of

2251
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:49,020
course it mixes the tobacco and they

2252
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:50,779
started to be addicted to Tobacco up

2253
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:54,659
with 35

2254
01:27:50,779 --> 01:27:57,059
years you know what I mean it's crazy

2255
01:27:54,658 --> 01:27:58,559
yeah that's me I was dumb as [ __ ] like

2256
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:00,539
never smoked cigarettes in my life but

2257
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,980

school exchange and yeah I didn't smoke

2263
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,619
much before I went over there it was

2264
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,658
mostly just bombs like everyone over

2265
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:18,359
here just would get a plastic bottle Jam

2266
01:28:15,658 --> 01:28:20,119
a bit of Hose into it a little like you

2267

know half inch socket and then yeah

2268
01:28:20,119 --> 01:28:25,139
bubbling away I saw some gross ones man

2269
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:26,819
like you know from older friends it'd be

2270
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:28,619
you know 10 years old and never changed

2271
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:31,158

01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:31,158
awesome

2273
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:38,039
but I got into the spliffs hard and I

2274
01:28:35,698 --> 01:28:39,539
didn't even realize like Barry true

2275
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:41,579
cannabis has talked about this as well

2276
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:43,019
but yeah I was barely smoking like you

lung is a Lungi only it's like when your

2295
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:48,000
friend passes out and you get a bag on a

2296

bong and you like pull it and then blow

2297
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,340
it in their face

2298
01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:56,279
there's some overlap so for us along is

2299
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:58,560
like you you get like a 1.5 or whatever

2300
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:01,019
two liter like Coke bottle right yeah

2301
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:04,080
cut the bottom off you take a plastic

2302
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:05,820
bag to the end yeah put that you push

2303
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:07,439
the bag all the way in there's a cone

2304
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:10,439
piece on the top of the bottle and then

2305
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:12,719
you pull the bag through like out of the

2306
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:14,759
model and you have like a four liter

2307
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:18,060
like hit right so it's like like and

2308
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:21,199
it's like a wish gravity bong I'm sorry

2309
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:21,199
yeah yes

2310
01:30:22,219 --> 01:30:27,739
this yellow is [ __ ] by the time you get

2311
01:30:24,779 --> 01:30:27,738
that lid off the bottom

2312
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:34,939
yeah everything's plastic yeah never

2313
01:30:32,939 --> 01:30:37,259
hurt no one

2314
01:30:34,939 --> 01:30:39,599
like in New Zealand people doing bucket

2315
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:41,280
boxes as well yeah yeah as well that's

2316
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,139
some that's from my dad's time my dad

2317
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,059
was doing ripping bucket box in the

2318
01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:46,139
[ __ ] 80s and 70s and [ __ ] so what's

2319
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,580
weird is we have this thing called

2320
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:49,079
Learners here

2321
01:30:47,579 --> 01:30:50,639
and it's when you get it it's when you

2322
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:52,198
get a two liter bottle right and you cut

2323
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:55,560
a whole lot on one side but you leave

2324
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:57,658
you leave about I'd say two inches of

2325
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:01,800
plastic and then you put your dick in it

2326
01:30:57,658 --> 01:31:01,799
and have your friends suck it yeah

2327
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:08,420
we call that [ __ ] A Tuesday over here

2328
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:14,698
oh my God I'm already getting it enough

2329
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:18,560
people telling me

2330
01:31:14,698 --> 01:31:18,559
telling actuality in my closet

2331
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,899
oh my God because the other piece of

2332
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:28,138
tech that's Infamous of course is the

2333
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:29,519
hot knives and like yes so I I somehow I

2334
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:31,440
mean the last few years realized that

2335
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,420
hot knives are just the precursors to

2336
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:35,399
Vapes and I was just like what but

2337
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:38,760
that's kind of true I guess you are

2338
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:42,719
vaporizing me the weed like uh at least

2339
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:45,179
partly I think rosin native vaporization

2340
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:47,880
techniques I don't know I mean it's like

2341
01:31:45,179 --> 01:31:50,100
yeah so I'm using heat technique and to

2342
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:55,279
make the resin

2343
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:55,280
oil yeah yeah yeah yeah basically

2344
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,539
um

2345
01:31:57,139 --> 01:32:03,539
or on the goal was we take a needle and

2346
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:05,519
break off a piece of her sheesh put it

2347
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:08,479
on the needle and heat it up and smoke

2348
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,480
it like that you know

2349
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:15,239
so it had to be a hashish that wasn't

2350
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,920
like super high quality to do that

2351
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:19,759
though right yeah yeah like if you get

2352
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:24,179
to it Melody it would just melt my house

2353
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:26,280
yeah it's just it was just Moroccan I

2354
01:32:24,179 --> 01:32:27,539
was trying to use my my hash Kettle the

2355
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:28,859
other day because I wanted to do a

2356
01:32:27,539 --> 01:32:30,600
review on it because it's a beautiful

2357
01:32:28,859 --> 01:32:33,479
piece and it's like kind of new thing

2358
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:35,820
that this company sells and uh they said

2359
01:32:33,479 --> 01:32:37,859
you need to use hashish and I didn't

2360
01:32:35,819 --> 01:32:40,259
really understand what that meant at the

2361
01:32:37,859 --> 01:32:42,299
time so I got this beautiful [ __ ]

2362
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:45,179
beautiful Temple ball hash from my buddy

2363
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:47,880
spinach beautiful smokes great and I put

2364
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:49,100
it in there go to smoking and went just

2365
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:53,000
gone

2366
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:56,579
it was too pure too nice

2367
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:00,119
it did not serve the purpose it needs

2368
01:32:56,579 --> 01:33:02,279
more plant material not only resin yeah

2369
01:33:00,119 --> 01:33:05,000
it needs like legit like shitty hash

2370
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:05,000
yeah

2371
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:08,399
it was funny though because it was so

2372
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:12,920
pure

2373
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,920
I was like man it's true no

2374
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:18,000
yeah

2375
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:20,280
um while we're on like techniques I want

2376
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:24,619
to ask both booze and gold cut how big

2377
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:24,619
are dabs and dab rigs Where You Are

2378
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:31,139
um getting bigger like I started I got

2379
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,639
into it early I was lucky enough I'm not

2380
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:34,440
lucky but I found a guy that was making

2381
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:36,239
him he had invested a shitload of money

2382
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:38,339
into like across International gear so

2383
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:42,178
he was making like proper Purge oven

2384
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:44,520
[ __ ] BHO like de-waxed uh early on

2385
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:46,500
you know 2017. so I was getting all

2386
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,940
sorts of dabs from him you know he was

2387
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,679
mucking around with like diamonds and

2388
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:51,419
sauce and Shadow and all sorts of

2389
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:53,880
[ __ ] rosin

2390
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:55,500
um but yeah carts even were around for a

2391
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:58,380
while but like on a medical scene you

2392
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:00,238
can get I think water harsh but um yeah

2393
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:01,980
dabs not super big unless you've got to

2394
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:03,658
press yourself like I haven't really

2395
01:34:01,979 --> 01:34:05,158
seen too many available like on

2396
01:34:03,658 --> 01:34:06,839
Instagram I've seen some pens and stuff

2397
01:34:05,158 --> 01:34:08,759
like that I've tried one or two they're

2398
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:10,020
like really good quality but for the

2399
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,880
most part yeah you're just making your

2400
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:13,500
own man like most people will just get a

2401
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,060
press like either one of the cheap like

2402
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:17,460
a lot of the Hydra stores here even sell

2403
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:18,900
them like [ __ ] pretty up Market ones

2404
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:20,100
so yeah I think people are just pressing

2405
01:34:18,899 --> 01:34:22,619
it

2406
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:24,800
more prep more wasn't than than butane

2407
01:34:22,619 --> 01:34:24,800
yeah

2408
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,039
yeah I think with with internet and with

2409
01:34:29,219 --> 01:34:33,480
especially with internet plugs

2410
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:34,738
everything has changed and also people

2411
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:37,319
can on the

2412
01:34:34,738 --> 01:34:39,119
far Countryside in Austria you can buy

2413
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:43,380
imported

2414
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:46,279
imported roles and imported BHO and so

2415
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:46,279
it changed but

2416
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:52,920
it took a very long time to to make

2417
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:56,219
people understand hey you cannot smoke

2418
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:58,980
this black tar that you extracted out of

2419
01:34:56,219 --> 01:35:01,439
the plastic pipe you know it should

2420
01:34:58,979 --> 01:35:04,979
probably not dab this stuff if it's

2421
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:09,059
crackling that took a very long time and

2422
01:35:04,979 --> 01:35:11,158
uh from titanium to quartz it also took

2423
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,800
some time

2424
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:17,599
um but it's still very small

2425
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:20,760
um like who said the cartridges

2426
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:23,280
took off at a certain point and they are

2427
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:26,280
widely available but like I said

2428
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:29,880
um Instagram and plugs online changed it

2429
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:33,359
completely it was so widely available if

2430
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:35,480
you uh if you're interested

2431
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:35,479
um

2432
01:35:35,698 --> 01:35:39,899
I'm just kind of like spitballing a bit

2433
01:35:38,039 --> 01:35:43,139
here but one other thing that came to

2434
01:35:39,899 --> 01:35:45,658
mind that isn't related to sorry is it

2435
01:35:43,139 --> 01:35:48,420
related to dabs or anything

2436
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:51,000
um both Europe and Australia seem to

2437
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:52,739
have a healthy interest in Haze is that

2438
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,100
am I right in saying that do you guys

2439
01:35:52,738 --> 01:35:59,238
think yeah yeah for sure what's wrong

2440
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:59,239
what's wrong with America

2441
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:08,639
the pith that you got Matt passed to you

2442
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:12,779
back in like whatever 2015 or 16

2443
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:14,400
whatever it was was that like yeah what

2444
01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:15,658
was that like

2445
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:18,119
well like the frankincense you're

2446
01:36:15,658 --> 01:36:19,679
talking about it's 2009. oh [ __ ] age and

2447
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:22,319
it's the frankincense metallic disc

2448
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,420
Hayes aside you guys maybe it's better

2449
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:26,460
for them

2450
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:28,679
yeah that was a good that was really

2451
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:30,420
good unpacking I think of you know the

2452
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:31,859
state of haze and some of the reasons

2453
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:34,139
why

2454
01:36:31,859 --> 01:36:35,939
were there any other

2455
01:36:34,139 --> 01:36:38,100
any other questions that you'll have for

2456
01:36:35,939 --> 01:36:39,238
anyone else or their their countries or

2457
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:40,679
regions

2458
01:36:39,238 --> 01:36:43,198
um anything else that you observe that

2459
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:44,100
you want to provoke or yeah ask anyone

2460
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:46,500
else

2461
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:49,460
um yeah I would like to ask Matthew

2462
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:53,819
because he just talked about beef and uh

2463
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:56,179
and Frankie and uh how far away are they

2464
01:36:53,819 --> 01:36:56,179
from

2465
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:05,698
yeah I'd be curious about that uh as far

2466
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:07,380
as Amnesia Haze the world the difference

2467
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:09,719
like as far as what I'm used to as

2468
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:11,159
Amnesia Haze is like you know the core

2469
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:13,319
cards we talked about yeah yeah yeah

2470
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:16,559
like the it's almost floral mercy and

2471
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:18,238
perfume to me yeah and and and that it's

2472
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,039
just so different from that it's um

2473
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:22,678
you'd really have to go to a Catholic

2474
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:23,760
Church uh Catholic Mass on Christmas and

2475
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:25,859
why

2476
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,659
smell on earth like it it would it would

2477
01:37:25,859 --> 01:37:29,039
develop that sense memory and everything

2478
01:37:27,658 --> 01:37:33,259
you smell from that point on you'd be

2479
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:33,260
able to identify pith like that

2480
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:42,300
not it

2481
01:37:37,859 --> 01:37:45,500
I I've had Amnesia that was ex I've had

2482
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:48,719
Amnesia there was crazy frankincense

2483
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:50,760
smelling and tasting

2484
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,840
almost over time I've never had any like

2485
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,480
that

2486
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:57,000
well so it's interesting the hyper

2487
01:37:54,479 --> 01:38:00,439
Amnesia that is available in seed form

2488
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,439
has that is

2489
01:38:02,939 --> 01:38:05,719
I

2490
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:10,139
mean like if it has stuff like that in

2491
01:38:08,039 --> 01:38:12,238
it I want to see it and run it because

2492
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:14,219
that's the stuff that I think that that

2493
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:16,979
really holds a lot of special

2494
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:19,380
um highs when you get into the real I

2495
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:22,019
think the main reason here I shoot is so

2496
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:25,800
still so popular is because of big

2497
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:29,179
yields this is a huge [ __ ] useless

2498
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:29,179
yeah makes sense

2499
01:38:29,698 --> 01:38:34,638
and now we're gonna see some Bonnet

2500
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:37,380
Amnesia crosses I'm just kidding

2501
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:39,960
I mean you know what if I could pick um

2502
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:43,500
if I could pick Frank frankincense and

2503
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:45,840
myrrh like that combination out of that

2504
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:47,520
yeah any day and I and you know if like

2505
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,020
I bet if you could get hit the

2506
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,340
frankincense Zone you could probably get

2507
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:53,040
something very close to that smell

2508
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:55,199
anyways that's pretty cool so we've got

2509
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:57,658
a cutting down here that my buddy found

2510
01:38:55,198 --> 01:39:00,599
it's from piff Coast it's across of

2511
01:38:57,658 --> 01:39:04,079
Santa clue uh Santa Cruz blue dream

2512
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:06,600
across to a pith S1 so I'm not sure so

2513
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,279
he found a lot of like basementy type

2514
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,020
stuff in that and he found some almost

2515
01:39:08,279 --> 01:39:11,519
weird like caramel stuff even but one

2516
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:13,860
that he found that we've kept is like

2517
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,360
pretty bang on frankincense like I can

2518
01:39:13,859 --> 01:39:16,799
pick up like the frankincense incense

2519
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:18,059
sticks put it next to it and move you

2520
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,340
know four or five of us now have been

2521
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:22,020
like yup made that like um yeah

2522
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:25,199
comparison so it's awesome and it's

2523
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:27,300
great smoke so the smell of

2524
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:30,479
um pith though it like that's the thing

2525
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:34,139
it's not just frankincense yeah yeah no

2526
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:36,238
I'm not yeah most like you have to have

2527
01:39:34,139 --> 01:39:38,520
mer with it and burn it and that's the

2528
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:40,799
smell like it's it's like there's a it's

2529
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:43,139
not just together you burn it and you

2530
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,960
swing it and it like that's what the

2531
01:39:43,139 --> 01:39:48,420
smell of it it's like a funeral we would

2532
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:50,399
have it at funerals every right yeah

2533
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:52,880
super heavy super heavy you'll never

2534
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:55,859
forget it it's in your apartment

2535
01:39:52,880 --> 01:40:00,000
yeah it gives me a damn headache like

2536
01:39:55,859 --> 01:40:01,859
that smell yeah pif stuff is somewhat

2537
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,319
interesting I'm way more interested in

2538
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:05,819
like the A5 and the C5 and the dog [ __ ]

2539
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:07,738
and stuff like that that's like meaning

2540
01:40:05,819 --> 01:40:09,960
a haze resolution in the states I didn't

2541
01:40:07,738 --> 01:40:12,059
see anywhere near as many like dog [ __ ]

2542
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:14,698
or Betsy crosses as I'm seeing these

2543
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:17,400
days like CSI high and Lonesome yourself

2544
01:40:14,698 --> 01:40:18,899
Matt yeah we all have it you know that

2545
01:40:17,399 --> 01:40:21,059
just Shabad and

2546
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:23,158
um and CSI you know like they they

2547
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:24,539
really brought my attention to it like I

2548
01:40:23,158 --> 01:40:27,359
was mostly interested in all Betty

2549
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:28,920
because of bull rider and it's uh you

2550
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,559
know San Diego classic like when I was

2551
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:34,079
down there Paul writer was it and

2552
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,460
um and Betsy is supposedly the sister of

2553
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:38,039
bull rider and I could see that being

2554
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:39,060
very possible if it if bullrider is the

2555
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:41,219
way

2556
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:42,719
people say it was

2557
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:44,698
um so that always interested me because

2558
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:46,920
of that in general and dog [ __ ] I mean

2559
01:40:44,698 --> 01:40:48,960
That's a classic right so I had to know

2560
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:51,060
what that was like but I don't know that

2561
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,158
any of those are very piffy to me but

2562
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:55,560
that's that's the other Factor like I'm

2563
01:40:53,158 --> 01:40:57,920
not mentioning is how everything is so

2564
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:00,659
subjective and how we smell stuff isn't

2565
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:03,359
necessarily the same and that's really

2566
01:41:00,658 --> 01:41:06,299
really really like I eat forget daily

2567
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,799
how important that part is daily in the

2568
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:10,500
conversation

2569
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:11,460
yeah yeah I'm like it's almost like a

2570
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,020
Renaissance of the Blue Dream

2571
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:14,460
billionaire right now too I think I've

2572
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:16,679
seen [ __ ] like six years or five

2573
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:19,100
years growing that code again too yeah

2574
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:19,100
you know

2575
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:23,100
that Cut's been held back for a long

2576
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:25,799
time because so many people threw it

2577
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:28,380
away and only like I mean I knew like

2578
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:30,000
one two people who kept it all these

2579
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:32,340
years because like

2580
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,779
it was it was like Kryptonite for

2581
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:35,520
everyone for a while because so many

2582
01:41:33,779 --> 01:41:37,859
seed lines came out with that name and

2583
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:39,659
were released so many bad grows of that

2584
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:42,000
same cut growing it commercially and

2585
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:45,479
just [ __ ] blown it out so nobody really

2586
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,340
kept it and um yeah it's it

2587
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:49,500
it's funny to see it pop up in a bunch

2588
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:51,360
of places other than you know like small

2589
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:53,100
places in California but there there is

2590
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:54,779
a chance other people did keep that cut

2591
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:57,239
because it was everywhere for a while

2592
01:41:54,779 --> 01:41:58,920
and every Collective and if you did it's

2593
01:41:57,238 --> 01:42:00,118
it's pretty identifiable in how it

2594
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,980
breathes it's got this beautiful like

2595
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:02,759
dryer sheets thing to it that it passes

2596
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:03,479
on

2597
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:05,159
um

2598
01:42:03,479 --> 01:42:06,839
that's one of my favorites one of my old

2599
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:09,559
favorites and it gets bagged on so much

2600
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,560
but I love it

2601
01:42:10,139 --> 01:42:15,300
absolutely okay well we're coming to the

2602
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,800
end of the talk I think a bit we're

2603
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:18,719
almost at the two hour mark and

2604
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,219
conscious that for gold cut it's getting

2605
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:22,739
pretty late

2606
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:24,480
um maybe one of my one of my final

2607
01:42:22,738 --> 01:42:26,879
questions is

2608
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:28,859
are there any types you know

2609
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,659
quote-unquote broad stroking any types

2610
01:42:28,859 --> 01:42:33,719
of genetics that you all would like to

2611
01:42:30,658 --> 01:42:36,299
see more of in your region gold cut do

2612
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:38,219
you wanna anything you can you know that

2613
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:41,520
you you'd think okay people don't know

2614
01:42:38,219 --> 01:42:43,139
about you know this broad family or type

2615
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,400
you know

2616
01:42:43,139 --> 01:42:49,159
um

2617
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:49,158
what would I like to see more here

2618
01:42:51,479 --> 01:42:59,339
stuff that we will keep for many years

2619
01:42:55,399 --> 01:43:01,679
relevant relevant selections or genetics

2620
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:06,539
that have

2621
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:09,300
Canada balanced that uh

2622
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:13,260
not overpowering and not follow

2623
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:16,440
necessary follow the THC percentage hype

2624
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:17,820
because Austria also can you know tend

2625
01:43:16,439 --> 01:43:20,519
to do

2626
01:43:17,819 --> 01:43:24,118
I think that's that's or if this if this

2627
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:27,560
answers the question number two yeah

2628
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:27,559
yeah I appreciate that

2629
01:43:28,198 --> 01:43:33,779
just a lot more diversity man for the

2630
01:43:31,139 --> 01:43:35,760
most part like I'm beginning to see a

2631
01:43:33,779 --> 01:43:37,920
shift that I'm not a massive fan of a

2632
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,980
lot of people leaning into the hype you

2633
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:43,139
know that U.S hype Market is um feeding

2634
01:43:40,979 --> 01:43:44,579
a lot of the mines over here as well so

2635
01:43:43,139 --> 01:43:46,020
a lot of people are you know jumping on

2636
01:43:44,579 --> 01:43:47,340
that bandwagon so yeah man you know

2637
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:49,739
we've got a climate that's conducive to

2638
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:51,119
Growing equatorial [ __ ] that's what I

2639
01:43:49,738 --> 01:43:53,218
want to see a lot more of the the

2640
01:43:51,118 --> 01:43:55,198
sativas so that's why I've been

2641
01:43:53,219 --> 01:43:56,698
conscious of would go by seeds as well

2642
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,319
you know there's probably there's a

2643
01:43:56,698 --> 01:44:00,238
shitload of sativa offerings I mean

2644
01:43:58,319 --> 01:44:02,519
we've got like some white buffalo like

2645
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:05,579
Nepalese and Jamaican and all this kind

2646
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:07,800
of stuff so there's hazes you know I

2647
01:44:05,579 --> 01:44:09,238
learned some stuff through matte you

2648
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:10,679
know we've got the GMO Bonnet there's a

2649
01:44:09,238 --> 01:44:12,118
whole bunch of different long flowering

2650
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:13,618
stuff that I'd like to see grown out

2651
01:44:12,118 --> 01:44:15,539
because um yeah we've got the climate

2652
01:44:13,618 --> 01:44:16,799
for it and it's it's a cool smoke and I

2653
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:18,179
think people haven't really had exposure

2654
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,800
to it that much I think a lot of people

2655
01:44:18,179 --> 01:44:22,139
are geared to that that Indica like

2656
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:23,659
knock you down mindset but yeah there's

2657
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:25,199
this whole other

2658
01:44:23,658 --> 01:44:27,899
cannabis

2659
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:29,759
so yeah just Batman and yeah just you

2660
01:44:27,899 --> 01:44:30,899
know just compassion just people you

2661
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,199
know taking their time thinking through

2662
01:44:30,899 --> 01:44:33,198
things

2663
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:40,198
very nice yeah I mean any anything else

2664
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:43,259
and from any of you like any passing

2665
01:44:40,198 --> 01:44:44,698
thoughts on you know either your region

2666
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:47,360
or anything that you've heard from

2667
01:44:44,698 --> 01:44:47,359
anyone else

2668
01:44:49,139 --> 01:44:52,579
any questions for anyone else

2669
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:57,238
I'm pretty good brother

2670
01:44:55,319 --> 01:44:59,880
because otherwise yeah we can wrap up

2671
01:44:57,238 --> 01:45:02,158
and maybe before we do we just want to

2672
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:03,539
make sure that we plug yeah that was

2673
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:06,658
where I was gonna go

2674
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:08,219
because I mean booze like uh you can

2675
01:45:06,658 --> 01:45:10,319
just mentioned a bit about the seed bank

2676
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:13,079
and the show

2677
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:15,779
yeah yeah I've um so I've got goat by

2678
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:16,979
seeds so that basically started um well

2679
01:45:15,779 --> 01:45:19,019
it sort of leads into everything that

2680
01:45:16,979 --> 01:45:20,638
I've been talking about today I I didn't

2681
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:23,159
have a lot of exposure to good genetics

2682
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,960
until I got into the online scene a bit

2683
01:45:23,158 --> 01:45:27,000
more and through Discord and then

2684
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:29,460
finding out you know Matt and cry baby

2685
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,380
getting their gear and growing it out

2686
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:34,020
um I just wanted you know more people

2687
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:36,060
around me to have access to good gear so

2688
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:37,980
yeah I started goat by seeds I you know

2689
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:40,260
I only stop people that I really feel

2690
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:42,539
their gear you know is on the level

2691
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:43,980
um that I can vouch for and yeah so

2692
01:45:42,539 --> 01:45:46,019
we've got a bunch of cool breeders you

2693
01:45:43,979 --> 01:45:47,519
know that I have been on this show and

bunch of people and yeah I wanted to put

2720

I've learned from you guys so I mean I

2748
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:36,599
don't have to be a regurgitation of your

2749
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:37,800
guys show that's my biggest thing where

2750

2753
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:46,199
what might I talk about even is like my

just I'm just one of the loudest people

2758
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:56,279
in our group and like everybody's agreed

2759
01:47:54,539 --> 01:47:58,380
that they're okay with me doing this you

2760
01:47:56,279 --> 01:48:00,899
know so even what I'm doing is still a

2761
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:03,359
regurgitation of sorts and it's not

2762
01:48:00,899 --> 01:48:05,158
necessarily my information to own or any

2763
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:06,539
of that and like a lot of what you guys

2764
01:48:05,158 --> 01:48:07,979
talk about is totally different from

2765
01:48:06,539 --> 01:48:10,198
what we talk about but it's just as

2766
01:48:07,979 --> 01:48:12,000
relevant and special and from it from an

2767
01:48:10,198 --> 01:48:14,099
amazing perspective from a good dude so

2768
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,479
and and on top of that the seed bank

2769
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:18,480
part like

2770
01:48:15,479 --> 01:48:20,579
all I've ever told anybody any seed bank

2771
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:23,218
whether it was you know bdsc when they

2772
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:28,079
started or any of them

2773
01:48:23,219 --> 01:48:30,239
um was just carry people who are good

2774
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:32,639
good people and it'll go far you don't

2775
01:48:30,238 --> 01:48:34,138
have to carry everyone just I promise

2776
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:36,239
you if you carry good people it'll be so

2777
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:39,060
much less headaches and it'll naturally

2778
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:40,439
form its own base and and you guys are

2779
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:42,480
doing it and that's I think that's

2780
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:43,919
commendable it's hard it's not the easy

2781
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:47,158
route it's not the it's not a money

2782
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,899
maker by any stretch it's necessary it's

2783
01:48:47,158 --> 01:48:50,039
necessary it's helpful and that's that's

2784
01:48:48,899 --> 01:48:51,960
the most important part is that it's

2785
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:53,460
helpful it doesn't it's not hurtful in

2786
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:57,000
my opinion it's not hurtful at all it's

2787
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:59,819
very helpful so yeah I appreciate it I

2788
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,079
appreciate it yeah just my way of giving

2789
01:48:59,819 --> 01:49:03,920
back a little bit to the scene that's

2790
01:49:01,079 --> 01:49:03,920
given me so much

2791
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:09,600
hell yeah man

2792
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:13,800
um and gold cut gold cut also of course

2793
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:16,100
um helps distribute Matt's work right no

2794
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,100
Europe

2795
01:49:16,679 --> 01:49:21,779
yeah we uh we are we are we are still

2796
01:49:19,859 --> 01:49:24,719
still around

2797
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:27,179
um and uh there's a bunch of people who

2798
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:29,579
decided to support us which I find

2799
01:49:27,179 --> 01:49:31,260
amazing about to thank every every

2800
01:49:29,579 --> 01:49:34,439
person out there may be listening to us

2801
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:36,780
right now who supported Matthew's uh uh

2802
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:39,479
introduction more or less because here

2803
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:42,179
in Austria they were not known and I

2804
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:44,638
think also for the German market and or

2805
01:49:42,179 --> 01:49:46,380
a bunch of people in Central Europe I

2806
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,139
haven't heard about it

2807
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:52,020
um I decided to do that and um you know

2808
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:54,000
I think it was a great opportunity to

2809
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:56,400
showcase something that is really

2810
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,340
different to what is around

2811
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:01,019
um we are working on uh getting some of

2812
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:03,179
the British Syndicate stuff over here

2813
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:06,060
because people I'm gonna send over some

2814
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:08,760
of the stuff me and Caleb did

2815
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:11,039
um with more lights people ask a lot you

2816
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:13,079
know people ask for high and loads of

2817
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:14,579
stuff and yeah so you see there's

2818
01:50:13,079 --> 01:50:16,439
there's a bunch of people in Central

2819
01:50:14,579 --> 01:50:18,840
Europe who listen to the previous

2820
01:50:16,439 --> 01:50:22,439
Syndicate podcast and

2821
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:25,260
um or or go to the you know Discord and

2822
01:50:22,439 --> 01:50:26,339
so yeah people want to support this

2823
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:28,739
because they

2824
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:31,139
you know gravitate towards people who

2825
01:50:28,738 --> 01:50:33,539
think they are like-minded and ethical

2826
01:50:31,139 --> 01:50:36,179
background is I think plays a big role

2827
01:50:33,539 --> 01:50:38,460
yeah because that's why I do it you know

2828
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:40,800
that's why I do that's why I you know

2829
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:42,118
like when we talk like I I couldn't

2830
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,579
think of anyone else you could better

2831
01:50:42,118 --> 01:50:46,799
represent everything that I believe in

2832
01:50:44,579 --> 01:50:48,600
Europe that I trust that has a good

2833
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,539
heart um so that's why it's so important

2834
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:54,300
for for him to be a part of this with me

2835
01:50:51,539 --> 01:50:55,920
because yeah and uh it's a hard search

2836
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:58,560
when you find someone like that you hold

2837
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,840
them close you you happen I appreciate

2838
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:03,780
that that's awesome and it gives me it

2839
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:06,480
gives me the chance to to also showcase

2840
01:51:03,779 --> 01:51:08,519
through my work which continues because

2841
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:12,599
