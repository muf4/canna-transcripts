and rickel so uh this is one of the

18
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,859
episodes I've probably been looking

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,960
forward to the most since we started

20
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,879
um and and I'll I'll leave it up to

21
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,739
Magic to kind of start his tale because

22
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,298
I this is one I couldn't possibly begin

23
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,339
to start

24
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,159
um so magic when you started getting

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,380
into growing what was the impetus what

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,820
was the start

27
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,539
hmm

28
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,639
well the start was a friend of mine who

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,220
was a dealer in Tempe

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,319
um weed dealer

31
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,179
he saw all kinds of loads coming through

32
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,699
over the years

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,979
um from the late 60s to uh

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,219
let's say 73 74 and he would high grade

35
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,179
the seeds these were all seeded loads at

36
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,759
first

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,640
um so if you had guerreran or if he had

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,118
oaxacan he would if he found that it was

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,579
a great strain he would keep the seeds

40
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:02,700
and over time he started collecting all

41
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:05,519
these seeds and then one day around 1975

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,618
he said why don't we just gross our own

43
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,699
with these seeds instead of having to

44
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:10,739
deal with

45
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,238
um the support of this stuff so yeah

46
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,700
so we

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,180
um decided to test that theory and

48
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:22,139
that's the very first grow in 1976 I did

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,900
with um him and I went up and found the

50
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,779
spot that we would potentially use in a

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,840
remote Canyon along the Mogan rim

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,959
ogan Rim is spelled like mogulon but

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,300
it's pronounced maggion or mogion and

54
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,819
it's the southernmost edge of the

55
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,280
Colorado Plateau so it stretches from

56
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,979
roughly from Williams Arizona all the

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,439
way to Mogan New Mexico 200 miles wide

58
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,060
this edge of the plateau and along the

59
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,219
edge are all these

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,199
cracks let's call them and they're

61
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,000
they're Canyons with streams year-round

62
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,280
streams there's probably

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,500
I'd say 20 Canyons with year-round

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,979
streams in that 200 miles

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,500
and we chose one of them

66
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:07,079
and and when you decided to choose that

67
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,759
was it because there you knew for a fact

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,040
there was no like real human interaction

69
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,719
there is it just so remote that nobody

70
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,479
was going down there

71
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,300
that's that's pretty much it

72
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:21,139
uh Hunters stay up on top of the plateau

73
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,200
edges and stuff or they're way way down

74
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:26,939
in areas that are easier to ex

75
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,179
more accessible

76
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,699
sure to hike down 1600 feet into a

77
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,099
canyon down a boulder stream wash

78
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,818
through bushes and stuff

79
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,979
um

80
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,359
Hunters wouldn't do it because if they

81
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,199
shoot anything they'd have to carry it

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,379
out and yeah it's just way too remote

83
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,060
and the criteria was we wanted it had to

84
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:49,859
have a year-round stream

85
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,319
so we had to make sure that it was

86
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,940
flowing in the heart of the summer

87
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,759
and

88
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,979
um a Jeep Trail dirt road that led close

89
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,019
to it so we wouldn't have to hike more

90
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,119
than maybe two hours one way

91
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,340
yeah and then

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,560
um we began testing it in different ways

93
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,200
I I'd have my friend who was the dealer

94
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,878
from Tempe walk around down below while

95
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,579
I was up on the rim and we had

96
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,978
walkie-talkies back then this is pretty

97
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,340
cell phone so

98
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,019
um you just you know I I just go oh I

99
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,000
can see you you're wearing a white

100
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,478
T-shirt

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,300
so that was that had to change and then

102
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,279
he had a straw hat that had to change

103
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,259
um just can't be doing those things if

104
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,099
you're in the bottom of the canyon and

105
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:41,819
yeah Cowboys ranchers still use these

106
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,220
areas back in the early 70s they were uh

107
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,339
they were grazing cows there even though

108
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,400
it was National Forest the forest would

109
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:53,039
was allowing them I think their their

110
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,219
permits go back to the 1920s or 30s or

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,520
40s and they just allowed them to uh

112
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,120
continue on and they got Tighter and

113
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,859
Tighter and then eventually by oh let's

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,939
see

115
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,540
late

116
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,519
late 70s they stopped all the grazing in

117
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,740
these areas in this particular area

118
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,740
which was great yeah yeah

119
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,519
a canyon away

120
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:24,240
um some guys from Jerome were growing

121
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:26,099
and they parked there every week week

122
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,319
after week after week at the end of a

123
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,820
Jeep Trail and finally the ranch are

124
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,918
using that area called the forest

125
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,899
service and they came out and ran the

126
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,939
plates and found oh wow they're from

127
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,659
Jerome the hippie capital of Northern

128
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:42,719
Arizona so that it was their scene

129
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,280
yet and they didn't wait for them they

130
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,919
just they didn't want to go down inside

131
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,138
in case you know it would become a

132
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,939
shootout or something so they waited

133
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,400
till they harvested it and took it all

134
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,100
back to Jerome and then they busted on a

135
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,138
Jerome it was like 100 pounds

136
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,879
oh no and they didn't have any effect on

137
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,060
you guys

138
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:06,180
no it it bothered us because they were

139
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,538
within five miles by air of where we

140
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,000
were but it's so remote and so difficult

141
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:14,279
they chose a canyon that was a lot

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,839
better known and people were known for

143
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,899
hiking through it and swimming through

144
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,519
it because it was very long had sections

145
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:25,560
of wall-to-wall water you had to swim

146
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:28,139
our Cannon was unknown and you couldn't

147
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,879
hike down from the top because there was

148
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,019
a spot we called

149
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,459
um

150
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:37,019
oh what land not Lands End the Hall of

151
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,779
the Mountain King is what we called it

152
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,060
it was a hundred foot waterfall drop off

153
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,159
and you can't you couldn't you couldn't

154
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,199
go down it so we never had to worry

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
about anyone hiking Downstream from

156
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,520
where it started as a watch five miles

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,919
away

158
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,939
so how did you guys hide in did you guys

159
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,560
go in a certain way that that made it

160
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,418
accessible enough obviously for you guys

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,478
but other people didn't know

162
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:07,139
yep we drove Five Mile Jeep Trail

163
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:09,000
the first well this first time with my

164
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,478
friend from Tempe it was about a three

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,459
mile Jeep Trail and then maybe a

166
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:18,538
thousand foot drop off down into the

167
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:21,000
canyon and it it was a canyon that at

168
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:24,060
the top was heavily used by swimmers and

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,279
and people who were into

170
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,160
um Crystal Clear Pools and things like

171
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,439
that but the lower part where we were

172
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,259
um there was no one we never left

173
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,959
Footprints either we these beautiful

174
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,240
sand bars that are long creeks and edges

175
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,159
we would just avoid them because we knew

176
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,538
that if anyone did hike through that's

177
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,939
the first place they would walk because

178
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,560
it was easier so we could always check

179
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,779
for footprints

180
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,120
and our primary Canyon magic Canyon

181
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,519
which came the next year

182
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,598
um in five years we only saw one set of

183
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,258
footprints

184
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,060
wow ironically my partner

185
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,220
picked up a hitchhiker on the way back

186
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,680
to the nearest town and he was the guy

187
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,139
who had hiked through there so we we

188
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,379
found out he he was all excited because

189
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,660
he had hiked this 12 Mile Canyon and saw

190
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,860
nobody and he had hiked right by our

191
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,680
Gardens and never knew it you know

192
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,759
yeah so that was good karma

193
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,740
meeting the guy

194
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,479
what I what I find so interesting when I

195
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,180
was when I was reading a little bit

196
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:32,038
about your your history and stuff is how

197
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,479
similar

198
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,218
um although although a little bit

199
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,959
different just due to geography like

200
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,060
when I first moved to Mendocino County

201
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,038
and we were doing gorilla before the

202
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,158
medical era really started

203
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,139
uh was how similar the criteria was

204
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,360
and that you were looking for somewhere

205
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,639
very remote

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,919
inaccessible uh normal people hikers

207
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,319
Hunters various people would never go

208
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:58,079
there but you needed water

209
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,480
uh and you couldn't really take a

210
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,980
vehicle up there or even like dirt bikes

211
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,300
or anything because you never wanted to

212
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,920
leave a trail that would have been

213
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,919
visible from the air

214
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,419
so you would only get so so close and

215
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,879
then the rest of it was sort of hoofing

216
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,500
it in and even hoofing it in from like

217
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,958
different angles so that you wouldn't

218
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,879
create a path in summer

219
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,338
that would be visible

220
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,620
was that can I uh let me interject a

221
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:26,640
question were they flying looking for

222
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,240
weed then or was that too early for that

223
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,100
um it was too early they there were

224
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,440
there were people who talked about that

225
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,200
that going on but we never saw that

226
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,899
happen we did have a helicopter land in

227
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,180
our Canyon in the only spot that was

228
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,120
wide enough this is another weird one

229
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:48,539
and their tracks went about the tracks

230
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,179
from the helicopter went about 400 yards

231
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:54,120
down the canyon stopped and then went

232
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:56,639
back and we thought we were dreaming

233
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,980
because we didn't see the helicopter we

234
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,379
just saw these tracks and we followed

235
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,759
them to this little opening but when we

236
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,958
got down on our knees and looked

237
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,439
carefully

238
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:10,859
little frag little pieces of paint had

239
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,080
had chipped off the helicopters

240
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,839
um I forget one of those the skids let's

241
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,639
call them yeah and left on the Rocks

242
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,760
because this volcanic rock so it's very

243
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,338
sharp so we knew we were hallucinating

244
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:26,039
in a helicopter had landed there and

245
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:30,360
later we found out it was Eagle studiers

246
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:32,219
oh from the University in in we're not

247
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,959
sure which university but they were

248
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,300
checking out all the Canyons up there

249
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,039
and and getting out and Hiking if they

250
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:43,019
saw eagles and trying to get some

251
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:46,078
numbers for their studies so we we felt

252
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,759
okay but the the actual looking for

253
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,359
plants

254
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:54,720
um you know if you were to open if you

255
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,639
were to like clear a huge wide area and

256
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,778
leave it open and then just start

257
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,578
growing

258
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:01,740
such that you could stand on the edge of

259
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:02,819
a canyon and look down in and go hey

260
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,940
what's that

261
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,800
um that would be bad yeah so you have to

262
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,760
go in and out between the bushes make

263
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,578
little

264
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:15,000
patties that flowed from one to the next

265
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:16,259
level and work it out and then later we

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,659
even found out

267
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:21,659
it made sense because we were up on the

268
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:25,139
rim looking down after

269
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,600
watering and the reflection on the mud

270
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:30,299
was very obvious that this was an area

271
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,000
that had gotten water so every time we

272
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:35,039
watered which was once a week we spread

273
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,839
oak leaves and whatever leaves were

274
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,599
there we started piling them up in

275
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,100
advance and just threw them on top and

276
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,000
totally stopped the reflection

277
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,820
a lot of things

278
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,639
we painted all of our hose connections

279
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,100
with brown spray flat

280
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,879
sure spray paint so it wouldn't reflect

281
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,540
uh we never wore white t-shirts or hats

282
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,939
um

283
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:02,639
we we had this photo that you have up

284
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,040
right now that's my first my second part

285
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,100
he's my first partner in Magic because

286
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,338
the guy I started with who's the dealer

287
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,040
we um went separate ways kind of because

288
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,260
he didn't he lived in Tempe and it was

289
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,199
just wasn't feasible for him to come up

290
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,838
and do this every week so I lived in the

291
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,560
Verde Valley which I was still over an

292
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,720
hour away but it made more sense and

293
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,838
this fellow that you see here was my

294
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,240
first partner he lived in flag and

295
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,180
this is what the creek looked like

296
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,919
year-round water this Pond right here is

297
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,620
what we pumped out of

298
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,078
and our first Garden was 90 feet

299
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,259
above the the creek level

300
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,059
so we used a Briggs and Stratton four

301
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:51,659
horsepower

302
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:55,138
um two inch fire hose

303
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,539
and if it was it wouldn't pump up 90

304
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:02,399
feet so yeah you had to drop down to a

305
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:07,019
garden hose adapter that it forced it up

306
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,559
to 90 feet we just appreciated yeah

307
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,419
um

308
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,099
there's different pumps we could have

309
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,500
gotten for more money like six

310
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,980
horsepower that weighed 150 pounds or

311
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,139
something and uh yeah but we we it

312
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,480
worked so it took two hours that first

313
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,240
Garden to just move the hose around we

314
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,759
only had one hose and we'd just move it

315
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,700
in subsequent years we created um

316
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:33,740
systems of hoses so you just you know

317
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,740
they all just watered

318
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,799
those filled up little patties and then

319
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,839
those

320
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,479
pour it over onto the next level and to

321
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,399
the next level because the the train was

322
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,620
relatively flat on these alluvial

323
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,220
plateaus but you know maybe a foot or

324
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:53,700
two of of differences plus we we raked

325
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,040
it and leveled it and used rocks to to

326
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,278
outline little patties so that maybe

327
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:00,958
there'd be two or three plants yeah on a

328
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,759
Patty and then the next one would be

329
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,119
next to it it would drop off

330
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,879
we have free hoses though too uh that

331
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,100
were on Siamese shutoffs and we could

332
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,320
open them up and then you know spot hit

333
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,480
other plants and yeah it worked pretty

334
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,000
well we spent a lot of time developing

335
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,210
our hose Network on subsequent years

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,679
sounds like after that first

337
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:26,100
[Music]

338
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,479
you know Matt magic this is rajo so just

339
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,120
I want to jump in there you know you're

340
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,959
talking about all these gorilla

341
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,519
um

342
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,679
tactics

343
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,778
and you know this is back in the 70s

344
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,519
you're talking about could when you were

345
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,278
when you were doing all this stuff was

346
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,078
any of this kind of inspired by the war

347
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,019
that we had just finished fighting in

348
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,879
Vietnam and you know the everything that

349
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,019
we used to hear on the news all the time

350
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,419
about

351
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:54,000
the Guerrilla Fighters over there and

352
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,799
how they concealed what they did I know

353
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,240
that when I was doing my gorilla stuff

354
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,399
it was

355
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,980
you know I'm listening to your stories

356
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,740
and it's exactly like what I did except

357
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,839
my stuff was all green and not not rock

358
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,299
you know

359
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,720
but uh where where was your inspiration

360
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,719
for

361
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,260
the whole catalog

362
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,000
yeah the written word has always been my

363
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:22,139
guide and

364
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,399
um

365
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,139
this is

366
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,440
um

367
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:31,620
domestic Growers Supply catalog from

368
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,720
1981 1980 and

369
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,039
I read about this in the whole earth

370
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,899
catalog and I I wrote in a way for it

371
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,000
look at these waterbed

372
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,320
classical tanks to fit in the back of

373
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,480
your truck so you can pull up to the

374
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,720
edge of a canyon and I knew people who

375
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,420
use this method then it's all

376
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,699
gravity feed downhill for 600 feet to

377
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:56,939
their spot and

378
00:15:53,698 --> 00:16:00,359
um this this is a small little thing

379
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:03,420
small little catalog it as but it does

380
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,079
have a very nice section on

381
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:10,620
on pumps and

382
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:13,039
these guys I don't know once we started

383
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:17,278
making their second catalog in color

384
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:19,679
1982 and they were based out of I think

385
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:23,578
Oregon let's see where this is

386
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:27,479
um but they have all kinds of

387
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:29,519
guzzler pumps hand operated

388
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,600
um where you just that wouldn't work for

389
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,539
us but

390
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,199
yeah we've had a few times where

391
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:39,480
things broke and we had to Water by hand

392
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:43,578
using five gallon jugs dipping them in

393
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,159
the watering them it takes

394
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:49,559
but but you you can't neglect it because

395
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,659
you're there to water and oh it was good

396
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,359
the way we did it

397
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,240
we were fortunate because one week

398
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,339
we would flood irrigate we estimated in

399
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,959
subsequent years that we were putting 20

400
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:05,939
000 gallons on

401
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:07,859
on our little gardens so that was it in

402
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,959
this soft dirt that we used it would

403
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:13,198
sink nice and deep and then the roots

404
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,360
would follow it oh yeah it's but you

405
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,179
couldn't go two weeks if you went like

406
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,279
even 10 days which we tried to do a few

407
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,140
times you'd come back and all the plants

408
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,000
were wilted and drooping and heard

409
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,939
freaked out because we thought we had

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,439
messed up and we went ahead and watered

411
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,860
the next morning everything was standing

412
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:34,620
up perfect and looking beautiful

413
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:37,079
they're amazing plants how they can be

414
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,079
almost shriveled and then one water

415
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:42,899
resistant or just yeah did you ever use

416
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:46,500
any like uh any water retention crystals

417
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,240
or anything like that to extend

418
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,579
um because that was that was some that

419
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,079
was some technique that it you know like

420
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:53,759
by the time that I got to Mendocino

421
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,519
County and started doing stuff like that

422
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,900
there was our already a lot of like I

423
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,179
don't know if you want to call it Hill

424
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,820
Tech or older people that were passing

425
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,860
down how to get away with things

426
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,259
um infrequent watering was always well

427
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:08,699
how do you retain the water how do you

428
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:10,558
how do you keep it how do you keep

429
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,980
things wet when you're only checking on

430
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:18,480
things every so often

431
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,900
so our Canyon was 12 miles long and we

432
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,120
we hiked it up and down to find the two

433
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,700
spots that we this was the first spot

434
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,558
that's on the camera right now but the

435
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,538
other two spots we found were up Canyon

436
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,599
and

437
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:36,119
we you just don't come across alluvial

438
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,399
plateaus at water level they're up at

439
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,918
least 20 feet above and

440
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,900
we had to scramble up and look and

441
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,220
scramble up and we'd be up in the room

442
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,600
and look down and say hey that looks

443
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,279
like a good spot and then go back the

444
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,038
next week and check it but when we

445
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,220
finally found our two spots

446
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:56,819
um this soil is wind deposited over

447
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,400
centuries and decades and multitudes and

448
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:02,460
it was so nice there was rocks in there

449
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,340
big boulders as you can see here but in

450
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,860
this our very first place down below

451
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,000
here is where that photo was taken

452
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,119
and

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,119
this is at almost at Harvest you can see

454
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,959
the size of the coal is beautiful and

455
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,839
um

456
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,900
we um the soil was just this beautiful

457
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:25,199
Rich volcanic soil although when Robert

458
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:28,798
Clark came down in the second year of

459
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,440
our new location not this one he said he

460
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,179
couldn't believe we were growing in dirt

461
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,880
and I said what do you mean the dirt and

462
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:39,059
he said well in Mendocino and up in

463
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,120
North it's not dirt like this it's soil

464
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:45,480
like black rich soil and ours was brown

465
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:48,359
and gray and just dirt but yeah it was

466
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,400
easy to shovel so that meant the water

467
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,819
penetrated it and so did Roots very

468
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,759
easily we turned the soil down 18 inches

469
00:19:53,819 --> 00:20:00,000
I think and the only amendment we ever

470
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,640
added were bone meal and blood meal oh

471
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,339
wow that was it we didn't have to do a

472
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,980
folio story and the foliar spray saved

473
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:10,619
us from this twisting Leaf thing that we

474
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,500
it was a micronutrient that was missing

475
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:16,379
we think it was molybdenum but we uh

476
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,839
sprayed the plants and it saved our

477
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,000
butts because they all untwisted

478
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,639
no it's nice but that's it

479
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,460
just so when you were when you were let

480
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,038
me ask a question in terms of

481
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,900
um when did the growing season like when

482
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,599
were you when was it nice enough outside

483
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:37,259
that you were able to plant and how much

484
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:39,779
work did you do to prep in the winter

485
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,460
spring off Seasons like you said you

486
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,859
turned the soil and you had to run all

487
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,500
these hoses and prep all this different

488
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:48,599
stuff how much pregame went into like

489
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,640
preparing the areas you were thinking

490
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,579
about using

491
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,020
we had November and December and January

492
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:56,579
off and then we were back out in

493
00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:00,179
February

494
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:02,579
um we you know preparing

495
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:05,038
we we started small like this Garden

496
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:08,159
here you're looking at in this boat is

497
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,740
probably 100 feet by 50 feet with

498
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,440
Boulders and trees and stuff in it it

499
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,319
it's it Blended in pretty well even from

500
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,160
the Italian did really well yeah

501
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:23,819
however the next Garden we used was

502
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,500
three times the size of this and if we

503
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:27,000
plant it in between bushes and trees

504
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,980
which you'll I'm sure you've seen in

505
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,859
some of the photos and

506
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,500
but when there were no plants those

507
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:36,839
between the bushes and trees were the

508
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,000
patties were I'm just calling them that

509
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,038
we had to build up with rocks and have

510
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,720
it spill over to the next Garden in the

511
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,359
next or in the next Patty and the next

512
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,659
one but we had free hoses too to be able

513
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,519
to walk around and in water with

514
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,520
it took

515
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,740
I don't know months of perhaps the very

516
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,940
first time because we had to bring down

517
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,640
so much stuff and then the third year we

518
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,320
grew we did two gardens that was The Big

519
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,559
Year and that's the year that Rob Clark

520
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:11,519
came down to see he he only came down to

521
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:14,279
see the one easiest to reach garden and

522
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:18,119
in this this photo is kind of an early

523
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:20,899
photo of that first Garden yeah these

524
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,219
are little tiny pipes in here in these

525
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,159
let's see if we can get actually that

526
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,860
that first Garden was so was that

527
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,020
primarily uh different different types

528
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:33,599
of Mexican that your dealer friend had

529
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:36,918
collected was that was that the primary

530
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,918
seed stock for the first season

531
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,780
I mean you were saying stuff about

532
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:45,179
oaxacan I believe and some other things

533
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:47,759
is there any Colombian and stuff

534
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:50,460
yeah but the first year we just grew the

535
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:53,519
Mexican strains and it was in this other

536
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,579
Canyon that people actually went to the

537
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,918
top of it and would swim there but

538
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:02,220
our Canyon

539
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:05,280
we didn't start till my partner that you

540
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,440
saw down there next to the water

541
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,298
that I'll hold it right here if you

542
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,298
could hold that one but which one the

543
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,400
last one or this one yeah the last photo

544
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:15,960
okay

545
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,960
I was trying to jump through this one

546
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,179
that one this one you can see how they

547
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,940
stand out

548
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:26,759
yeah definitely the canvas

549
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:30,538
The Evergreens here were giant Pines and

550
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:32,400
small shrub oak trees and bushes

551
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:35,940
but from the rim

552
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,220
it didn't look too too blocky you know

553
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,960
they were scattered out if you really

554
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,120
knew what you were looking for yeah you

555
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,880
would have spotted this from 1600 feet

556
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,219
above but no one really went to those

557
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,720
edges in those Canyons this was not and

558
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,880
especially when it's 100 degrees out

559
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,440
yeah

560
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,860
it it was difficult so this is just I'd

561
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,259
say this is one half of this Garden it

562
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:03,899
extends over here and over here and this

563
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,058
was only 30 feet above above the creek

564
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,740
but it was in the spot that we you would

565
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:11,038
never expect it and we hiked up there

566
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,259
and went holy cow this is perfect so we

567
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,319
were able to pump two inches of water in

568
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,298
a two inch fire hose up to this flat and

569
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,639
that's why we put about 20 000 gallons

570
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:23,879
on here every week

571
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,620
and so wild do you mind the stories how

572
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,220
old you were

573
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:32,399
I was 28. 28.

574
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,100
yep 28 and 29 and 30. when we were doing

575
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,500
these three can these three Gardens that

576
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:39,719
you're seeing here yeah I

577
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,200
my partner was the same age we were all

578
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,480
just you know late 20s or in right

579
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,519
around 30 when we started doing this in

580
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,740
76 though I was only 25. mm-hmm

581
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:56,460
are you are you still in contact with

582
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,558
any of the other guys all of them said

583
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,620
they're all still with us that's awesome

584
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,058
that's freaking awesome yeah the the

585
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:05,158
relatively speaking the dealer from

586
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:05,819
Tempe has

587
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,179
um

588
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:10,079
what's that disease he's now in a

589
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,679
wheelchair

590
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,439
after 15 years he made it 15 years

591
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:19,559
multiple of sclerosis

592
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,140
Ms yeah yeah so he's kind of restricted

593
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,480
another partner who was the very last

594
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,860
one I worked with he was a friend we all

595
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,960
knew each other

596
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,899
independently I mean it was great

597
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,440
because we're all originally friends

598
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:39,600
um he um has early onset Alzheimer's

599
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:43,038
he's 70 and he he has great um long-term

600
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,599
memory but he can't drive a car he yeah

601
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:49,019
I think he doesn't remember where he is

602
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:52,319
within a block so he's restricted but my

603
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:55,019
first partner that you saw there in

604
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:58,439
Magic came down by the water he he's

605

606
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,159
and

607
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,679
um he's still around and I I see him

608
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,440

609
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,600

616
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:30,200
in all of the characters but it's more

617
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:34,079
about A Love Affair he had

618
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:38,038
at the time and it's um pretty funny

619
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,839
it's he he got an honorable mention in

620
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,240

already that's going to be more factual

625
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,460
might that'll be great my my pilot

626
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,179
friend who

627
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,940
he's in the chronicle I wrote called

628
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,820
um I know the guy who knows the guy yeah

629
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,679
he I just talked to him a few days ago

630
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:10,980
he called me because he just fell and

631
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,740
broke his hip and I was going to invite

632
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,960
him to be on this show but

633
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,460
um he's in the hospital in Anchorage

634
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,919
Alaska now

635
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,620
I know bizarre so the universe didn't

636
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,679
want that to happen and I had kind of

637
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:29,519
thought he wouldn't want to he

638
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,798
he makes Mr Nice look small I I can

639
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,200
we'll go into his story later if you

640
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:37,319
don't mind yeah I'd love to the last

641
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,640
time I saw him physically in 1985 until

642
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,460
last year

643
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,538
they were just working on 60 tons of

644
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:49,860
hashish from Pakistan and this is the

645
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:52,919
level he worked at and he retired never

646
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:57,178
was busted that's incredible you know he

647
00:27:52,919 --> 00:28:00,778
I know it's it's amazing but if you knew

648
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:02,700
him this is why I I was so intent on

649
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:04,500
getting this show because I think you

650
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,620
know we talk about a lot of the people

651
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,538
who who we I yeah who've been put on a

652
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,399
pedestal in our scene um I mean of

653
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:13,740
course Sam the skunk man Rob Clark

654
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,600
amazing people obviously deserve their

655
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,740
accolades I mean the big heroes in the

656
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,319
scene

657
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:23,099
um but there's some guys who did some

658
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:26,460
really big bold stuff that don't quite

659
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,778
get seen for many reasons uh a lot of it

660
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,640
has to do with the fact that it was

661
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:31,500
clandestine and illegal and it's in some

662
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,179
folks don't even still want to talk

663
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,798
about it but there are some amazing

664
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,140
Stories out there that I've come across

665
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,240
over the years and years was one and

666
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,759
speaking to someone that you were able

667
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,740
to bring with you um raho I wanted to

668
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,119
get into a little bit with you raho can

669
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,759
you talk about when you first started

670
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,439
collecting and getting into growing yeah

671
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,339
sure Matt

672
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,500
um

673
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:55,379
it's uh

674
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,679
man it seems like so long ago you know I

675
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,720
was just a kid uh 78 was the first time

676
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,640
I smoked weed and

677
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,100
back then you had to smoke you know

678
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,679
three four five times before you ever

679
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:11,099
actually felt the effect I don't know if

680
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,500
it was because the concentration of THC

681
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:16,319
wasn't so you know as high as it is

682
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,898
today or maybe

683
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,658
um the stuff that kids could buy on the

684
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:24,839
street back then wasn't so great but uh

685
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:28,020
you know by the time by the time

686
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:31,199
I got high that very first time you know

687
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:33,179
I was 15 years old uh after school at a

688
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,740
buddy's house and

689
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,980
um

690
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,259
you know we it took a while to kick in

691
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,019
and

692
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:45,298
after I was I was actually riding my

693
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:48,359
bike home thinking oh you know another

694
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:51,058
time that it didn't work when it started

695
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:54,418
to hit me right and it was a beautiful

696
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:56,759
spring day the sun was out you know the

697
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,759
air was just it was one of those days

698
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:02,339
where the air was crisp and it was the

699
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,619
temperature was perfect you know I'm

700
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,658
cranking away on this 10-speed bike and

701
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:08,639
the wind is blowing in my face and all

702
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:11,220
of a sudden I kind of noticed that the

703
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,799
the air and the light and everything is

704
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,319
just kind of alive and the the feeling

705
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,839
of the the wind and the air circulating

706
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,178
around me and in my face and everything

707
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:22,980
just became

708
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:25,440
um you know it was like it was like I

709
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,380
was connected with everything around me

710
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,980
and it was a just a wonderful experience

711
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:34,799
and you know I get I get home

712
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,720
and I put on uh I put on some music

713
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,700
because I'm really cranking at this

714
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,899
point right it's it's really kicking and

715
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:45,899
I'm like wow you know I mean I I drank I

716
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:48,298
drank plenty of beer and and you know

717
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:51,058
but this was nothing like it you know

718
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:53,179
and uh I put on these headphones and

719

720
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:59,460
right

721
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:01,859
wide open cranked up and it's like you

722
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,798

and uh oh my God the heightened senses

725
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:13,519
and all of it going with it yes

726
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,199
how old were you Rojo

727
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,058
15.

728
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,440
you never do when I was listening to

729
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,879
that it sounds like you had your very

730
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,679
own Bicycle Day

731
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
uh because that's what happened to

732
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,340
Albert Hoffman when he first took lsds

733
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,259
he didn't know that's gonna work yeah

734
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:30,538
and he got on a bike and started going

735
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:32,220
around and all sudden colors and wind

736
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:34,740
and he's like what's going on I'm

737
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,519
starting to feel something unusual

738
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,519
and yeah

739
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:43,459
wow I had no idea man that's uh that was

740
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:46,740
awesome

741
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,600
today they call it bicycle day uh

742
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,460
because he took acid accidentally and

743
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:52,379
then he hopped in his bike and he and he

744
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,759
started you know riding around and all

745
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,140
of a sudden things started altering on

746
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,058
him and he really wasn't sure what was

747
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,159
happening he thought it was the most

748
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:00,599
beautiful experience he'd ever had and

749
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,100
wanted to give it to everyone it was

750
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,658
kind of similar to what you just said it

751
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:06,658
was that's what made me think of it

752
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:09,059
colors and the wind and you were very in

753
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,620
tune with nature and like you're riding

754
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:14,158
your bike it just kind of triggered that

755
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:16,019
for me of uh yes of your your headspace

756
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,620
changed and all of a sudden the world

757
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,759
was born anew so it was yeah that's

758
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,879
amazing

759
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:27,179
um what I mean to to share that

760
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,778
experience or or similar right with uh

761
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:33,179
with such a famous man pretty cool great

762
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:34,859
story dude um so you know I mean that

763
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:38,820
was that was the first time getting high

764
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:41,579
and um as soon as I came down you know

765
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:44,339
and Mom and Dad came home from work and

766
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:46,139
I'm like God can they tell you know of

767
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:48,058
course yeah and dinner's prepared and

768
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,700
everything it's you know and it's

769
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:52,740
starting to reflect on what's

770
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,080
you know what's what's happened to me

771
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,919
and I realized that you know the last

772
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:01,678
seven years of my life that I've been

773
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,860
told these things in school about drugs

774
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,840
are bad you know they're they're evil

775
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:08,939
and they'll make you want to jump off of

776
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,819
a building because you think you can fly

777
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,000
or you'll be violent or you know you'll

778
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:17,939
immediately be addicted and fiending for

779
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,798
more and you know I mean it was just all

780
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,620
of a sudden I just started questioning

781
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:25,679
everything I'd ever been told by the by

782
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:28,558
the authorities you know

783
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,500
um because they lied about this and if

784
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:34,440
they lied about that what else did they

785
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:37,380
lie about you know yeah um

786
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,100
so you know almost as every every bag of

787
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,840
weed that that I got after that and

788
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:45,480
there were many right because that was

789
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,359
the beginning and and uh of course and

790
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,940
you know I've never never been the same

791
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:53,479
but every bag came with seeds back then

792
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,480
yeah

793
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,419
that's right you know two fingers

794
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:59,418
foreign

795
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:05,759
two fingers for a quarter one finger for

796
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:08,039
a dime bag you know

797
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,500
half ounces it's just you know simple

798
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,779
math but there were plenty of seeds in

799
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,179
it and you know where I lived um you

800
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,280
know in the Southeast it was mostly

801
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,460
Colombian that we saw I know I know

802
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,159
magic you know they got lots of Mexican

803
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,740
out there and he was very close to to

804
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:29,338
where it came from and everything but

805
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,378
for us you know buying kids buying weed

806
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:34,079
on the street it was it was commercial

807
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:36,960
Colombian most of the time and you know

808
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:42,179
it was just loaded with seeds so

809
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:45,780
um the the very next year in uh 79 I I

810
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,940
tried to grow my first garden and uh

811
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,800
you know I had a tray full of sprouts

812
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,780
I've been gardening with my mom ever

813
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,179
since I was a little kid you know in the

814
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,300
vegetable garden

815
00:34:53,179 --> 00:35:00,059
tomatoes and cucumbers and watermelons

816
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,580
and you name it right but growing uh

817
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:04,679
growing weed was just another Garden

818
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:07,858
thing for me and

819
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,960
um so I got them to sprout and I think I

820
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:12,239
might even use the paper towel method

821
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,519
you know I mean

822
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,959
um because after I started smoking and I

823
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,380
immediately discovered High Times

824
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,000
magazine and it became a monthly ritual

825
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,519
of going down to the bookstore and

826
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,460
picking it up and that was at the the

827
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:29,519
beginning of High Times yeah

828
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:32,280
76 77 75 uh yeah so it had been around

829
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,239
for a few years I mean for the first

830
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,000
year

831
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:38,338
there you go yeah

832
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,500
um and uh but you know I took those

833
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:42,960
sprouts and I put them out in the in the

834
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,820
bright full sunlight you know that I

835
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,920
started them indoors under a little

836
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,960
fluorescent light and I and I put them

837
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,639
with no hardening at all under the sun

838
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,338
and I went out the next day and they

839
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,598
were all dead and that was the end of

840
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:59,460
you know year one

841
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:01,200
total failure you know

842
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,079
um the next year I came back and I hit

843
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,759
it pretty hard and uh me and me and a

844
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,380
couple of friends of mine yeah how are

845
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,839
your parents with this

846
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,500
you know that's a great question

847
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,099
um just amazingly open-minded about it

848
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,880
um

849
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,880
you know

850
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:23,940
um it's at one point maybe it was 81 I

851
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,240
think I started I started breeding I had

852
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:30,539
picked up uh Rob Clark's

853
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:32,759
um marijuana botany marijuana botany and

854
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:35,159
it was just so inspiring you know I mean

855
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,900
it it really everything just clicked as

856
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:41,819
far as the science of breeding and and

857
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:45,420
the way that he described you know

858
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:48,180
genetics and and selection and creating

859
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,159
hybrids and everything it all it was all

860
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:52,858
so intuitive to me it all just made

861
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,199
complete and total sense so I

862
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,159
immediately wanted to make my own seeds

863
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,098
and

864
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,118
start breeding and uh you know that

865
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,059
meant

866
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,400
of course you know we we wanted smoke

867
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:09,440
too so I we needed to segregate the

868
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:15,000
males and I wound up bringing these male

869
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:17,280
uh Indica plants into my parents house

870
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,400
um you know I mean I had these things in

871
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,380
the dining room in the window

872
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,858
um just stinking you know I don't know

873
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:28,200
how I know how they put up with it so my

874
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:31,319
my mom's going now so I can't

875
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,838
I can't again after that yeah I I have a

876
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,480
question for you so it sounds like

877
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,858
um you know obviously he's you know he's

878
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,338
messing with wahawkin and different

879
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:43,259
things from Mexico you know Arizona and

880
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:45,420
the and New Mexico and that are not that

881
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,220
much different climate but if you're in

882
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,619
the southeast of the United States and

883
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:51,598
you're getting mostly Colombian when you

884
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:53,400
that second year where you didn't kill

885
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,859
your seedlings and you got a lot farther

886
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,358
down the path did you hit a point where

887
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,578
you were like are these ever gonna

888
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,799
finish

889
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:05,820
that's a great question so um you know

890
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,640
that second year uh we had a neighbor

891
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,880
across the street had pulled in a

892
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,039
harvest in 79

893
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,660
um one of one of the one of his friends

894
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:22,259
had gone to Maui for Christmas

895
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:26,219
and had come back with seeds of what I

896
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:30,300
know now was Maui wow in 79.

897
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:33,539
um and he grew they grew a big patch of

898
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,700
that stuff uh and it was it was wide

899
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:39,179
Leaf it was you know I know today that

900
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:41,759
it was uh it was Mexican and and some

901
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:44,098
sort of Indica hybrid

902
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,760
um you know it finished early it had

903
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:50,160
amazing taste and um being a poor kid

904
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,680
that cut lawns for money

905
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,379
um luckily half of their crop was seeded

906
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:58,319
and they sold me the seeded stuff for

907
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,380
cheap because nobody wanted it yeah

908
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,140
so back then nobody wanted seeded weed

909
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,420
well you know I mean everything was

910
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:09,358
seated you know sure when you when half

911
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,880
your crop is is seedless and they made

912
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,098
t-shirts you know that said sins and

913
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,019
they were they were so you know yeah

914
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,000
yeah yeah they were I'd love to see some

915
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:19,739
of those today I I you know I'm such a

916
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,320
nerd for all the old vintage [ __ ] like

917
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:23,939
if you've ever seen one let me know you

918
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,400
know it's it's amazing you know kids

919
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,559
immediately turn into you know these

920
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,680
instant entrepreneurs when they wind up

921
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,900
with with you know a bedroom full of

922
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,659
weed hanging from the ceiling that's for

923
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,000
sure you know it's just all of a sudden

924
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:41,098
you know it turns into well all my

925
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,099
friends are gonna want this so how much

926
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:46,320
am I going to charge for it yep and uh

927
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,300
you know also you got lucky in the sense

928
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,300
that you got a hybrid that would

929
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:54,119
actually finish in your area

930
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:57,119
yeah because yeah I always had this idea

931
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:01,200
and I'm I'm obviously like in 19 when

932
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:04,200
you guys are speaking of 1975 77 78 I

933
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:06,899
was still happily in diapers that's

934
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:08,519
definitely not my my part but I always

935
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,800
thought that like maybe the first

936
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,259
American breeding was you're getting

937
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,180
this import from Thailand and Colombia

938
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,099
and Panama and all that and you're like

939
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,719
well how the hell do I get this to

940
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:21,000
finish where I'm at

941
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,739
maybe make this Mexican and I can

942
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,320
shorten it up some because this Mexican

943
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:27,659
seems to be quicker but you're exactly

944
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,940
right yeah this tie in this Colombian is

945
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,858
taking a million years and it's getting

946
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,440
cold and it's getting rainy and my stuff

947
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:37,980
doesn't even look like it's done yeah so

948
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,139
I mean that that Maui was was only part

949
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,900
of the crop that we did that year you

950
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:47,098
know it was um we we also had a Mexican

951
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:49,440
and we had we had a couple of Colombians

952
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:52,200
um you know it was

953
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,159
and all my friends were growing at that

954
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:58,019
point right so you know uh everybody had

955
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,819
a couple of plants out in the woods and

956
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:01,858
we'd go to a party on Friday night

957
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,900
somebody's parents were out of town and

958
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:06,059
sometimes they'd walk you out behind the

959
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,680
house and you know into the woods behind

960
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,719
their house and there'd be a little six

961
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,539
foot Colombian

962
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:14,578
um Christmas tree in a in an opening in

963
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:16,920
in the woods behind their house you know

964
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:19,680
just a just a little hole in the canopy

965
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,838
where the sun came in and

966
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,578
um yeah so those Colombians you know

967
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,920
they would they would

968
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,140
we didn't we never really finished them

969
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,720
as as we know you know what you know

970
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:32,699
resin glands and yeah proper finish

971
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,679
probably they weren't they were never

972
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,618
really properly finished but they were

973
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:40,440
finished well enough that you know um we

974
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:42,480
we could get into the end of November

975
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,639
and sometimes even just you know first

976
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,000
couple weeks of December where I lived

977
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:50,699
uh before before the frost would that's

978
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,280
very helpful yeah and the hardest part

979
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:55,439
is actually you know not picking it

980
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,200
early kids didn't know any better and we

981
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,000
just wanted to smoke the stuff so

982
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:02,699
um you know I mean we were just going

983
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
off of the the weather reports and the

984
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:08,939
newspaper and sure you know Farmers

985
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,400
Almanac [ __ ] so maybe maybe I could

986
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,960
ask a question of both of you

987
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,420
um these first couple years that you

988
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,760
guys are both describing what were the

989
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,380
what were the the Aromas what were the

990
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,300
scents what were the terpenes you know

991
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,980
no one's no one used terpenes back then

992
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,019
but like what were the what did the

993
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,820
weeds smell like to you

994
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:28,679
you know did it just smell like we did

995
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,539
you did you get Citrus did you get any

996
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,879
kind of skunk did you get did you smell

997
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:35,338
like weed you know if you can remember

998
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,400
what Aromas were you getting off these

999
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:40,400
original Mexicans and and Colombians and

1000
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,079
these and these or even uh

1001
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,760
1979 skunk one what would that smell

1002
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:46,920
like well yeah we were gonna get there

1003
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,839
but I was just curious as like what what

1004
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,240
did oaxacan smell like

1005
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:53,519
you know like did it because you know we

1006
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:55,199
know we know these lines from like way

1007
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,358
later when they've been worked by people

1008
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,039
extensively and bred in different

1009
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,259
directions and it sounds like you guys

1010
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,380
were getting it basically from the

1011
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,420
farmer the source and this yeah from

1012
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,579
unadulterated from the farmer and the

1013
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,579
source actual like what we would call

1014
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:15,660
land race today I suppose right do you

1015
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:17,818
want to go first uh magic or

1016
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:20,639
um sure well

1017
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:23,940
the very first

1018
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,920
I'll just I have a little start up here

1019
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,500
the first two joints I bought were in

1020
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,539
1966 from the only hippie in my high

1021
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,420
school and

1022
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:34,980
um I I wasn't quite ready to smoke them

1023
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,300
so I put them in a bottle and buried

1024
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,760
them in my yard

1025
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,859
and two years later when I dug them up

1026
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,859
and thought I'll try them

1027
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:46,799
they were just mold pure mold so that

1028
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:49,679
didn't work but they had

1029
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,140
you know your really earliest weed that

1030
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,358
I remember smelling from my friend in

1031
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:55,980
well when I went to

1032
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:57,119
yeah

1033
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:02,838
um

1034
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:07,858
pine pine terpenes really stood out in

1035
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:09,719
1975 or 76 some Growers weed from Santa

1036
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:12,659
Barbara was showing up in the Verde

1037
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:15,539
Valley in Sedona Cottonwood Jerome area

1038
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:17,879
and probably coming through Phoenix and

1039
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:20,579
it smelled just like fresh pine I've

1040
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,039
never smelled weed like it again since

1041
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:25,019
then it if you close your eyes and just

1042
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,779
held it up you would think you were you

1043
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:30,239
had Pine salt in your in front of you

1044
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,260
and like a Christmas tree style or pine

1045
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,259
salt what'd you say

1046
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:39,239
um more of a Christmas tree style yeah

1047
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,760
natural Pine yeah yeah and it was it was

1048
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,699
beautiful stuff it was sensimilla it it

1049
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,760
was strong and it was very inspiring

1050
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:49,618
because when we smelled that tide wheat

1051
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,680
though Thai stick had a total different

1052
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,338
scent it was heavy and earthy

1053
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,940
um

1054
00:44:53,338 --> 00:45:00,858
I remember seeing early Thai sticks in

1055
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:03,900
1970s 71 that were

1056
00:45:00,858 --> 00:45:06,900
supposedly dipped in the Opium too or

1057
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,660
opium yeah the passive water yeah they

1058
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,700
had white on the outside

1059
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:14,399
we sat down with some black hash ones

1060
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:17,279
that was opiated supposedly but little

1061
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,519
black white specks to it and we cut out

1062
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,280
with razor blades every white Speck

1063
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:25,800
so we could have been mold huh

1064
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,560
so we could have enough to take a hit

1065
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,960
and it wasn't opium I don't know what it

1066
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,358
was it didn't get us any higher but it

1067
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,059
made the costs go up when people were

1068
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:39,119
buying it they paid more for it I've

1069
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:40,380
I've looked a lot into that situation uh

1070
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,480
especially when researching chocolate

1071
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,920
Thai because a lot of that theory behind

1072
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,780
chocolate Thai was that it was dipped in

1073
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,960
something called Pasha water or pasta

1074
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,000
water which was the the water that was

1075
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,679
left over from producing heroin it had

1076
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,599
the alkaloids the morphine alkaloids and

1077
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:56,159
stuff in it and supposedly the story was

1078
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,318
that they would dip it in that but

1079
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,879
there's not really any proof of any of

1080
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,679
this ever existing anywhere but that was

1081
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,180
the theory behind it and where we're

1082
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:04,500
kind of all stemmed from it may have

1083
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,419
happened once or twice but I don't know

1084
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,219
if it ever really got out there but I've

1085
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,079
heard about people being charged massive

1086
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:11,219
amounts of prices for these Thai sticks

1087
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,300
that were supposedly dipped in this

1088
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:15,480
water

1089
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:18,780
yeah there's been long long debates

1090
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,699
about that online but yeah you know it's

1091
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,500
uh I think it's been pretty much

1092
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:24,539
debunked mostly because the people

1093
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,780
growing the two different crops weren't

1094
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:29,099
really the same people and and a lot of

1095
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,579
them weren't producing heroin they were

1096
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:35,519
just Farmers right like not so like

1097
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:37,920
before we lose track what was the smells

1098
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,300
that you were getting off uh off your uh

1099
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,220
Hawaiian hybrids that you were

1100
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,099
successful with that second year

1101
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:46,379
right so I mean you know the the Mexican

1102
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:49,380
versus Colombian

1103
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,940
um you know pretty pretty distinctive I

1104
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,318
usually associate

1105
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:56,760
uh Cedar tastes and kind of a kind of a

1106
00:46:55,318 --> 00:47:00,179
citrus

1107
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,819
um Citrus Piney cedery taste with with

1108
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:05,759
Mexican and I grew some beautiful

1109
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:07,619
walking a couple of times that you know

1110
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,040
it flowered so much faster than the

1111
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:14,338
Colombian that I actually let it go too

1112
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:17,219
long to the point where it was it was

1113
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:19,199
actually over mature and I it had lost

1114
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:22,559
some of its potency

1115
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:25,199
um but but that was contrasted with the

1116
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,119
Colombians which were

1117
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,098
um you know usually we'd get a lot of

1118
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,960
purple

1119
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:33,599
because we they'd be coming in so late

1120
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,400
that just the temperature change would

1121
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,859
would bring out a lot of Purple colors

1122
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,318
and then you know once something turns

1123
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:43,019
purple that um

1124
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:46,079
what's that what's that uh it's not

1125
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:48,059
chlorophyll what's the others yeah the

1126
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,339
anthocyanins really seem to affect the

1127
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:53,159
taste and oh yeah you always do affects

1128
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:55,559
the taste and smell but that yeah and uh

1129
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:59,039
and personally I like it right I do too

1130
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:01,980
purple fiend yeah but um you know like

1131
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:06,119
like magic said the uh you know the pine

1132
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:08,460
was was there in in the Colombian and

1133
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,559
um there's a you know difference between

1134
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,880
the smell and The Taste when you smoke

1135
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,599
it

1136
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,579
um there's um

1137
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:20,519
yep there is there's some of it has kind

1138
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:22,260
of a chocolatey I I mean you know I

1139
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:25,739
don't want to completely Sidetrack

1140
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,680
things into a haze talk but you know my

1141
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:31,259
my belief is when I when I started

1142
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:34,078
growing oh Haze

1143
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,720
um you know a few years ago I found that

1144
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,640
the effects one day I just realized that

1145
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:42,179
the effects that I got from smoking oh

1146
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:45,900
Haze and even the tastes were exactly

1147
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:49,139
the same as what I felt that first time

1148
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:53,220
I got high riding that bicycle home

1149
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:56,338
you know yeah the Colombian and you know

1150
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:58,500
that you know it really kind of messed

1151
00:48:56,338 --> 00:49:00,659
with my head a little bit because for so

1152
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,940
long people talked about Haze as the

1153
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:07,379
mixture of you know four different kinds

1154
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:10,139
of of sativity Mexican Colombian Thai

1155
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,680
and and Indian right yeah yeah

1156
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:16,460
um and you know trying to figure out how

1157
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:20,039
this what what is obviously a you know

1158
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:23,579
Sam's the ohaze as it's been released to

1159
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:24,679
the world since since uh Sam brought it

1160
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:28,800
to

1161
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:32,039
Amsterdam yeah um you know is not

1162
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,859
everything that they that they made when

1163
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:37,318
the poster was made right and the

1164
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:39,358
pedigree was described it's that's what

1165
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:41,940
Sam brought with him that's what Sam

1166
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:45,838
preserved that's what Sam shared a

1167
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:48,300
three-way Colombian hybrid right not the

1168
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:49,858
Indian not the Thai not not the Mexican

1169
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,300
and

1170
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:54,358
um the tastes are there you know there's

1171
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,339
kind of a chocolatey taste to it

1172
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:58,920
um you know earthy you could call it

1173
00:49:56,338 --> 00:50:00,900
there's Piney

1174
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,000
um you can find some sweetness in there

1175
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,980
some Citrus there's different phenos in

1176
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,960
there but it's all coming from Colombia

1177
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,059
as far as I'm concerned and you know we

1178
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,500
can have a debate and I'll I'll let

1179
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:12,900
anybody believe what they want to

1180
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,659
believe but I I genuinely think like

1181
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,660
right now uh there is a man with a

1182
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:20,279
letter D for a name that is just smiling

1183
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:21,960
ear to ear when it when enables old

1184
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,359
partners and it's been talking to me in

1185
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,940
not so a bunch specifically about Sam's

1186
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:30,119
oh hey is being so Colombian dominant

1187
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:32,818
being so Colombian dominant and the the

1188
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:35,160
69 Hayes was it that Neville had gotten

1189
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:36,960
the first time was very much more like

1190
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:38,279
Southeast Asian dominant and that was

1191
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,519
the main difference between the haze

1192
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,200
Neville was using and why Neville cities

1193
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,119
became so popular and why a lot of the

1194
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:47,879
ohays supposedly that's one of the

1195
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,579
theories why ohays didn't come as as

1196
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,220
much as it had promised yeah it reminded

1197
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:54,720
me of something actually because uh it

1198
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:57,179
had been mentioned

1199
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,338
um earlier on on the thing is that when

1200
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:02,399
you know Thai and stuff like that was a

1201
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:06,358
little bit broader leafed right

1202
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,800
um and you know he made a point that you

1203
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:09,719
know Sam and those guys you know they

1204
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,800
kept reading towards the thin Leaf

1205
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:12,118
because they thought that was more

1206
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,859
sativa

1207
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,380
um but that was actually more Colombian

1208
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:18,539
sativa and that some of the Southeast

1209
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,220
Asian stuff and some of the ties it's

1210
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:23,338
not like they were fat weaved but they

1211
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:25,439
were broader leafed than

1212
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:28,019
um pure Colombian ones

1213
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,200
yeah I've got a picture of a tie I grew

1214
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:34,318
in 81 it was it was uh Thai stick from

1215
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,519
1980 that A friend brought home from

1216
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:37,858
college

1217
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:41,159
um older brother of one of my partners

1218
00:51:37,858 --> 00:51:45,000
brought home from college and and uh in

1219
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:46,558
Colorado and it's very thin leaf and I I

1220
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,579
know that you know people talk about

1221
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:54,839
with Ty the alligator tail leaves right

1222
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:58,019
Broad Leaf extreme serrations

1223
00:51:54,838 --> 00:52:00,358
um and it's you know it's uh it has a

1224
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:03,059
reputation for that but that was you

1225
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:04,920
know it's a it's a big country and um

1226
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,380
you know we all know from growing that

1227
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,780
man you can't even pack I'll pop a 10

1228
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,579
pack of seeds without seeing you know a

1229
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,319
couple of narrow Leafs in there with the

1230
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:15,059
wide leaves so why should we think that

1231
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:16,858
an entire country is going to produce

1232
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:20,099
nothing but the same thing of course

1233
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:22,318
micro climates everywhere yeah yeah for

1234
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:24,000
um for like Matt and myself

1235
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:25,380
um you know when I was first started

1236
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,139
smoking the only real two kinds of

1237
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,640
import I ever saw was brown Mexican and

1238
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,759
green Mexican

1239
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:35,279
I came up a little later the Thai the

1240
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,079
Colombian the you know the Panamanian

1241
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,540
all some of these different Regional

1242
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:41,280
things you know the the shift towards

1243
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:43,920
all those groups mostly importing

1244
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,079
cocaine had already happened so a lot of

1245
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,960
the diversity and imports had changed

1246
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:51,000
and there was still a bunch of Mexican

1247
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,179
um but that's kind of all it was for us

1248
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,400
yeah same experience for me even a

1249
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:58,379
decade coming in a decade I think after

1250
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,440
not so where I was starting it was the

1251
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,480
same we had Mexican was it

1252
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,579
you know talking about these Mexicans

1253
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,559
I'm thinking about mad Jag's experience

1254
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,119
with that stuff and and I I don't want

1255
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,559
to can we just stick a pin in that I

1256
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,160
want to make one more point about the

1257
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:16,740
haze and the co the Colombian um the the

1258
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,118
Colombian roots of it as we know it

1259
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:21,598
today for

1260
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:23,880
um that you know Colombia just like we

1261
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,559
were just discussing Thailand is is you

1262
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,619
know obviously going to have a diverse

1263
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,720
range of different uh different

1264
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:33,900
chemotype phenotypes whatever

1265
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:37,919
um but but you know in Colombia you had

1266
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:43,079
Reds and and Golds and and green and and

1267
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:46,019
you know black black yeah I mean so many

1268
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,480
different types and and uh they all had

1269
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:51,420
such distinctive flavors and tastes and

1270
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,460
effects um you know I was lucky you know

1271
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:57,240
when I started doing this stuff it was

1272
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:59,519
it was the end of the Gory days of those

1273
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:03,000
Elite

1274
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:07,318
um those Elite types of of weed I got to

1275
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:10,858
smoke the Panama Colombian red

1276
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:15,300
um I I got to smoke real Santa Mara gold

1277
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:18,058
and um you know they all have things in

1278
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,339
common but but they were some unique

1279
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:23,160
characteristics about them that just you

1280
00:54:20,338 --> 00:54:26,219
know Vive La difference you know just uh

1281
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:28,618
yeah big big big fan of uh are The

1282
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:31,318
Connoisseur and High Times magazine and

1283
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:34,140
he uh he inspired me to become a

1284
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:36,480
connoisseur of life and and appreciate

1285
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:39,058
all the differences between things and

1286
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,818
Savor them and I want to point this out

1287
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:43,740
just because I I just even a recent

1288
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:46,318
episode I I made a statement that I

1289
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,818
thought R was Robert Clark because

1290
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:49,980
that's kind of what people have been

1291
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:52,500
saying forever or it's assumed but I

1292
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:55,199
think that might be wrong Maybe

1293
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,760
totally wrong totally wrong so yeah

1294
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,318
that's that's an important note to make

1295
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,940
because I have always Associated

1296
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:01,858
everything Robert Clark's ever written

1297
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,240
with are The Connoisseur and I love

1298
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:04,679
Arthur connoisseur and I love Robert

1299
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:06,838
Clark too but I've always Associated

1300
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:07,858
them as the same person and and they're

1301
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:11,818
not

1302
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:12,838
no I asked Rob himself because yeah long

1303
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:13,619
ago

1304
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:16,440
um

1305
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:19,980
I wondered the same question and he said

1306
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,838
no and I I've actually heard r's real

1307
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,858
name and I can't remember it right now

1308
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:28,739
but someone I know from Manhattan knows

1309
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:30,539
him and and said oh no that's a

1310
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:31,739
different guy I wonder if he's still

1311
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:34,558
with us

1312
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:36,299
I don't know ah man you'd be a great one

1313
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,740
to interview one thing I'm curious about

1314
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,359
and I don't wanna there's so many

1315
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:41,939
threads that happen in these kind of

1316
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:43,500
convos you could lose it at but

1317
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,720
um when you were describing how

1318
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,338
difficult it was to get to your Canyon

1319
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,858
grows

1320
00:55:47,338 --> 00:55:51,358
um having done some gorilla myself and

1321
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:53,279
and hidden

1322
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,199
um obviously like growing it is one

1323
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,460
thing but then harvesting it and drying

1324
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,500
it and getting it out of there is

1325
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:01,139
another thing could you talk for a

1326
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,880
minute about what that was like if

1327
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:05,039
you're going down some Goat Trail

1328
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,980
through the rocks and all of a sudden

1329
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:09,900
you have several hundred pounds that

1330
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,300
would be dry you know that I mean more

1331
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,460
like a thousand pounds when it's wet you

1332
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:17,039
know did you try to dry it there in the

1333
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,480
bushes did you hike it all out one by

1334
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,279
one

1335
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,240
um how much effort went into that

1336
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:26,040
because I that's a real struggle

1337
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:29,219
we

1338
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:33,719
once we started growing in our own

1339
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:35,818
Canyon in Magic Canyon we did everything

1340
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:37,980
um except for that first year where you

1341
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:39,960
had the photo of my friend down next to

1342
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,599
the water but the subsequent two years

1343
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:46,260
with my partner from the UK

1344
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,940
and we had a Swiss helper too who I'm

1345
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:51,480
still good friends with I saw him three

1346
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:54,240
years ago in Zurich he we did everything

1347
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,940
down there we manicured it we dried it

1348
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:59,459
manicured it boxed it we we bought

1349
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:02,579
knocked down boxes from A supplier in

1350
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:04,519
Phoenix that were roughly I'd say about

1351
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:07,859
well

1352
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:08,818
for 12 inches by eight inches by six

1353
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:11,699
inches

1354
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:14,219
and that held a pound

1355
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:17,639
so that's perfect what we did we we

1356
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:20,338
brought Kelty pack frames that were just

1357
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:23,940
bare frames without the uh Associated

1358
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:26,639
baggage on them and bungee cords and we

1359
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,800
could stack five of these boxes on one

1360
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:32,219
Kelty so you could carry out five pounds

1361
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:35,460
oh wow every every bit was hiked out

1362
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:38,759
that way up this 1600 foot wash of

1363
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,858
Boulders and strewn and we had pruned a

1364
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,440
few branches here and there where you

1365
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:45,078
just had to have clearance to get under

1366
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,358
a pine tree or something

1367
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:52,140
and we were very fortunate because

1368
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:53,940
are one of the people in my life who's

1369
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:56,279
still around he was one of the two

1370
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:59,880
principles of peyote that I've written

1371
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,500
about he also is a huge weed dealer and

1372
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,019
he would meet us at the edge of our

1373
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:07,199
Canyon after sunset

1374
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:09,659
and we would just hike up Hannah however

1375
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:12,480
many boxes we brought up and he'd hand

1376
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:14,338
us a paper bag full of cash and we

1377
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,059
didn't have to even drive to Phoenix or

1378
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:20,639
take the risk of trying to take it back

1379
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:22,380
home because that was actually the

1380
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,838
thought of working that hard for a year

1381
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:28,500
and then losing it all because you got a

1382
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:30,299
traffic stop that was really influenced

1383
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,579
us so

1384
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,579
we got a hundred dollars an ounce

1385
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:38,700
sixteen hundred a pound and

1386
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:41,099
that was the standard price and yeah he

1387
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:44,159
sold it all by grams

1388
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:46,318
smart man he sold he sold it for ten

1389
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,139
dollars a gram to college students at

1390
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:52,318
ASU he lived two blocks away from from

1391
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:55,558
ASU in Tennessee he just would buy

1392
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:58,500
everything we had and just slowly sell

1393
00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:01,140
it over a year or two and triple his

1394
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:03,119
money so you had a you had a you had a

1395
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:04,259
uh you had one or two friends that were

1396
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,260
helping you

1397
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:09,119
right so when it comes to hiking it out

1398
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:11,579
if you could bring about five pounds at

1399
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:15,059
a time that means each trip you're

1400
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:19,079
probably at a maximum of 10 or 15 pounds

1401
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:21,240
yep um yeah so at Harvard we brought in

1402
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,980
six more people at Harvest Time okay

1403
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:24,659
that makes more sense yeah I was gonna

1404
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:27,480
say I was like man you were really fit

1405
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:30,058
uh yeah your your legs your hiking

1406
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:33,838
ability was intense because it's a lot

1407
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:35,640
of back and forth yeah well that part I

1408
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:38,818
mean I've

1409
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:41,940
I've hiked down gasoline you know five

1410
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:45,298
gallons of gas is like 35 pounds and

1411
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:47,460
yeah garbage bags and it would still

1412
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:48,900
stink it was amazing because shaking it

1413
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,480
and moving down

1414
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:54,298
it was so difficult to keep it not from

1415
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,719
saturating everything but at Harvest

1416
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:59,460
Time boyfriends and girlfriends of ours

1417
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:02,159
and others

1418
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:03,260
um at most we had eight people down

1419
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,098
there

1420
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,599
manicuring

1421
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:09,720
um we

1422
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:12,660
we set up a 10 by 10 foot Coleman

1423
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:15,058
classic tents that were spray painted

1424
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:17,039
so they were a light brown color but we

1425
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:19,500
sprayed them with a little darkness and

1426
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:23,099
green and they Blended in very nicely

1427
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:25,798
and we limbed the plants

1428
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:27,720
we we cut

1429
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:29,818
we cut a whole plant if we could if it

1430
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:32,578
wasn't too big we'd hang it

1431
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:36,239
for a day or two and then we'd cut the

1432
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:38,818
branches off lemon and stacked them like

1433
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:41,039
like that all the way up inside these

1434
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:43,980
tents so in case it did rain we weren't

1435
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,858
going to get caught in you know with our

1436
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,740
yeah you know

1437
01:00:45,858 --> 01:00:52,739
did you do a lot of sun drying

1438
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:56,039
no it was all and I know

1439
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:58,139
we hung Roots between trees and just

1440
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:01,139
hung them in there and it was still in

1441
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:03,598
the 90s or 80s in the day at night it

1442
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:06,900
would drop up where we were growing we

1443
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,579
were growing at about 4 500 feet so it

1444
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,920
at night it would cool down but in the

1445
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:14,460
day this you know it was really nice

1446
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,920
plus we were growing in our main Garden

1447
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,679
was in an east west

1448
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,619
situation so that the sun when it came

1449
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:25,919
up it hit very early and it went almost

1450
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:29,460
to the end of of the night because it

1451
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,900
did drop below the uh Canyon Edge at

1452
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,940
each end but

1453
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,358
one of our Gardens was in the north

1454
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:38,460
south section it only got seven hours or

1455
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:41,338
eight hours of direct sunlight at Max

1456
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:43,940
yeah and still the plants grew perfectly

1457
01:01:41,338 --> 01:01:47,039
and beautifully didn't make a difference

1458
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:51,358
but the east west

1459
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:54,798
Gardens you know they got 10 11 hours of

1460
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:58,318
direct sunlight were awesome yeah they

1461
01:01:54,798 --> 01:02:01,318
grew much bigger plants much taller

1462
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,480
for what uh when did when did the

1463
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:05,940
Mexicans naturally finish like when was

1464
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,679
your Harvest Time when when were they

1465
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,179
ripe those first few years for you

1466
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:13,618
October

1467
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:16,500
October yeah the Colombian you passed a

1468
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:18,480
photo by their earlier

1469
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,679
that was the

1470
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,900
it was

1471
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:26,639
um it was snowing on the rim above us on

1472
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:30,139
Thanksgiving

1473
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,460
and that's our ten one of them yeah

1474
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:34,500
there it is

1475
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,838
right in there

1476
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,880
well hidden that was a that was the

1477
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:40,139
north south Garden we called the Anasazi

1478
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,740
there's the Hall of the Mountain King

1479
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:46,920
you cannot you know that kept hikers out

1480
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:49,199
yeah anyway the Colombian the Colombian

1481
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,059
we didn't know about these things about

1482
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:54,899
finishing and how long they would take

1483
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:57,180
and it was crazy because it was they

1484
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:59,160
were the size of my little fingertip you

1485
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:02,219
know the buds and yeah it was

1486
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,618
Thanksgiving and snowing above us

1487
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:07,699
so we didn't grow any more Colombian

1488
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:07,700
after that first year

1489
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:16,139
I think was it by R anyway there's this

1490
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:18,838
famous there's this famous

1491
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:20,759
um list of seeds that's been attributed

1492
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:22,798
to Sam or it's been attributed to others

1493
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,599
or whatever and it had a bunch of you

1494
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:25,739
know hazes and skunks and different

1495
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:27,240
things like that but what was

1496
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:30,539
interesting about it

1497
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:31,379
is it was organized by month that it

1498
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:33,298
finished

1499
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,280
and there was only three or four things

1500
01:03:33,298 --> 01:03:36,960
that finished in October there was

1501
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,180
probably 10 things that finished in

1502
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,699
November and then there was like 25

1503
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:45,000
things that were December or January

1504
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:48,000
which is like a polar opposite of today

1505
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,500
um yeah well Rob was growing in Ben

1506
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,960
Lomond

1507
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:55,019
um just above Santa Cruz in the Redwoods

1508
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,260
there and he you know the the

1509
01:03:55,019 --> 01:04:01,579
temperatures were very Mediterraneans in

1510
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,579
a sense you know yeah

1511
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:07,039
um back I wanted to jump forward to a

1512
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:10,440
question when you were talking about

1513
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,058
Mendocino and up north did you ever do

1514
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,059
you know where Redway is

1515
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:15,059
yes

1516
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:24,179
because I met my Colombian friend in in

1517
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:27,539
future partner in many escapades at the

1518
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:31,379
country Tavern there in 1972.

1519
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:32,818
oh wow a guy a guy from Scottsdale owned

1520
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:36,059
the country Tavern

1521
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:37,980
and he also had his own chemist and he

1522
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:39,680
produced millions and millions of hits

1523
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:43,199
of acid

1524
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:44,940
that's amazing when we went into that

1525
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:47,879
Tavern the first time

1526
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:51,059
half the people were tripping and it was

1527
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,700
just wow it was like strange but my

1528
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:55,380
Colombian friend who I just met there he

1529
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:57,659
took me on a hike down towards Shelter

1530
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:00,000
Cove Shelter Cove was was just five

1531
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:02,338
houses then that were abandoned because

1532
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,699
it was a someone tried to do a

1533
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:07,920
subdivision there and it didn't work so

1534
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:09,598
as we hiked down we went off into the

1535
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,420
woods because he knew about a few plants

1536
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:15,420
and I saw my first plants over there

1537
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:17,519
that were growing they were individual

1538
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:19,858
holes in between the Redwoods like where

1539
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:21,838
there was a spot of sun shooting down in

1540
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:24,358
and it was just this beautiful black

1541
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:26,578
rich soil and their plants were you know

1542
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:28,440
probably six or seven feet tall so I was

1543
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:30,440
like wow that's cool

1544
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,960
but yeah that's my part of the country

1545
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,179
I've I moved to Mendocino County in 1998

1546
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,338
and I've lived there since so Southern

1547
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:40,558
humble Humboldt in general Mendocino

1548
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:42,719
Lake all those areas that's kind of like

1549
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:46,140
my stomping grounds

1550
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:47,699
um and uh yeah and you know like like

1551
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:49,139
you were saying with LSD or whatever

1552
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:52,078
else

1553
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:55,199
um you know there was back then it was

1554
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,700
remote uh it was mountainous you could

1555
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,219
get you know there wasn't very many

1556
01:05:56,699 --> 01:06:01,919
people uh your worries up there were

1557
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:04,019
hunters and loggers

1558
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,639
um right but lots of people went up

1559
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:07,380
there to kind of get away from things

1560
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:09,719
some people grew weeds some people did

1561
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,880
other things but it was that isolation

1562
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:13,259
and that and that being kind of out in

1563
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,680
the middle of nowhere

1564
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:18,240
Ville that was kind of no idea

1565
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:21,058
I have no idea how this guy from

1566
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:23,519
Scottsdale found Redway but that he

1567
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:26,519
bought the cut the tavern there and he

1568
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:29,699
was living nearby and his chemist was

1569
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:33,119
somewhere nearby out in the woods and

1570
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:35,639
um yeah if it was a interesting place

1571
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,318
and that's where my Colombian friend was

1572
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,699
Gerardo

1573
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:40,858
so

1574
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:45,179
he was on a student visa but he

1575
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:46,440
overstayed an extra eight years

1576
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:49,460
so

1577
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,780
um yeah he he spoke he learned English

1578
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:54,599
simultaneously with Spanish in Colombia

1579
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:57,780
and Cali since he was five years old so

1580
01:06:54,599 --> 01:07:00,480
he spoke such perfect English that

1581
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,859
later in life when we were

1582
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,139
our big

1583
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:06,659
big bust happen

1584
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:08,900
um he was interviewed by FBI agents he

1585
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:12,358
corrected their spelling twice

1586
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:14,760
oh wow because they didn't know how to

1587
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:17,460
spell the words that they were using so

1588
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,200
it was pretty funny yeah and you know

1589
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,659
another thought I had you met you

1590
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:24,179
mentioned uh you know Howard marks's

1591
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:26,038
book Mr Nice and how your friend kind of

1592
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:27,779
blew him out of the water

1593
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:30,480
um I remember a long time ago when I

1594
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:32,640
read his autobiography that he said that

1595
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,380
basically his autobiography was full of

1596
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,420
people that had been busted

1597
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,880
and that some of the coolest and biggest

1598
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:40,619
people that he interacted with had never

1599
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,240
got in trouble so therefore you weren't

1600
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:45,720
going to hear anything about them in his

1601
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,338
book because they had skated through and

1602
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:50,219
nobody knew about them and he wasn't

1603
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:51,838
about to give any tips or ideas so he

1604
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:53,759
said his book was essentially a

1605
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:54,838
collection of people that had gotten in

1606
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,420
trouble

1607
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:59,519
and that there was many who didn't and

1608
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:04,019
they were invisible

1609
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:06,960
well I I can dig it my friend who who

1610
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:10,380
broke his hip and was my our pilot

1611
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,679
friend he um never got busted and he

1612
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:15,720
gave my UK partner the go-ahead that he

1613
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:19,979
would be willing to let him write a book

1614
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:22,139
about him and interview him so

1615
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:23,159
he's excited about that but I said to

1616
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,660
him

1617
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:26,159
um you're gonna have to follow this guy

1618
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:27,899
because he's all over the world still

1619
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,659
you know now he's in the hospital in

1620
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:33,838
Anchorage so you could probably get some

1621
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:37,219
weeks of talk with him but you know he

1622
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:40,439
goes he still goes to Hong Kong and

1623
01:08:37,219 --> 01:08:43,198
Portugal and I mean the guy is

1624
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:46,079
um he's 75 and

1625
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:49,500
he got his pilot's license when he was

1626
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:52,380
15 before he could drive a car and we

1627
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:55,198
figured it out once he stopped keeping a

1628
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:57,900
log book at 10 000 hours and he said

1629
01:08:55,198 --> 01:09:00,899
that most TWA Pilots never hit 10 000

1630
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:02,879
hours yeah but he literally lives in his

1631
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:06,179
his plane and then when he went to

1632
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,039
Alaska and bought a a gold mine the only

1633
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:11,399
way to get to it was to fly in and out

1634
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:13,859
so and as you know in Alaska everyone

1635
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:16,139
uses planes like cars you know if they

1636
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:19,980
live way out in the woods

1637
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:23,400
so he he owned the airport once in a

1638
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:25,738
town that I lived in and he's just a

1639
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:28,679
legend but you're right no one really

1640
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:30,419
knew about him just like Mr nice's

1641
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:31,920
Howard Mark's friends

1642
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:34,859
um because

1643
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:38,039
he got into Afghanistan in the late 60s

1644
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:40,640
he was importing lapis the deep blue

1645
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:44,100
stone that yeah highly valued in Europe

1646
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:46,739
and that led to hashish

1647
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:49,739
and he was just sending home a few

1648
01:09:46,738 --> 01:09:51,778
pounds rolled up in Afghani rugs he

1649
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:52,979
would just ship them and they would get

1650
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:55,739
through back then they weren't even

1651
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:58,979
using dogs really to check stuff in the

1652
01:09:55,738 --> 01:10:02,218
late 60s or 1970

1653
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:05,159
then his friends slowly

1654
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:07,020
you know move to Freighters and they

1655
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,819
were sending Freighters but when the

1656
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:11,640
Soviets took over he couldn't go to

1657
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:15,000
Afghanistan any longer so he moved over

1658
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,880
to Peshawar in Pakistan into Star Wars

1659
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,979
now is known as the terrorist capital I

1660
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,020
mean that's where all that for sure oh

1661
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:27,139
the terrorists hang up that [ __ ] before

1662
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:29,280
but he would um he was active over there

1663
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,920
gosh I don't know

1664
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:35,039
I like I said last time I met him in 85

1665
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:38,579
in in um

1666
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:40,019
he had a houseboat in Sausalito and I

1667
01:10:38,579 --> 01:10:43,260
met him there and

1668
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:45,900
he was visibly shaking because he was so

1669
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,640
excited about the 60-ton barge that they

1670
01:10:45,899 --> 01:10:50,698
were going to pull across the the

1671
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:54,980
universe which they did more than that

1672
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:57,479
was awesome that is so awesome wow yep

1673
01:10:54,979 --> 01:11:00,658
and they would go to Canada

1674
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:02,519
Canada had yeah he said they had only

1675
01:11:00,658 --> 01:11:05,899
like a thousand not even a thousand a

1676
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:10,260
few hundred agents in involved in drugs

1677
01:11:05,899 --> 01:11:13,619
so all those West Coast places above

1678
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:17,579
Juno in Alaska and that were perfect I

1679
01:11:13,619 --> 01:11:19,679
mean in Canada along the coastline yeah

1680
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:22,079
[Music]

1681
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,239
so Canada has much more of a hashish

1682
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:26,519
culture than America did because of that

1683
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:28,500
importing and you know I think not only

1684
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,080
that but it was like the penalties if

1685
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:34,579
you got caught in Canada were far less

1686
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:37,800
than the American ones right right now

1687
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:40,859
and once it reached there it would get

1688
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,119
him exported over to the U.S

1689
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:43,619
um yeah and

1690
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:45,779
this guy

1691
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:48,059
he he had a

1692
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:52,139
a passport he paid ten thousand dollars

1693
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:54,000
for from the UK in like 1969 or

1694
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:57,719
something and it was a real passport

1695
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,939
that um he was able to have it fixed

1696
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:02,100
with his name on it that's awesome and

1697
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:04,019
his photo and he would he would walk

1698
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,000
across the border to Canada

1699
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:08,520
and then fly from Canada around the

1700
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,619
world as a British citizen

1701
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,840
when he was going to Afghanistan and

1702
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:15,420
Pakistan he wasn't an American he was

1703
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,920
British so and then he'd fly back to

1704
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,500
Canada and walk across the border into

1705
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:22,500
Washington and be and then go back to

1706
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:25,800
his normal life over here man after my

1707
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:27,899
own heart yeah he also had one of the

1708
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,400
first phone scramblers I've ever seen he

1709
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:32,158
bought it from a company in Amsterdam

1710
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:34,500
and you held it up to the phone and the

1711
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:35,939
little rubber cups went over each end

1712
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,640
and then you talked to the back of it

1713
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:43,019
and yeah it was used and stuff like that

1714
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:44,820
you know by 1970 1971 very security

1715
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:46,739
conscience fella

1716
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:51,420
very smart

1717
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:53,939
yep wow that's fascinating so so

1718
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:55,440
I was gonna say I we we've we've kind of

1719
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:57,719
wandered off the Mad Jag part but

1720
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:59,099
there's one part that like totally

1721
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:03,300
totally enthralled me with the whole

1722
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:05,400
story and it was about not just about

1723
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:07,320
the wizard robes or any of that because

1724
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:08,698
I find that so amazing like the pictures

1725
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:10,079
of you guys with wearing the wizard

1726
01:13:08,698 --> 01:13:12,178
robes and being very you know serious

1727
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,920
about all this but how well you treated

1728
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:15,899
the land and how you respected the land

1729
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,920
and the culture that came before and in

1730
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:20,279
a lot of your writings you talk about

1731
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:22,140
even finding ancient like the ancient

1732
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:24,420
petroglyphs but also some items and

1733
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,739
stuff that you guys would not take you'd

1734
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,260
leave it there because that's where it

1735
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:30,238
was and and all and leaving nothing not

1736
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:31,199
even Footprints behind so I was

1737
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:32,698
wondering if you could talk a little bit

1738
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,238
about the spiritual aspect of magic

1739
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:35,238
Canyon

1740
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:42,420
um well when we first started exploring

1741
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:46,139
it I started from the bottom up where it

1742
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:49,319
flowed into another Canyon which flowed

1743
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:52,619
into another Canyon and

1744
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:54,658
that's where I first met a mountain lion

1745
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:57,599
I'm pretty sure it was it wasn't a

1746
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:59,579
Jaguar but we came up with the term you

1747
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,739
know mad Jag that I had come upon

1748
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:04,260
because it was screeching at me in the

1749
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:07,079
dark when I was trying to go to sleep oh

1750
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:09,539
my God oh my God when we got further up

1751
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:11,399
the canyon and found these spots we

1752
01:14:09,539 --> 01:14:14,219
started finding Boulders just covered

1753
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:17,759
with pictograph I mean petroglyphs and

1754
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:19,739
in 15 minutes that rock that you had a

1755
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,679
photo of let's see I'm gonna try to find

1756
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:25,139
this yeah we hadn't we had a projectile

1757
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:27,300
point in all these pieces of pottery and

1758
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:31,679
we just left them there like a little

1759
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:34,980
little Shrine or altar yeah we also

1760
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:36,719
found a cave across from our garden the

1761
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:38,039
first year where I was working with that

1762
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:42,300
tall guy

1763
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:45,238
um and in this cave was a uh those are

1764
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,980
Colombians there this is the Colombian

1765
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:49,139
right here yeah those are all the ones

1766
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:52,379
that's as big as they got this is close

1767
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:55,500
to Thanksgiving this photo that's wild

1768
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:58,859
they they grew huge but they they just

1769
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,819
they needed to get into December in the

1770
01:14:58,859 --> 01:15:03,000
tropical

1771
01:14:59,819 --> 01:15:06,420
let's see where's the petrol place here

1772
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,539
there we go there's some beautiful

1773
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:11,399
and we we did these costumes and things

1774
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:13,319
thinking that someday we would do a

1775
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:15,779
movie you know and that's why we were

1776
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:18,119
doing this and here's the I still have

1777
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:20,939
this little Arrowhead here but we left

1778
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:22,800
all the pottery behind and

1779
01:15:20,939 --> 01:15:26,819
and

1780
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:29,100
we've found a cave across from near our

1781
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:33,359
first Garden that had an arrow shaft in

1782
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:34,579
it it had a a single Yucca fiber

1783
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:37,619
um

1784
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:40,198
moccasin that the ancient people you

1785
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:43,260
know the made out of Yucca fiber and

1786
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:45,599
they were like about half inch thick and

1787
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:48,539
they had been chewed up a lot by a rat

1788
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,860
but you know they were obviously in this

1789
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:51,960
this cave

1790
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:52,859
um so we just left them there as a

1791
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,439
little

1792
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:57,319
Museum we we put them all on a rock

1793
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:01,019
together

1794
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:03,719
I'd love to go back to it

1795
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:07,920
but we um

1796
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:11,219
the one thing we didn't do which I

1797
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:14,699
regret but it could still happen was

1798
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:17,279
take all of our old um hoses out of the

1799
01:16:14,698 --> 01:16:20,698
canyon and the pump they're still there

1800
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:23,219
yeah oh my God it's still there oh yeah

1801
01:16:20,698 --> 01:16:25,738
they're tucked under the tree we went

1802
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:28,619
back in the 90s and the bear had pulled

1803
01:16:25,738 --> 01:16:30,899
a bunch of them out so we buried them

1804
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:33,059
and pushed them back under

1805
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:35,279
um and the pump got hiked out ultimately

1806
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:38,760
by someone who wanted to use it and

1807
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:41,099
that's funny this guy was a young

1808
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,860
stallion man he's just strapped that

1809
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:46,860
sucker on a single

1810
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:48,899
pack frame and hiked it out himself and

1811
01:16:46,859 --> 01:16:51,658
we had taken it in two of us on a pole

1812
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:55,259
you know between us but he just hiked it

1813
01:16:51,658 --> 01:16:57,599
out yeah so he said if you can get it

1814
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:59,340
out you can have it what year did that

1815
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,360
happen and he knew you guys before and

1816
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,800
you guys told him about the pump

1817
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:04,259
existing

1818
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:09,300
he was this tall guy's mother-in-law

1819
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:11,400
okay that makes sense yeah so um he he

1820
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:14,340
went in and

1821
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:18,479
he worked he came down I think at

1822
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:21,480
Harvest Time and helped us a bit

1823
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:23,279
he since left the planet though he was

1824
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:24,539
much younger than all of us but he he

1825
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:29,219
lived a

1826
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:33,539
Rough and Tumble life you know and yeah

1827
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:34,380
yep he uh didn't make it but it's

1828
01:17:33,539 --> 01:17:37,260
it's

1829
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:39,659
um the spiritual aspect

1830
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:42,480
I've slept right where he's sitting here

1831
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:44,579
a few times next to the creek and

1832
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:46,979
listened to it flowing by at night it

1833
01:17:44,579 --> 01:17:48,658
was the most fabulous thing in the in

1834
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:52,500
talking about Dark Skies

1835
01:17:48,658 --> 01:17:56,099
in 19 you know late 70s the dark skies

1836
01:17:52,500 --> 01:18:00,619
in northern Arizona were extensive

1837
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:00,620
um yeah Flagstaff was the nearest place

1838
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:06,960
um I spent 400 Days out of my life in

1839
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:10,800
the bottom of this Canyon and

1840
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:14,100
over a year of my life and it's it's

1841
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:17,340
just you know it became like my second

1842
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:19,320
home in a way I can imagine five years

1843
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:20,460
ago we grew for five years in this

1844
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:22,500
Canyon

1845
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:25,920
and

1846
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:27,479
um since then it's been just quiet I we

1847
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,600
every once in a while I'll go back and

1848
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:31,259
go out on the rim and look down in and

1849
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,719
um

1850
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:36,300
more people are driving in four-wheel

1851
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:38,819
drives and razors and little four by

1852
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,619
side by side Vehicles you know they're

1853
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:42,119
going out on all these Jeep trails and

1854
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:44,219
that but they don't know what's down

1855
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:46,859
below because they're not going to get

1856
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:48,119
out and hike down 1600 feet

1857
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:51,179
um

1858
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:53,099
just on a hunch and get down there and

1859
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:55,158
they wouldn't find these alluvial

1860
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:59,179
plateaus they're just too

1861
01:18:55,158 --> 01:19:03,179
buried you know that's so wild

1862
01:18:59,179 --> 01:19:05,819
yeah 90 90 feet above the creek

1863
01:19:03,179 --> 01:19:10,800
um you wouldn't there's no trail that

1864
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:13,259
would even remotely bump into it so yeah

1865
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,380
yeah it was a special place still is um

1866
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:19,199
I went back there four years ago looking

1867
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:22,800
for this trail that a Rancher had made

1868
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:25,619
years ago that came down not far from

1869
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,260
this original garden and I couldn't find

1870
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:30,238
the trailhead again it had grown over so

1871
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:31,679
much in 10 years that when I was there

1872
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,079
to last

1873
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,719
hunted all over man for hours and hours

1874
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:39,000
and I know where it goes down but I just

1875
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:41,640
couldn't find the trailhead so

1876
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,219
I'm going to go back it's strange it was

1877
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:46,199
it's in a forest fire area that has

1878
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:49,619
still not been reopened

1879
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:51,899
and after uh a fire that was over a year

1880
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:53,219
and a half ago and I'm gonna go talk to

1881
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:56,819
the Forester because I want to find out

1882
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:58,859
why and I have a feeling why is that

1883
01:19:56,819 --> 01:20:01,500
it's not about landslides or people

1884
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:04,799
getting hurt it's exposed so many

1885
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:07,679
architecture archaeological spots from

1886
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,480
the trees burning and there's all this

1887
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,760
that they're I think they're afraid of

1888
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:15,899
people going out there and plundering

1889
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,500
yeah spots that's very human

1890
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:18,500
yeah

1891
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,760
that was more used in where the guys

1892
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:27,360
from Jerome were using it

1893
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:29,100
um I've seen skulls

1894
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:32,579
just laying on the surface where people

1895
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:35,400
had dug to burial sites you know ancient

1896
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:39,179
burial sites It's just sad but uh wild

1897
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:42,000
it goes on yeah Raiders of the Lost Art

1898
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:44,100
they did an article in Tempe in the

1899
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,158
early 80s about guys who would go out

1900
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:50,820
and just look for burial sites and dig

1901
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:53,279
them up oh wow yes plunder one of them I

1902
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:54,599
knew and he got busted got five years in

1903
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:58,139
prison

1904
01:20:54,600 --> 01:21:00,659
um because of you know ancient still

1905
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:02,159
driving that's what happens I mean

1906
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:04,139
ancient grave robbing is something

1907
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,238
that's been going on for a long long

1908
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:09,000
time and they get they get sold on the

1909
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:10,919
private Market to collectors and you

1910
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,658
know the origin of you know all that

1911
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,640
it's it's definitely a I mean it's a

1912
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:16,319
shame that it happens but it it seems

1913
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:18,780
like it goes on anywhere there's ancient

1914
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:20,340
Humanity that existed

1915
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:24,840
oh yeah

1916
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:26,819
Egypt yeah Egypt Egypt would be the one

1917
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,340
of the primary sources sure

1918
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:32,279
yeah yeah

1919
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:34,860
so I don't know I don't I mean we could

1920
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:37,079
this conversation could likely go in a

1921
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:37,979
million different directions yeah I

1922
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:40,380
think they're feeling this is going to

1923
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:42,299
be like a nine-parter it could be it

1924
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:44,400
would probably be more than just this

1925
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,500
one part because we can't touch on

1926
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:49,679
everything but one of the things I do

1927
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:51,960
want to touch on is that one one thing

1928
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,940
that's like really interesting demands

1929
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:56,460
ourselves is that

1930
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:58,738
um you know some of these you know we

1931
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,239
got a little off topic on Haze and you

1932
01:21:58,738 --> 01:22:01,979
know and but some of this stuff with

1933
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,279
Haze and skunk one and some of these

1934
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:08,459
American strains a lot of us younger

1935
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:10,738
folk our first like legitimate history

1936
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:12,300
on them that we know of comes from when

1937
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:14,939
they made their way over to Holland

1938
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,560
right and that's when they kind of

1939
01:22:14,939 --> 01:22:18,658
became famous and started getting bread

1940
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,640
with and started getting sold where

1941
01:22:18,658 --> 01:22:22,979
people could hear about them and then

1942
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,860
you have people like Rob and and Sam and

1943
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:28,379
stuff like that who tell their story but

1944
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:31,198
it's very you know with historians or

1945
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,359
whatever it's always cool to get a

1946
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:35,460
different perspective from someone you

1947
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:38,579
know an alternate Source from the same

1948
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:41,520
era right and you were talking before

1949
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:43,979
about how for a minute there or for a

1950
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,900
year or two you were Sam and Rob's

1951
01:22:43,979 --> 01:22:47,939
biggest customer

1952
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:49,559
right yep in the sense that you bought

1953
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:50,939
you bought something like if I remember

1954
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:54,360
correctly off the top of my head

1955
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:58,139
something like 3 000 skunk one seeds

1956
01:22:54,359 --> 01:23:00,738
fifty five hundred dollars was that 1978

1957
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:03,900
or 1979 something like that you said

1958
01:23:00,738 --> 01:23:05,579
79.80 and and on the back of this if you

1959
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:08,939
look at it up close it says that these

1960
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:13,019
were bred for the 1980 in 1980 for the

1961
01:23:08,939 --> 01:23:15,960
1981 season do you still have it

1962
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,980
yeah so you still have that

1963
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,859
yeah

1964
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:22,439

1967
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:29,519
cartel in Mexico at a certain point in

1968
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,619
1980

1969
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,780

1970
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:37,140
82 to 84.

1971
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:38,579
um we would get we moved our first load

1972
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,920
so quickly that they sent us another

1973
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:43,279
load that was wasn't meant for us it had

1974
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,359
labels in it from some one in California

1975
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,800
and I've got two or three of these

1976
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:50,819
labels I know you'd like to have them

1977
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:55,320
and I'd be glad this time I um Sam

1978
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:58,198
wanted them too Sam collects yeah yes

1979
01:23:55,319 --> 01:24:02,880
this one this one was

1980
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:05,158
it was a a Santa Claus in a uh in a uh

1981
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,560
wagon pulled by horses and it was in a

1982
01:24:05,158 --> 01:24:09,899
black it's a black and white label and

1983
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:12,179
then we got another one a different time

1984
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:13,920
there was someone else's load but

1985
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:16,859
because we were moving them faster they

1986
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:19,079
just sent it to us and it was a raccoon

1987
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:21,839
on the label and it was from Northern

1988
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:25,340
California and um yeah it was it was

1989
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,340
funny but these

1990
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:28,619
yeah

1991
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,600
these are precious

1992
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:32,399
um little mementos

1993
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:36,120
and

1994
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:38,339
I I went to Amsterdam in 1969 right out

1995
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:40,500
of high school I went on seven weeks to

1996
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:42,960
Europe with a friend and that's the

1997
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:46,560
first place I tried to get high I was at

1998
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,179
the club Paradisio and I couldn't I

1999
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,360
didn't smoke cigarettes so I took a big

2000
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:53,520
hit of of something and I coughed my

2001
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:56,039
lungs I couldn't even get it in deep

2002
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:59,040
enough to get it but to give you an idea

2003
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:02,119
this guy was selling a pound of of

2004
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:05,760
Turkish weed for fifteen dollars

2005
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:09,719
it was in a shoe box a shoebox full was

2006
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:12,600
15 bucks and I have no idea

2007
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:15,779
huh do you think it was like

2008
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:18,239
yeah it was probably you know like

2009
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:20,460
bagweed from Turkey yeah that's dark

2010
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:22,500
brown it didn't look good

2011
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:25,020
um but I bought my first chunk of hash

2012
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:27,719
and I actually smuggled it back in 1969

2013
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:28,380
I was nervous as heck yeah okay

2014
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,640
um

2015
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:33,659
I didn't

2016
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:36,239
actually get high until later in 69 when

2017
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:37,920
I went to college that was the the first

2018
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:41,939
time and I don't know if I had that hash

2019
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,800
still then or not but Denver in 1969 had

2020
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:47,819
everything you know

2021
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:48,480
Panama Red Colombian Mexican

2022
01:25:47,819 --> 01:25:50,880
um

2023
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:53,339
every sort of acid you could possibly

2024
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,739
want was being sold at On The Hill in

2025
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:58,500
Boulder so yeah all you have to do is

2026
01:25:55,738 --> 01:26:01,319
drive over to Boulder and hang out

2027
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:03,600
and was it called back then

2028
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:06,179
it was just called the hill

2029
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,760
it's called the hill and Boulder yeah it

2030
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:11,520
was in the next is near the university

2031
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:15,060
but it was this stretch

2032
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:18,000
and it still really works yeah there's a

2033
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:19,860
bookstore at the top where

2034
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
um I actually saw Ellen Ginsberg reading

2035
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:24,979
the book

2036
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:28,500
um it was called brilliant works and

2037
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:30,359
tulagi on the hill is still there it's a

2038
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:32,819
place where they have live music it's a

2039
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:35,158
bar with live music I saw lightning

2040
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:36,779
Hopkins there and a few other amazing

2041
01:26:35,158 --> 01:26:38,279
people

2042
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:41,460
um so wild

2043
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:43,559
yeah and it opened and I think I have a

2044
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:47,039
photo of it in my

2045
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:50,940
um Chronicles I think in 64 it opened

2046
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:52,439
yeah I mean I was really a kid then but

2047
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:54,059
yeah um

2048
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:57,899
so

2049
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:59,880
the uh what what channel are we on now

2050
01:26:57,899 --> 01:27:01,379
oh well yeah I mean that's funny so so

2051
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:04,739
when I went when I was going to Boulder

2052
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:06,300
in the 90s it that hill was still a

2053
01:27:04,738 --> 01:27:08,819
place that you could go and buy weed and

2054
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:11,219
acid it had transformed and it was

2055
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:13,679
called it was called hippie Hill

2056
01:27:11,219 --> 01:27:15,300
nice right then

2057
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:17,219
um and it was still a spot that you

2058
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:19,440
could go and yeah you could get um

2059
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:22,139
obviously the the you know the type of

2060
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:25,198
weed had changed but the ability to go

2061
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:28,199
there and and meet someone and score a

2062
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:30,779
bag of weed uh and you know the cops

2063
01:27:28,198 --> 01:27:32,460
sort of tolerated it and tolerated a

2064
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:34,079
little bit of trade going on there or

2065
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,000
whatever so

2066
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:38,158
um it's a I didn't realize how early

2067
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,600
that had started

2068
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:41,939
um because at that point by the time

2069
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:44,100
that I had been going uh which was the

2070
01:27:41,939 --> 01:27:47,279
mid 90s late 90s it would have been

2071
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:49,860
ongoing that then for 30 some years

2072
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:52,679
right um but what the the thread we were

2073
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:56,519
on is I would love to know and I'm sure

2074
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:58,800
Matt would too what Rob or Sam told you

2075
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,480
about their skunk one lines

2076
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,159
like you know aside from the

2077
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:03,779
descriptions and stuff like that like

2078
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,599
what they told you about what was in

2079
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:08,759
them or why they were excited about them

2080
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,800
what got you excited about them to buy

2081
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,900
so many and then what your experience

2082
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,579
was like actually growing them in terms

2083
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:17,879
of like what they grew like what they

2084
01:28:14,579 --> 01:28:19,859
smelled like were they superior to the

2085
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,980
Mexicans you were growing anything like

2086
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:24,500
that would be probably wonderful to chat

2087
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:27,718
about

2088
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:31,800
well I met Rob through High Times he was

2089
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:33,899
he wrote articles a few and yeah at the

2090
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:36,779
end of the article he always put

2091
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:38,819
something like if you want to

2092
01:28:36,779 --> 01:28:40,859
um if you're interested in any of the

2093
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:42,840
things I wrote about or these seeds

2094
01:28:40,859 --> 01:28:46,979
you can contact me through the magazine

2095
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:48,960
so I wrote a letter to High Times to Rob

2096
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:51,059
and I put my phone number in there and

2097
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,219
he called me up and that's how we hooked

2098
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:55,679
up because the

2099
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:58,198
the first year I grew skunk I had

2100
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,819
already had two years actually three

2101
01:28:58,198 --> 01:29:02,219
years of growing before that but the

2102
01:28:59,819 --> 01:29:06,479
year before I made enough money that I

2103
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:08,819
could afford I when I saw and heard his

2104
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:11,399
description and other people's of skunk

2105
01:29:08,819 --> 01:29:12,960

01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:45,658
drove him up to Cottonwood where I lived

2119
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:46,559
he stayed a few days and

2120
01:29:45,658 --> 01:29:50,158
um

2121
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:54,300
again 5500 in cash and he was super

2122
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:55,979
happy when he came up he had this little

2123
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:59,159
um zip case that he pulled out of his

2124
01:29:55,979 --> 01:30:02,939
jacket and he had he had pre-rolled

2125
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:05,819
joints of Thai of Colombian of oaxacan

2126
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:08,099
of skunk number one and hit and he was

2127
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:10,439
standing there and he gave me one hit of

2128
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:12,120
something out in my living room and I

2129
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:13,500
was laying on the floor after that and

2130
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:15,599
he was just standing there talking away

2131
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:17,100
smoke and the rest of the whole joint

2132
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:21,480
and he said oh but you got to try this

2133
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:23,880
ties this time strain and I've never I

2134
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:26,579
my friend in Scottsdale who was I mean

2135
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:28,380
in Tempe who was the dealer he can smoke

2136
01:30:26,579 --> 01:30:31,019
like that my Colombian friend for sure

2137
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:34,800
he started smoking when he was seven in

2138
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:37,860
the Cali Colombia but my friend in Tempe

2139
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:40,739
he would roll 10 hash joints

2140
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:43,859
pin joints yeah just crumbled up hash

2141
01:30:40,738 --> 01:30:47,158
and smoke them in a day's time in 100

2142
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:49,920
degree striving a tractor that was his

2143
01:30:47,158 --> 01:30:54,119
motivation just chain smoke hash joints

2144
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:56,520
Jesus Rob was pretty much like that so I

2145
01:30:54,119 --> 01:30:58,800
I don't remember him describing to me

2146
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:02,520
what skunk was like it was what I read

2147
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,719
in high times that it just this skunky

2148
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:07,800
smell and

2149
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:09,800
it was going to be also have some exotic

2150
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:13,139
strains in it

2151
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:16,560
the original skunk number one didn't

2152
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:18,779
have Indian you know the Kerala India in

2153
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,539
it at all it was just

2154
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:23,880
three countries I think right

2155
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:27,779
um Colombian Mexican Afghan

2156
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:29,940
yep it was just those three and

2157
01:31:27,779 --> 01:31:32,460
I had smoked each of those individually

2158
01:31:29,939 --> 01:31:35,579
but the fact that this was a hybrid that

2159
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:37,380
was so potent and everything I don't

2160
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:39,420
know what I had read I have all those

2161
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:41,639
old High Times magazines I have the

2162
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:43,920
first High Times I have the first Black

2163
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:46,859
Belt Magazine I collect all kinds of

2164
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:50,399
weird [ __ ] I love that too

2165
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:52,259
yeah and memorabilia we'll get into that

2166
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:53,759
I'll I'll send you some things

2167
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:54,600
um through a collection you just let me

2168
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,800
know

2169
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,639
but

2170
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,460
um

2171
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:02,460
The Afghani number one

2172
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:05,219
I did get a few from him as a gift I

2173
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:07,380
think from buying all the skunk and it's

2174
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:10,859
funny because this says Afghani Hindu

2175
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:13,020
Kush hashish seeds I noticed his label

2176
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:15,299
and yet on the back he says this is

2177
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:18,000
skunk number one and I have one of these

2178
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:19,619
envelopes with Afghani number one

2179
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,219
um yeah so

2180
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:25,019
is kind of you know and he also has in

2181
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:27,420
letters here extra early

2182
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:29,940
so yeah I I was reading it it actually

2183
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:31,679
is a description for a pure Afghani is

2184
01:32:29,939 --> 01:32:33,479
what it is like the whole thing is a

2185
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,100
description for a pure unadulterated

2186
01:32:33,479 --> 01:32:36,238
Afghani but then it says skunk one right

2187
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:40,560
there

2188
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:42,899
these envelopes had two giant horse caps

2189
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,860
um with 50 seeds in each one so there

2190
01:32:42,899 --> 01:32:49,920
were 100 seeds in two big joke I mean

2191
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:52,259
cellulose caps yeah he'd get 50 cents in

2192
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,480
each one and

2193
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:56,880
I don't know what happened to the many

2194
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,379
many of these very different people over

2195
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,840
the years wanted one and I gave him one

2196
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:03,679
and my sure I think my my UK partner

2197
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,679
still has several

2198
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:06,840
um

2199
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:09,960
I don't know

2200
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:12,600
how else to Rob came down to our garden

2201
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:13,980
once and that's when he said he was

2202
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:15,719
amazed that we could grow out of dirt

2203
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:18,359
yeah

2204
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:22,079
you've never seen Arizona plants I don't

2205
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:25,979
think before and we averaged 6.8 ounces

2206
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:27,719
across our entire Garden per plant which

2207
01:33:25,979 --> 01:33:30,539
roughly almost a half a pound per plant

2208
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:32,939
which growing in the dirt yeah he said

2209
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:35,158
he was used to two three four pound

2210
01:33:32,939 --> 01:33:39,619
plants in Northern California you know

2211
01:33:35,158 --> 01:33:42,658
up in that black soil but um

2212
01:33:39,619 --> 01:33:45,719
well there's a there's a there's a

2213
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:47,339
volume you know thing too and like plant

2214
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:49,319
numbers

2215
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:51,060
um and so in in Northern California I

2216
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:53,279
mean some people went crazy but a lot of

2217
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:55,620
times people tried to

2218
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:57,000
um maximize how much they could get per

2219
01:33:55,619 --> 01:33:59,039
plant

2220
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,899
to not get you know so if they did get

2221
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:02,880
in trouble in Northern California it

2222
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:05,819
would be for Less plants

2223
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,679
that was a big thing so it's way way

2224
01:34:05,819 --> 01:34:09,960
easier and I think you get better weed

2225
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,000
growing up six or seven or eight ounce

2226
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,439
plant versus a four or five or six pound

2227
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,539
plant

2228
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:17,819
um but numbers did play a role at least

2229
01:34:15,539 --> 01:34:20,819
in Northern California where I'm from

2230
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:20,819
country

2231
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:25,138
did they what what were the type Aromas

2232
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:27,179
that you got off the skunk one that

2233
01:34:25,139 --> 01:34:31,199
first year you grew them

2234
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:33,480
if it was very it was very skunky note

2235
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:35,939
you know the smell of a skunk when you

2236
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:40,079
drive over it on the highway it was that

2237
01:34:35,939 --> 01:34:42,178
exact no it we were we were stupefied by

2238
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:44,460
it actually we were when this is

2239
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:47,579
incredible and it didn't smell like that

2240
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:51,300
growing so much but when you when it was

2241
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:53,698
harvested the flowers dried and you

2242
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,600
crush you know a flower and it was skunk

2243
01:34:53,698 --> 01:34:57,658
smell

2244
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:59,460
and it was pretty damn potent we rolled

2245
01:34:57,658 --> 01:35:01,559
a joint once and went to this topless

2246
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:04,619
club called the highlighter that we

2247
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:07,020
liked in Phoenix and

2248
01:35:04,619 --> 01:35:09,179
one of the two of the dancers we went in

2249
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:12,179
the ladies bathroom with two of the

2250
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:13,920
dancers and we each had one puff that's

2251
01:35:12,179 --> 01:35:15,539
all before we got busted by another

2252
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,340
dancer who came in and was in charge

2253
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:19,679
that night and said you guys have to get

2254
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:22,079
out of here and so we went and sat down

2255
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:25,020
the ladies I think they had one puff

2256
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:27,238
each more it was they were these were

2257
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:29,699
New York needles we called them or pin

2258
01:35:27,238 --> 01:35:32,099
joints where you had to really

2259
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:33,238
you know just to get a hit and we were

2260
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:36,420
sitting there and they came out of the

2261
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:38,698
bathroom they walked around the bar

2262
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:41,219
they were laughing and they smiled at us

2263
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:43,319
and then they walked right into a table

2264
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:45,960
knocked it over all the drinks went over

2265
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:48,059
they fell on the ground themselves and

2266
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:49,859
we were just sitting there laughing they

2267
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:52,860
were they had never been that high in

2268
01:35:49,859 --> 01:35:55,500
their life and we found out later that

2269
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:57,059
they were um scared almost

2270
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:02,158
I bet

2271
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:04,739
but you know in 1980 or 81

2272
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:06,658
there was you know we had already smoked

2273
01:36:04,738 --> 01:36:09,539
this sensimilla from Santa Barbara that

2274
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:11,519
was very Piney and I've and there was

2275
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:14,399
Thai weed around and other things but

2276
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,460
for some reason this thing packed a

2277
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:19,679
punch really quite a punch and

2278
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:22,679
I I don't know how people would rate it

2279
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,960
today compared to all these you know

2280
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:28,219
chem dogs and and all the other

2281
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:31,739
varieties that people have bred up to 35

2282
01:36:28,219 --> 01:36:33,779
THC or whatever they're at now

2283
01:36:31,738 --> 01:36:36,238
um but as you know the Entourage effect

2284
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:38,698
is what counts the total package you

2285
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:41,279
know the terpenes the bioflavonoids

2286
01:36:38,698 --> 01:36:44,279
everything everything someone said that

2287
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:46,619
the test on an original Afghani I mean

2288
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:51,000
uh skunk number one was it was only like

2289
01:36:46,619 --> 01:36:54,359
14 or 15 THC yeah most of the stuff I

2290
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,539
like Falls in between 8 to 18.

2291
01:36:54,359 --> 01:37:01,139
yeah so all the other ingredients the

2292
01:36:57,539 --> 01:37:03,179
terpenes perhaps that skunky terpene

2293
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:06,600
um profile

2294
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:08,340
and other things really added up

2295
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:11,940
it's really nice to have another account

2296
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:14,460
that isn't from Rob or Sam about skunk

2297
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:15,899
one having that same smell even back

2298
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:17,520
then because it's it's been heavily

2299
01:37:15,899 --> 01:37:19,799
debated for a long time whether that was

2300
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:22,260
true that skunk one had that smell or if

2301
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,360
it never happened yeah

2302
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:27,060
yeah because but

2303
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:29,399
the stuff that got sold in Europe

2304
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:31,800
um it sounds like Rob and and Sam or

2305
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:34,859
maybe Sam only kept breeding away from

2306
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:39,119
that Aroma and So eventually it became

2307
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:41,880
very floral very Citrus uh maybe a

2308
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:43,859
little cheese maybe some grapes

2309
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,560
um but people have been hunting for that

2310
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:50,099
skunky smell in Skunk everyone's seeds

2311
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:53,219
yeah ever since and yet it seems like it

2312
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:55,980
existed in the 70s and the early 80s and

2313
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:58,198
then it kind of went away

2314
01:37:55,979 --> 01:38:00,299
um and he maybe they successfully bred

2315
01:37:58,198 --> 01:38:02,399
it out of the line entirely because

2316
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:04,980
people have really hunted through skunk

2317
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:06,000
one trying to find recessives that are a

2318
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:08,399
throwback

2319
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,619
to what you just described

2320
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:15,238
hey uh

2321
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:20,399
so I uh I moved out to NorCal to grow

2322
01:38:15,238 --> 01:38:25,138
for a season and uh it was 1985 and when

2323
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:27,599
I first arrived in Ukiah I had taken a a

2324
01:38:25,139 --> 01:38:29,940
Greyhound bus and my instructions were

2325
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:33,000
to meet my new partners

2326
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:34,919
at the laundromat which was near the

2327
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,600
airport and the bus station I guess I'm

2328
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,119
not sure that's that part's a little

2329
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:42,020
fuzzy but I'll never forget you know

2330
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:46,079
arriving in Ukiah getting off the bus

2331
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:48,179
and as I'm walking towards the

2332
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:51,000
laundromat you know following the

2333
01:38:48,179 --> 01:38:55,760
instructions I'd been given the entire

2334
01:38:51,000 --> 01:39:00,779
town smelled like skunk

2335
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:02,880
the entire town I mean wow everywhere I

2336
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:05,039
walked and I I had to wait for a couple

2337
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,020
hours so after a while I got bored of

2338
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:10,019
standing around waiting for my buddy to

2339
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:12,719
drive down off the mountain and and you

2340
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:13,679
know pick me up so I I walked around a

2341
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:17,039
little bit

2342
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:19,319
the whole town smelled just like you

2343
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:23,039
know a roadkill you know people confuse

2344
01:39:19,319 --> 01:39:25,198
the Rotting Flesh roadkill part with a

2345
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:26,399
look when I when a skunk gets hit on the

2346
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:28,979
side of the road you don't smell

2347
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:31,979
anything but the skunk right

2348
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:35,399
it's not about rotting anything yes no

2349
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:39,059
yeah it's just that sulfurous uh you

2350
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:41,579
know that's been smashed yeah yeah I I

2351
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:44,600
live about 15 minutes for I can be in

2352
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:48,300
yukai in about 15 minutes from my house

2353
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:50,280
beautiful so you said 1885 that's the

2354
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:52,380
what part of where did you get that

2355
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:54,119
first year do you remember what part of

2356
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:57,659
of Mendocino you grew in do you remember

2357
01:39:54,119 --> 01:40:00,719
where you were now 1985 was the influx

2358
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:03,479
like the major major influx of indicas

2359
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,739
into that region I mean there of course

2360
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:06,539
there were some you know making their

2361
01:40:04,738 --> 01:40:08,939
way bits and pieces throughout the the

2362
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:11,039
70s and whatnot the 85 was like the

2363
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:12,779
smash year for indicas right out in that

2364
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:14,460
area so it makes sense a shitload of

2365
01:40:12,779 --> 01:40:17,219
skunk would be in that town

2366
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:19,698
you know the indicus that I grew in um

2367
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:24,480
in 81 and 82

2368
01:40:19,698 --> 01:40:28,319
uh were from NorCal from Ukiah and and

2369
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:30,238
you know the the towns around there and

2370
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:32,340
they were picked up by a friend of mine

2371
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:35,039
who was hitchhiking around there for for

2372
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:37,679
like two years and every time he'd he'd

2373
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:40,500
you know get picked up he would offer to

2374
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:43,020
to you know would you like hey I've got

2375
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:45,119
some weed do you want to smoke one and

2376
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:46,380
everybody always said yes but they said

2377
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,420
you know

2378
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:51,179
um let's not smoke yours here go in the

2379
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:52,560
glove compartment and let's let's smoke

2380
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:55,139
some of mine

2381
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:57,420
and he'd pull out the bag and here you

2382
01:40:55,139 --> 01:40:59,159
you roll it and we'll smoke it and as he

2383
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,719
rolled there were always a few seeds in

2384
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:06,420
there and he'd ask him if he could keep

2385
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:09,719
him yeah so my guy yeah I mean my my um

2386
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:13,139
my first interaction with Indigo was you

2387
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:17,219
know Christmas 81. he came back from

2388
01:41:13,139 --> 01:41:19,639
California to to visit and he had a

2389
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:23,698
collection of like six different

2390
01:41:19,639 --> 01:41:25,859
afghanis wow um and a story to go with

2391
01:41:23,698 --> 01:41:29,879
each one like there was one that he

2392
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:32,639
called Ranger weed and he had he had

2393
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:36,900
smoked this weed with a forest ranger

2394
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:39,600
like a and this guy had and it was I

2395
01:41:36,899 --> 01:41:42,179
swear it was it was what I think where

2396
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:45,480
Afghani number one came from it was a

2397
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:48,359
very coarse you know Afghani with kind

2398
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:48,959
of a candelabra style

2399
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:50,519
um

2400
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,100
you know

2401
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:56,580
uh attack there was another one he

2402
01:41:53,100 --> 01:42:00,659
called plain weed and uh this was on his

2403
01:41:56,579 --> 01:42:03,179
on his way home he he at SFO

2404
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:05,698
he was walking through the parking lot

2405
01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:07,739
and there's a guy sitting in a Corvette

2406
01:42:05,698 --> 01:42:10,439
convertible

2407
01:42:07,738 --> 01:42:13,259
um smoking weed right and he walked up

2408
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:14,698
and he gives him the look you know and I

2409
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:17,340
don't know if he you know held up his

2410
01:42:14,698 --> 01:42:20,279
finger like hey can we smoke and the guy

2411
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:23,219
invited him to join him in the car

2412
01:42:20,279 --> 01:42:25,859
and um you know he got a couple of seeds

2413
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:30,618
out of that encounter also that turned

2414
01:42:25,859 --> 01:42:34,738
out to be an an F1 Thai Afghani hybrid

2415
01:42:30,618 --> 01:42:36,779
which was just amazing and I knew what

2416
01:42:34,738 --> 01:42:40,198
exactly what it was because I had grown

2417
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:42,899
pure Thai the year before yeah right so

2418
01:42:40,198 --> 01:42:46,500
I had these pure afghanis and I had this

2419
01:42:42,899 --> 01:42:49,079
I had pure tie the year before

2420
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:51,899
and this stuff was just right in the

2421
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:54,118
middle it was a 50 50 cross and you know

2422
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:56,579
I used to sit there and make notes about

2423
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:59,339
you know I'd sit and smoke it and write

2424
01:42:56,579 --> 01:43:02,639
down the the effects and The Taste and

2425
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:04,860
compare it with other stuff and

2426
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:07,980
um just amazing notebooks right

2427
01:43:04,859 --> 01:43:09,299
yeah that's amazing I do yeah that when

2428
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:11,039
you first told me that you've kept these

2429
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:12,600
notebooks like on sense and stuff I was

2430
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,760
like man this guy's gonna be my best

2431
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:16,980
friend I'm telling you this is amazing

2432
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:19,139
like it's just it's it's only a certain

2433
01:43:16,979 --> 01:43:20,879
type of people that really get this far

2434
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:23,159
into weed I think

2435
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,000
um and and I a lot of us think it has

2436
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:26,519
something to do with being on the

2437
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,779
Spectrum you know because we we get so

2438
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:29,400
far into something so many people are

2439
01:43:27,779 --> 01:43:31,979
just like it's just weird smoke it and

2440
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:33,599
we're like I mean so much more one of

2441
01:43:31,979 --> 01:43:36,000
one of the one of the cool Parts about

2442
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:39,060
doing this uh these chats that Matt and

2443
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:42,840
I do is like the realization that like

2444
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:45,780
the vast majority of our history is oral

2445
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:47,699
right it's very little of it is very

2446
01:43:45,779 --> 01:43:50,579
little of it is written down you know

2447
01:43:47,698 --> 01:43:53,039
right and as people age evidence right

2448
01:43:50,579 --> 01:43:54,658
yeah yeah it was evidence and then so

2449
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:56,100
there's all these cool stories out there

2450
01:43:54,658 --> 01:43:58,500
and there's all these bits and pieces

2451
01:43:56,100 --> 01:44:01,739
like Matt had mentioned there was great

2452
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:03,738
debate like was Sam and and Rob lying

2453
01:44:01,738 --> 01:44:06,118
about how skunky it was in the beginning

2454
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:07,979
and you know because by the time they

2455
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:11,158
took skunk one to Amsterdam it was

2456
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:14,039
fruity and citrusy and floral and all

2457
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:16,138
that and so you know these these stories

2458
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:17,760
and stuff from from the region and what

2459
01:44:16,139 --> 01:44:20,340
things were like

2460
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:23,340
um is a big deal

2461
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:25,199
um because now people look at me and you

2462
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:27,539
know I'm only in my mid-40s you know but

2463
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:29,219
people think I'm old as [ __ ] and like

2464
01:44:27,539 --> 01:44:32,100
they want to hear like my stories from

2465
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:33,779
the 90s but your guys are stories from

2466
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:37,020
the 70s and 80s are like a full

2467
01:44:33,779 --> 01:44:38,698
generation beat before that are these

2468
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:42,060
old Mad Jack notebooks

2469
01:44:38,698 --> 01:44:43,919
yep oh my God that's amazing and your

2470
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:46,639
handwriting is so much better than mine

2471
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:50,219
it's just around

2472
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:51,900
everything yep they made it through the

2473
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:53,698
busts like the but like when you guys

2474
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:56,638
did get busted they didn't go after the

2475
01:44:53,698 --> 01:45:01,919
notebooks and stuff not so those a fees

2476
01:44:56,639 --> 01:45:06,719
came in in like 1980 81 not 85 and I

2477
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:10,020
grew I grew mine in 81 and 82 and I was

2478
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:13,739
the only one in practice you know that

2479
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:18,600
anybody in I knew that had this stuff

2480
01:45:13,738 --> 01:45:21,539
right yeah that year the very next year

2481
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:23,579
all of my friends had their own Affy

2482
01:45:21,539 --> 01:45:27,800
right that they'd gotten from different

2483
01:45:23,579 --> 01:45:30,658
sources from wherever you know I mean 83

2484
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:32,100
everybody had it it was making its way

2485
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:34,198
around the country probably through

2486
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:36,300
deadhead you know Dead shows and stuff

2487
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:38,099
like that let me ask you a question

2488
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:41,100
about that then

2489
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:42,239
um a lot of the old heads have said that

2490
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:44,159
you know

2491
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:46,079
um have told me that like basically like

2492
01:45:44,158 --> 01:45:47,698
Mendocino and Humboldt was almost pure

2493
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:50,158
sativa

2494
01:45:47,698 --> 01:45:52,259
um and people really like the buzz and

2495
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:53,939
the flavor and the effect and they said

2496
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:56,639
one of the big things that drove

2497
01:45:53,939 --> 01:45:58,500
indica's popularity was when in 81 when

2498
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:00,539
they started flying helicopters in my

2499
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:02,340
neck of the woods right getting

2500
01:46:00,539 --> 01:46:04,618
something that would finish in September

2501
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:06,060
or early October was a lot safer than

2502
01:46:04,618 --> 01:46:09,359
something that took till Thanksgiving

2503
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:11,159
and was this giant thing right yeah um

2504
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:13,500
and so that started spreading it because

2505
01:46:11,158 --> 01:46:15,899
police pressure and hiding it and all

2506
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:18,060
that became more important indicas were

2507
01:46:15,899 --> 01:46:19,799
shorter and squatter but a lot of people

2508
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:22,440
told me that that they didn't like the

2509
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:24,360
buzz as much maybe you could could you

2510
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:27,059
talk for a minute about your experiences

2511
01:46:24,359 --> 01:46:28,559
versus the the Mexicans and the ties and

2512
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:31,619
the Colombians and all those you were

2513
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:33,000
growing versus like smoking indicas at

2514
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:34,920
first and like what the differences were

2515
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,859
and what your preferences were

2516
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:40,739
yeah you know I mean and today what

2517
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:43,198
people think of is Indica usually is

2518
01:46:40,738 --> 01:46:45,359
some sort of hybrid

2519
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:48,299
um because the there were pure indicas

2520
01:46:45,359 --> 01:46:49,738
back then that had a very sedative

2521
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:54,480
effect

2522
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:58,500
without making your brain fuzzy

2523
01:46:54,479 --> 01:47:01,678
right I mean it was called

2524
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:04,198
yeah yeah calming and peaceful and kind

2525
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:07,139
of dreamy but it didn't give you that ER

2526
01:47:04,198 --> 01:47:09,839
you know that that that just you know

2527
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:12,380
the cow what we you know couch lock

2528
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:16,079
is not just a body effect it's it's a

2529
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:19,020
stunned mental effect right where your

2530
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:21,238
brain just kind of seizes up you know

2531
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:23,820
it's like distortion on a on a guitar

2532
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:25,919
exactly

2533
01:47:23,819 --> 01:47:28,198
um so you don't have to have that to

2534
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:30,300
have that body effect and most of what

2535
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:32,698
we experienced today

2536
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:35,639
um but with that Distortion with that

2537
01:47:32,698 --> 01:47:38,219
with that fuzz comes

2538
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:41,760
um you know it's usually got a lot of

2539
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:43,679
power to it right so some of these pure

2540
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:48,239
a fees would have would have actually

2541
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:49,260
been just kind of this just whoo slows

2542
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:50,939
it down

2543
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,880
right

2544
01:47:50,939 --> 01:47:56,299
um peaceful very high amazing taste

2545
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:59,520
right just like just like pure hash

2546
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:01,800
tasted exactly like hash

2547
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:04,020
um you know and

2548
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:06,779
at its best right

2549
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:08,820
um but without that that that inability

2550
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:11,039
to think you might be slowed down but

2551
01:48:08,819 --> 01:48:14,219
you could still you know follow a train

2552
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:17,460
of thought uh and eventually get there

2553
01:48:14,219 --> 01:48:20,939
but with and I think that you know skunk

2554
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:24,840
as it originally existed before Sam got

2555
01:48:20,939 --> 01:48:27,359
it and and hybridized it and used the

2556
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:30,060
name for the new thing that he created

2557
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:32,579
which was no longer what it what it was

2558
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:36,199
named after yeah

2559
01:48:32,579 --> 01:48:38,100
um if anybody can follow that right

2560
01:48:36,198 --> 01:48:39,899
blueberries the same to me it's the

2561
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:41,639
exact same thing I want to let you

2562
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:43,799
finish your thought but I'm gonna I'm

2563
01:48:41,639 --> 01:48:45,420
gonna come back to that to a part of

2564
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:48,000
what you just said in a moment but but

2565
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:49,980
please finish your thought so I mean you

2566
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,219
know skunk was very

2567
01:48:49,979 --> 01:48:56,698
um was very Afghani dominant back when

2568
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:57,719
it first came out and it was it hits you

2569
01:48:56,698 --> 01:49:00,419
like

2570
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:03,239
like a like a sledgehammer you know

2571
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:05,399
mentally it just stunned you

2572
01:49:03,238 --> 01:49:08,279
um you couldn't think you you were just

2573
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:10,019
you were just seized up and I think that

2574
01:49:08,279 --> 01:49:12,779
you know what we

2575
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:15,900
um think about as afghanis these days a

2576
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:18,779
fees indicas whatever you know the chem

2577
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:21,118
line is definitely you know got

2578
01:49:18,779 --> 01:49:22,859
hybridization going there with some kind

2579
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:25,380
of skunk

2580
01:49:22,859 --> 01:49:28,618
um which gives it you know a combination

2581
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:32,279
and that the extra power and the the

2582
01:49:28,618 --> 01:49:34,738
mental kind of Sledgehammer that you

2583
01:49:32,279 --> 01:49:35,460
know a lot of people like

2584
01:49:34,738 --> 01:49:38,579
um

2585
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:40,380
so contrasting you know you you went

2586
01:49:38,579 --> 01:49:42,420
into this with talking about what people

2587
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:44,579
used to grow up there in the mountains

2588
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:46,880
and as you're as you were just talking

2589
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:49,500
about it I was picturing Jim

2590
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,699
Richardson's book uh you know since

2591
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,760
Amelia

2592
01:49:50,698 --> 01:49:56,099
uh flowers

2593
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:57,780
right and the garden that he

2594
01:49:56,100 --> 01:50:00,179
photographed in there and took it

2595
01:49:57,779 --> 01:50:04,019
through the the phases of fluorescence

2596
01:50:00,179 --> 01:50:06,779
and documented it just so beautifully

2597
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:10,020
um you know I I first saw that book in I

2598
01:50:06,779 --> 01:50:12,658
guess 82 or 83 it

2599
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:16,080
um my my buddy had brought it back for

2600
01:50:12,658 --> 01:50:18,979
me and said that it was on every coffee

2601
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:21,960
table in Northern California

2602
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:23,519
it had the Big Sir hola weed and Dolores

2603
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:24,899
and all kinds of special plants in there

2604
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,520
that weren't labeled and a lot of people

2605
01:50:24,899 --> 01:50:28,618
don't know that that that's the original

2606
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:30,320
Big Surf holy weed and the tripweed and

2607
01:50:28,618 --> 01:50:33,179
yeah

2608
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:36,960
NorCal had had spent years you know

2609
01:50:33,179 --> 01:50:38,819
refining these imported sativa lines to

2610
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,679
turn them into things it would finish in

2611
01:50:38,819 --> 01:50:43,319
the season that they had there and and

2612
01:50:40,679 --> 01:50:46,199
you know selective breeding for quality

2613
01:50:43,319 --> 01:50:48,238
and yield and and

2614
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:50,219
um and finish time you know things that

2615
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:52,799
would work in the in the environment you

2616
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:55,500
had there and it was you know you would

2617
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:58,380
you had created something just as just

2618
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:01,198
as special as anything from Hawaii right

2619
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:03,539
as unique and special and uh those those

2620
01:51:01,198 --> 01:51:05,279
lines I think the last thing that we you

2621
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:07,319
know on the market today if somebody

2622
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:09,179
would go out and look for seeds that

2623
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:11,279
they could grow that would be similar to

2624
01:51:09,179 --> 01:51:14,399
that or would at least give them you

2625
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:17,099
know a hint of what it used to be would

2626
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:19,099
be if they could find a good early Pearl

2627
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:22,619
yeah

2628
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:25,320
right because you can still taste the

2629
01:51:22,618 --> 01:51:27,539
Mexican in there and the effects still

2630
01:51:25,319 --> 01:51:29,519
have that it's still there yes there's

2631
01:51:27,539 --> 01:51:31,800
an Affy thrown in there and a half year

2632
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,199
two in the mix sure of you know

2633
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:38,460
different sativas but but the sweet

2634
01:51:34,198 --> 01:51:42,299
Neville called it the awaken zing

2635
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:45,719
right and uh it's it's a you know when

2636
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:48,179
grown as Cincinnati by by a gardener who

2637
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:50,520
loves what he's doing you know small

2638
01:51:48,179 --> 01:51:54,179
numbers and and pampered and cared for

2639
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:55,920
it's it's so tasty and delicious that

2640
01:51:54,179 --> 01:51:58,260
there's hardly anything that can come

2641
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:01,500
close yeah I'm a sucker for the silver

2642
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:03,300
Pearl still but um I you know I really

2643
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:05,340
want early girl because that's one that

2644
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:08,520
I've never ran but early Pearl was a big

2645
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:11,880
favorite in San Diego too amazing stuff

2646
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:14,520
yeah so those you know early girl when

2647
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:17,760
Pollyanna were you know from that that

2648
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,380
era and from that region and uh they

2649
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,780
were some of the some of those early

2650
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:24,118
hybrids when when the first athies

2651
01:52:21,779 --> 01:52:25,979
showed up and they said well wow this is

2652
01:52:24,118 --> 01:52:27,658
the greatest thing ever you know can you

2653
01:52:25,979 --> 01:52:29,519
imagine growing a couple of these things

2654
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:32,158
in your garden and never seeing anything

2655
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:33,840
like it and falling in love with the

2656
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:35,399
hash and the first thing you're gonna do

2657
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,199
is you're gonna say I'm going to take

2658
01:52:35,399 --> 01:52:40,079
this new thing which is the best thing

2659
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:42,118
ever and cross it with the best thing

2660
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:45,059
that that I've spent the last 10 years

2661
01:52:42,118 --> 01:52:46,920
making yeah right that's exactly the

2662
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:50,580
first thing you're gonna do right yep

2663
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:52,560
and uh in Mendo you kind of have till

2664
01:52:50,579 --> 01:52:55,439
Halloween or maybe the first week of

2665
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:58,380
November if you get lucky

2666
01:52:55,439 --> 01:53:00,899
um of of a good chance of reasonably

2667
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:02,340
good weather and not too much rain and

2668
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:04,679
then the cold and the rain and the

2669
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:07,560
weather starts to turn so breeding

2670
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:09,480
breeding and Mendo and Humboldt

2671
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:11,880
um you know you kind of have to have

2672
01:53:09,479 --> 01:53:13,738
some Halloween weed at the latest maybe

2673
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:15,480
some early November

2674
01:53:13,738 --> 01:53:17,099
um but you really can't like trying to

2675
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:20,638
push things full outside till

2676

2692
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:58,560
bit uh yeah there's a million things I

2693
01:53:56,100 --> 01:54:00,800
could talk about I'm intrigued at all of

2694
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:03,719
the memorabilia

2695
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:05,340
for sure uh and the experience I used to

2696
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:07,500
drool I mean Sam used to post on

2697
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:08,880
overgrown the Breeders breeder on you

2698
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:11,579
know in the Breeders segment back then

2699
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,859
in the forums a lot of those old school

2700
01:54:11,579 --> 01:54:15,420
uh pictures and stuff like that and art

2701
01:54:13,859 --> 01:54:17,099
that would get made with certain kinds

2702
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:19,440
of people's weed

2703
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:23,340
um and that that whole like sort of it's

2704
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:25,138
like pre-marketing of anonymous Growers

2705
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:27,659
was super neat

2706
01:54:25,139 --> 01:54:29,760
um and just uh so yeah there's a million

2707
01:54:27,658 --> 01:54:31,439
directions we could go but as Matt said

2708
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,239
we only have four minutes before it'll

2709
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:37,019

2728
01:55:23,579 --> 01:55:29,519
that live in Sedona and I said well what

2729
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:34,159
is it on a scale of 10 and they said 9.3

2730
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:34,159
I said well it's good we'll call it 9.3

2731
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:41,579
yeah so instead of some fancy you know
