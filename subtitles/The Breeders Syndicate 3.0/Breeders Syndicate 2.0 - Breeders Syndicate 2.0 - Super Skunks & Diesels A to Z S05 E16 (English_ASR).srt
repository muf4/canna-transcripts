explore the history of a clandestine

7
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,640
scene Through The Eyes of the folks who

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,500
lived it I'm Matthew owner of Red seeds

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,899
I'll occasionally be joined by my

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,100
co-host not so dog breeder and grower

11
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,840
from Mendocino

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,840
welcome to the underground

13
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,179
hello I think this is working I think

14
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:58,979
we're live so I think we're good you

15
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,079
think we're good yeah I think we're good

16
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:02,099
we can rock it so tonight we're going to

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,739
do

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,739
um the Diesels A to Z I know we've

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,140
covered it before sometimes Ad nauseam

20
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,519
we cover Super Skunk stuff however I

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,739
think this is going to be a good way to

22
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,959
do it with our new platform being able

23
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,000
to illustrate with pictures and whatnot

24
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,459
so I wanted to be able to do kind of

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,438
like a documentary style thing with uh

26
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,199
pretty much not so narrating as we go

27
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,059
along and covering what we can of the

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,359
diesel story which means we're not going

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,359
to touch as much on the uh oh we lost

30
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,938
the not so which means we're not gonna

31
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:40,500
touch on as much of the

32
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:43,758
chem story I think am I still here

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,759
is this still live everyone

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,180
all right

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,680
oh there he is okay just making sure I

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,759
have no idea what happened I think that

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,740
was my fat thumb to be honest

38
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,780
we'll put that up to a fat thumb mistake

39
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,559
where I hit the wrong button that's all

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,340
right

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,379
um

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,060
yeah see we're live again see now you

43
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,618
guys know we're live this time

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,000
um so yeah we wanted to cover it all

45
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,978
we're not going to jump as much into the

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
chems because we've you know we've

47
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,280
covered a lot of the chems but we do

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,099
want to do a serious diesel presentation

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,479
so without much further Ado where you

50
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:19,439
want to start

51
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:21,659
I mean I uh you know

52
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,639
we're we're gonna rehash this obviously

53
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,340
or whatever so there's and maybe we

54
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,019
decided that since it's the Thanksgiving

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,539
holiday that we could pick a subject

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,640
that everybody likes to argue about yeah

57
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,739
um because it's one of those ones where

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,598
uh you know whenever you talk about it

59
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,120
some people are happy some people are

60
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,339
are I think you're wrong on some parts

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,819
of it and some people are offended

62
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,800
yeah right yeah definitely whenever we

63
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,659
do this every there is definitely going

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,060
to be people offended it just is what it

65
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,739
is so you know it's just as like a

66
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,539
disclaimer this is like everything that

67
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,360
we're saying is like the best as we know

68
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,098
it yeah you know new information pops up

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,959
at different times sometimes it's good

70
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:03,899
sometimes not

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
um but you know it's uh it's it you know

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,680
it's all wrapped up in one of those

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,780
things where it became one of the most

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,219
famous strains in America for a while

75
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,219
yes

76
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:16,199
um and then so how it originated uh gets

77
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,539
battled about and because it happened in

78
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,000
the 90s when there was a lot of secrecy

79
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:24,179
it took relatively speaking a long time

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,699
yeah for the story to come out and

81
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,959
for which people involved decided to

82
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,759
speak when

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,979
yeah there's a lot of claimants to the

84
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,479
throne of uh diesel there there's no

85
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,280
shortage to that that's for sure and

86
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,139
which cut is the original

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,759
you know and so from like so there's

88
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,098
different perspectives on it right any

89
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,318
obviously anytime one of the ways that

90
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:45,658
people get rep in the Cannabis Community

91
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,658
or whatever is having some kind of tie

92
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:51,120
or even responsibility perhaps for like

93
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:54,120
a famous cut or a famous line

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,879
it's one of the best ways to get like

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Canna longevity and fame I guess you

96
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,079
could say the best way to start a seed

97
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,839
company to kick off a seed company yes

98
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,340
definitely that for sure especially if

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,280
you're offering a clone that like other

100
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,140
people don't have very much right so

101
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,080
um you know so there's that aspect of it

102
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,019
but then there's also the aspect is like

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,079
sour and diesels became popular uh in

104
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,699
the pre-marketing era of cannabis

105
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,280
um they sort of became organically

106
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,919
popular and then the more popular they

107
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,019
became uh the more people hunted them

108
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,060
out to like you know to find more of it

109
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,620
and then the more it got grown and then

110
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,319
it sort of became a self-fulfilling

111
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,418
prophecy yeah where eventually sour

112
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,579
became popular enough that like

113
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:42,659
literally you know people talked about

114
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:45,359
diesel as gas yeah and gas operated like

115
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,939
a whole section of the market

116
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,800
it still does it's still the huge I mean

117
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,839
every day I get emails asking what do

118
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,400
you got that's gas I need the gas you

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,918
know almost more than anything people

120
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,079
still demand gas you know and I think

121
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,000
it's I think it's a number of factors so

122
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,800
it's interesting you can you can hit

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,660
sour from all these different angles and

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,340
as Matt said

125
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,660
um you know we're we'll eventually get

126
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,539
to the point where we start chatting

127
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,280
about like specific cuts and things like

128
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,819
that but like maybe even like a more

129
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,698
General start right so

130
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,199
you know uh diesel

131
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,478
um and it's beginning and this is some

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,780
confusion out there but diesel was slang

133
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:28,740
for good weed in New York in that era

134
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:31,619
yeah right like so just so people know

135
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,360
there wasn't like a specific cut or a

136
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,459
specific something that came out where

137
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,100
before that name had never been

138
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:40,079
associated with wheat

139
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,360
right because that's what happens a lot

140
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,819
of times with famous strains yeah you

141
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,600
know is they is uh

142
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:51,659
um so you know so diesel came out and

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,560
Diesel was just slang for good weed and

144
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,680
then

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,319
Sour Diesel came out and you know these

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,478
diesel cuts and it became so famous that

147
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,819
it pretty much swamped anything that had

148
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:06,538
been called diesel before

149
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:09,300
right yep it became the diesel

150
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,339
right and so you know there was there's

151
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,259
other things out there that were you

152
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,599
know that people call diesel back in the

153
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,460
day and it eventually got swamped by

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,800
this one family

155
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:22,079
this is the family now do you want to

156
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,079
start about to talk about

157
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,240
um what the original thoughts were that

158
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,459
the diesel was I mean I remember when we

159
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,840
first got on the forums it was uh a lot

160
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,638
of people were saying it was just you

161
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,060
know bag seed and that was it

162
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,579
you know well that's pretty much held up

163
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,259
self-chem 91. you know that I don't

164
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,120
think is held up

165
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,160
um just because now we've gotten a

166
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,280
chance to look through a whole bunch of

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,439
chem 91 s1s yeah

168
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,239
um and and so it's definitely got other

169
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:55,379
influences to it but I do think it's

170
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,819
true that it it was it was some Bag seed

171
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,319
um it just it there's a little bit more

172
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,780
to the story than that obviously and

173
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,720
that's where the confusion comes in yeah

174
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:07,079
um but it seems relatively safe to say

175
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,380
that it's some combination of

176
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:13,800
um you know uh chem and you know Cam and

177
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:16,439
skunk there we go so here's the dog your

178
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,720
your old favorite right indeed this is

179
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,259
an old High Times photo I I assume it

180
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,620
was taken of maybe from G's You Know

181
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,538
Places yeah not a hundred but I assume

182
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,720
so

183
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:32,879
and then you know I mean it's not the

184
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,500
most photogenic plant ever

185
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,240
um it has a lot of traits that are very

186
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,759
distinctive you know we've talked about

187
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,579
them before the the leaf cannibalism

188
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,379
trait it's not uh everyone's favorite it

189
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,079
doesn't make for a great finish Bud

190
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:49,139
either no

191
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,959
it doesn't yeah I have a few more uh

192
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:55,139
good shots of 91. I want to mostly give

193
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,779
people an idea of

194
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,699
how it will breed so looking at the

195
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,439
traits of the dog here's some more

196
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,259
um this is I think

197
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,660
Jimmy knits grow oh we're seeing in 2007

198
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,580
seven thumbnails right now so you're not

199
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,680
actually giving us very much

200
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,598
let me see what's going on here okay so

201
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,939
it's not sharing it again

202
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:19,800
I gotta get good at this let's see share

203
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:21,899
screen window where there we go chair

204
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,939
there we go so this is Jimmy knits

205
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,239
pictures of it

206
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:29,759
and this is the dog so we're looking at

207
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,099
some of the traits of the dog here and

208
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,680
you will see some of these pass on to

209
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,919
what we see later on so if you go back a

210
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,718
second that pick right there right yep

211
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,918
uh especially with the with what the

212
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,360
leaf does you know I can see that in

213
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,579
sour

214
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
yeah you can see it in sauer's progeny

215
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,220
too

216
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,778
you know and people if people want to

217
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,820
take note you can kind of take note of

218
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:56,278
like the dark leaves

219
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,680
right and some of the structure it's

220
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,860
obviously not exact by any means dog is

221
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,479
much more of kind of a stouter afghan

222
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,339
um it is a little bit leggy but nothing

223
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,320
like the diesel

224
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,000
um but it does I do think some of that

225
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,740
bud structure and some of those dark

226
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,799
leaves and some of the way the leaves

227
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,339
yellow and brown uh is pretty

228
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,319
characteristic of uh the chem dog

229
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,940
and here's an old cam dog picture from

230
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,920
high times as well in the upper right

231
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,480
corner

232
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,979
you know a different way of growing it

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,420
obviously

234
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,580
different style

235
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,019
yeah I mean it's she certainly comes out

236
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,399
in different ways and so just so people

237
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,879
know

238
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:40,159
um what's generally agreed upon uh is

239
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:42,299
that sour is some combination of chem 91

240
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,120
and skunk

241
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:48,059
and to illustrate that

242
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,560
I will bring this up let's see

243
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:55,018
and that's kind of where the uh some of

244
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,819
the some of the Guff comes in I think in

245
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,500
terms of like what people say it is

246
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,080
right

247
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,179
um yeah there's a there's a Polaroid

248
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,060
from skunk VA about some of the old

249
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,799
Super Skunk

250
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:13,379
I also think you can see Sour Diesel

251
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:16,979
traits in in that pick yeah you know

252
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:19,080
um so to me uh it's basically a chem

253
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,539
skunk I've grown a lot of Kemp's Gunk

254
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,700
hybrids uh I'm not saying it's it's

255
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:26,519
exactly that nothing else it could even

256
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,560
have a couple of Herms in between but I

257
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,759
mean the general story is that these

258
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,859
guys got

259
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,679
um you know they were getting some they

260
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:38,100
were getting some uh some supposed chem

261
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:40,859
dog either that or a hybrid from uh this

262
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,600
dude and they found seeds in it and they

263
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,539
collected those seeds and they popped

264
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,100
them in the summer in 95 and they got a

265
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,559
couple cuts that they kept and they

266
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,180
called them diesel one and diesel two

267
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:58,259
right yep uh and then and then they gave

268
00:10:54,179 --> 00:11:02,039
some weed of that uh marked our diesel

269
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:03,480
to their homie who grew it out and uh he

270
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,000
found some seed

271
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,680
and he thought that the hour diesel had

272
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,940
an s in front of it and so he thought he

273
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,939
it was called Saudis

274
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:18,958
right so we know the mom of Sour Diesel

275
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:21,838
because we know the bud that the uh the

276
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,578
weed came out of the seeds yeah yeah

277
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,160
that we know that we know the weed that

278
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:28,799
the seeds came out of yes sorry so we

279
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,439
know the mom for sure it was this it was

280
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,819
this cut and oh and it's also just so

281
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
people know because it started another

282
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,000
Legend

283
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,640
um the mom of it they called diesel 2

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,519
but some people called it headband

285
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,679
and so because there was this mystery of

286
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,120
the what the New York headband actually

287
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:51,479
was there's a whole field of headband

288
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,480
cuts that claim to be that one yeah the

289
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,519
first original you know uh New York City

290
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
headband

291
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,000
right there's some these are some really

292
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,739
early picks ones from High Times ones

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,320
from Canada Bible of different Sour

294
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,639
Diesel cuts and then in the bottom right

295
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,278
corner here you should you could

296
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,958
probably be able to see the headband

297
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,778
as it was stated in the Canna Bible

298
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,159
which is yeah so there's nothing there's

299
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:16,379
different ones and then there was a few

300
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,419
there's a few OG strains that got their

301
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,519
name changed a headband which added to

302
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,078
the confusion yeah

303
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,539
um you know then there's names bandied

304
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,359
about like day wrecker which man is more

305
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:30,240
this headband looks pretty cushy in this

306
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,039
picture yeah you know and so and so it

307
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,980
added to a bunch of confusion because

308
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,719
outside of a really small circle there

309
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,579
wasn't really any confirmation on

310
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,459
exactly what the famous New York City

311
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:43,919
headband was yeah nor did people know

312
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:46,078
that it was Mom of Sour Diesel

313
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,719
that's great for a long time for a long

314
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,399
time that was not known yeah that was a

315
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,200
tidbit that came out pretty much in

316
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,019
recent years I think that was confirmed

317
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,000
yeah you know and so as a result of that

318
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,480
like Matt knows a little this better

319
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,159
than me but like in terms of the forums

320
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,860
wasn't it like there was a bunch of

321
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:09,319
stuff like it came out of the RH the RFK

322
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:12,060
skunk yeah and there was

323
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,800
uh there was all these theories bandied

324
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:17,539
about about a much more complicated

325
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:20,939
lineage right yeah Hawaiian RFK skunk

326
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:23,458
uh uh Northern Lights yeah

327
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,680
that was the theory JJ put forward for

328
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,458
it and and it was a decent Theory you

329
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,259
know

330
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,719
um I don't think it turned panned out

331
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,639
very well because our estate RFK skunk

332
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,259
was being passed around at the time it

333
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,700
was in the same kind of room so a lot of

334
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:37,740
the same Crews were growing it so it was

335
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,040
it was it was a decent Theory

336
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,100
no and I mean I also think too that like

337
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,599
much more so than theories it's like you

338
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,120
have different people that are that are

339
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,060
involved in the scene or whatever yeah

340
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,679
um that come along and they tell their

341
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:54,539
version of it and other people are

342
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,599
staying quiet

343
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:59,338
right yeah and so for you know for a lot

344
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,800
of times in a lot of cannabis Stories

345
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,560
the people that come out first with the

346
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:07,319
first story get get the most rep

347
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,419
yep that's why that um OG Kush story

348
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,420
about the lemon Pakistani and all that

349
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:14,458
still is passed down this day like like

350
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,500
biblical because people really but

351
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,239
that's real to be honest regardless of

352
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,519
all that before we get into it like a

353
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,039
discussion about like the various the

354
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,799
various versions of it sort of what

355
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,679
happened in my opinion is that

356
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,559
um you know the east coast is is a is a

357
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,179
big consumer area and they loved it and

358
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,759
I think that

359
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:38,159
um it worked really well uh it had a

360
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,860
really good Zippy up high

361
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,759
it got people super baked it tasted

362
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,919
great

363
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,860
it had a pungent and very distinctive

364
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,319
nose and I also think the nose lasted

365
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,759
for a while and didn't fade very fast so

366
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,320
yeah when people were bringing it

367
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,000
different places like that that

368
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,339
persisted

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
and so it just became something that

370
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,360
people knew when they bought was

371
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,459
consistent and good yeah and so

372
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,800
completely separate from the lineage the

373
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:07,500
vast majority of people that grew ever

374
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,078
grew Sour Diesel knew almost nothing of

375
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,778
what we just talked about yeah they got

376
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,059
this cut as sour diesel or sour or

377
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,159
whatever and people would buy it for for

378
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,958
a good month for a good chunk and they

379
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,059
like to smoke it and so all kinds of

380
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,859
people started growing yeah I mean on

381
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,719
the west coast in Mendo and Humboldt it

382
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,940
was a huge thing

383
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,459
you know because it was it was like

384
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,459
growing modern skunk weed

385
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:34,859
it got big it was Fluffy

386
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,719
um it took quite a while it wasn't the

387
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,680
easiest outdoor plant it did great in

388
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,300
depths

389
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,338
right yeah

390
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:43,019
um and it was it was kind of funny

391
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,579
inside depending it was temperature

392
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,320
dependent

393
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:48,239
um and a lot of times

394
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,540
um people you know it should go probably

395
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,180
like 10 or 11 12 weeks maybe even 13

396
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,578
depending on the Fino and most people

397
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,259
will take it would take it back in the

398
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:00,958
day as soon as they could get away with

399
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,639
getting the nose on it yeah so there was

400
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,159
a lot of sour that was that was

401
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,698
harvested between 60 and 65 days that

402
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:11,458
probably should have gone 70 or 75 yeah

403
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:13,078
in all honesty is this the uh the one

404
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,939
that I have up here do you are you

405
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,379
familiar with this one the super leafy

406
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,300
looking one

407
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:20,578
you know I think that's the way it was

408
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:23,819
grown

409
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:25,198
um and I don't I don't remember where he

410
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,778
took that one

411
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,939
so I can't really say I've seen people

412
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,100
put up pictures of a plant that looks

413
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,779
very similar to this one saying yeah I

414
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,699
got the original diesel one from the

415
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:37,259
camera Bible but I just never really

416
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:38,819
been able to confirm it just because it

417
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,579
looks so different than any of the uh

418
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,519
ways I've seen diesel grown I mean it

419
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:48,120
seems like the thing about the the thing

420
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,339
about the bag seed beginning is that it

421
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,440
uh which I don't know which way is the

422
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,360
best way to put it but it seems like

423
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,480
that multiple people got multiple bag

424
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,639
seeds even early on yeah yeah and so

425
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,320
there was probably you know at least

426
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,639
there was a couple things that were

427
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,519
diesel there was a thing that was

428
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,078
headband there was a couple sours I mean

429
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,058
even the people that tell the story say

430
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,918
the guy that found Sour Diesel he had a

431
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:12,240
couple of Finos but only one got out

432
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,579
yeah

433
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,019
you know I also um real quick for

434
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,720
anybody listening to the audio version

435
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:20,338
of this after we upload it later

436
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,078
um I highly recommend watching the

437
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,359
episode because there's a lot more to it

438
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,959
with visual aids and stuff so definitely

439
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,599
if you listen to it go back and re-watch

440
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,240
go ahead yeah so it got it got really

441
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,859
popular in the sense that it was uh it's

442
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,500
one in my mind it's one of the best

443
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:39,538
families of cannabis out there yeah it

444
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,660
has a really nice high it burns really

445
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:44,519
well it's not overly dense

446
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,440
um which is good in my opinion when it

447
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,418
comes to taking bong hits or smoking a

448
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,400
joint or anything like that I I think

449
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,860
burnability is like an overlooked

450
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,798
component yeah I I totally agree even

451
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:57,538
even breakup ability like it's it's

452
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,179
really obnoxious to have to try to break

453
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,919
up these big ass dense nugs I don't know

454
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,780
they don't break up that well I mean

455
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,400
this might be dumb or whatever but like

456
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,339
one of the things that I like to breed

457
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,019
for is like you know wheat is convenient

458
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:11,759
when it's like in the dark at a concert

459
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,500
and you can break off a chunk with your

460
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,759
hand and stuff it into a pipe and that's

461
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,619
all you need to do and you can then

462
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,839
smoke it yeah

463
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,939
right that's a good trait good good

464
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,899
quality it's a good well it also makes

465
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,400
this thing where there's a certain

466
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,038
amount when you're burning stuff there's

467
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,620
a certain amount of like air to air to

468
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,720
material ratio that helps it burn

469
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:32,399
yeah and then that makes you get a good

470
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,440
a good hit or not and so I think

471
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,960
Diesel's burned really well so they were

472
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,880
like a pretty effective delivery device

473
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,279
as far as getting buzzed

474
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,480
how do you think the Grateful Dead came

475
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:47,038
in to play with the popularity of diesel

476
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,980
I mean that's that comes into play

477
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:53,220
really early on yeah yeah well I mean

478
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,400
you know for one thing uh if if we're

479
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,160
correct in that uh you know chemdog is

480
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,140
the beginning of it or whatever that

481
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,380
like you know the seeds that came that

482
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,020
became chem dog uh were acquired at a

483
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,919
dead show yeah you know it was bag seed

484
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,859
there

485
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,900
um and you know I I do think and in in

486
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,879
terms of like the 90s especially it's

487
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,480
not so much like this anymore

488
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,660
but in terms of the 90s uh Grateful Dead

489
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,579
hippies were sort of the highway

490
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:26,640
epicenter of the American weed Market

491
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,139
yeah you know it's there's a lot of

492
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,640
different groups that grow now and I'm

493
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,820
not saying obviously they were the only

494
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,820
people but like you know uh kind bud

495
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:38,460
sort of started uh being regularly

496
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:39,359
spread about through Dead shows and

497
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,220
hippies

498
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,639
yeah there was a lot of them growing it

499
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,679
and so as a result of that like you know

500
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,380
uh the the people Sour Diesel came from

501
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,700
were essentially hippies yeah they like

502
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,320
to go see the Grateful Dead they like to

503
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,640
go see Fish

504
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,740
um you know it was the kids that like to

505
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,360
go party and have a good time and and

506
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,700
see some music

507
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,519
and that brought together people from

508
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,440
disparate parts of America yeah which

509
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,819
means that mixed strains and that mixed

510
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,679
seeds and people brought those things

511
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,418
home you know they brought it from

512
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,780
California to wherever it went to New

513
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:17,400
York it it moved around yeah it

514
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:20,639
definitely did so you know uh I think at

515
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,880
the time probably like the uh Grateful

516
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,059
Dead was like um sort of like America's

517
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,559
last nomadic tribe of people

518
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,599
it's an interesting way of looking at it

519
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,160
it's true yeah you know we were they

520
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,779
were kind of like the Roma you know they

521
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,759
were kind of like gypsies in a way yeah

522
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:39,240
like you know three quarters of the year

523
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,099
they tripped around the country yeah

524
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,038
and they and they had to figure out a

525
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:46,139
way to survive going from town to town

526
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,240
and one of the ways they survived was by

527
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,700
hustling wheat yeah

528
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,500
and you know so

529
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,240
um it was found at a dead show and then

530
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,038
it like and then they were growing it

531
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,679
and selling it to other hippies and then

532
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,058
it it harmed and then it harmed again

533
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,679
and

534
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,259
and so on and so forth I don't think

535
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,360
that's true anymore yeah um there's no

536
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,579
tour like that anymore and like you know

537
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,519
growing cannabis especially has gone

538
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:14,159
into all kinds of walks of life yeah for

539
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,720
sure you know uh you know so but for a

540
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,279
minute there it was kind of like it was

541
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,140
spread around by a lot of people that

542
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,139
were like that or connected to that yeah

543
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,259
so

544
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,859
which one did you want to cover next

545
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,599
um

546
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:30,119
which direction did you want to go so

547
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,558
really what we could do is I think let's

548
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,079
put it this way right there was two

549
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,298
different things going on uh there was a

550
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,099
scene in New York that was kind of small

551
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:41,000
and indoor based where people were

552
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:44,939
getting crazy digits for sour right

553
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,440
people like AJ and Manny various various

554
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,538
different groups and then it made its

555
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,640
way west because it was easier because

556
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:52,500
with 215 in California and other places

557
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,140
it was easier to grow more of it in the

558
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,839
west yeah but it was still it was still

559
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:01,140
supplying that initial demand back there

560
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:03,418
yeah right and I think for a while it

561
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,640
was just Sour Diesel

562
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,880
there was no other name or qualifier

563
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,140
given yeah and I would say maybe in me

564
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,299
you can correct me if you think I'm

565
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,679
wrong but I think that the forums is

566
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:16,200
where these all these other names

567
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,419
started to percolate around yeah I would

568
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,700
think so so from like let's say the mid

569
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,820
90s when it came out to like the early

570
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,200
2000s was their names or was it all just

571
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:27,359
Sour Diesel

572
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,298
I you know I wouldn't know that's prior

573
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,119
to my time so I think you guys all just

574
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,740
I think my you know I mean I got my cut

575
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,779
uh and it was helpful it was helpfully

576
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,819
called sourdie yeah

577
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:42,359
and pretty helpful yeah it was very

578
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:45,058
helpful uh and uh you know and then as

579
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,219
the forums happened that's the beginning

580
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:49,980
of like people needing to identify like

581
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,720
where strains come from yeah so then you

582
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,960
get like stuff like oh what is this this

583
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,779
is the choco yeah this is the East this

584
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,179
is the this is the shroomy

585
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:03,839
right yep um what were some of the other

586
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,759
early names of sour uh Amish was one I

587
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,558
mean I think that was one of the shroomy

588
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,460
other names for sharumi because they

589
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:10,379
were yeah because because because

590
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,659
shroomi was supposedly from Pennsylvania

591
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,659
so it was sometimes called his name or

592
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,400
Amish I called it uh Cobb sometimes

593
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,780
because Cobb did amazing grows of it

594
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,640
when people would ask me I'd be like ah

595
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:22,379
either look at Chacos he's got a great

596
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,059
grow of it or cause right look at

597
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,679
chocolate or like yeah why did you know

598
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:29,220
every there's a lot of people that call

599
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,500
the dog the the skunk Vie a cut yeah why

600
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,819
because he was online talking about it

601
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,339
and they were trying to figure out a way

602
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:37,500
to label the specific thing he was

603
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,538
talking about and so oh it's a so it's

604
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,759
this one yeah right

605
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:44,339
and so the same thing happened with sour

606
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,200
diesel and what's funny about that is

607
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,339
that Sour Diesel goes through phases

608
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,819
where

609
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:52,619
if it's good sour nobody gives a [ __ ]

610
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:54,418
and then it goes through a phase where

611
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,099
lineage is important and people try to

612
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,419
track down lineage and then it goes

613
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:00,359
through a phase where it's not important

614
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,940
and if it's good sour it's good sour and

615
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,158
now we're in a phase again where

616
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,080
um lineage is really important being the

617
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,659
first one is important and having the

618
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,699
real deal is important

619
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:15,480
um but there's probably like 15 or 20

620
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,519
different Sour Diesel names yeah even

621
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,279
more so now in the past

622
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,619
three years I'd say many more have

623
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,200
popped up so many more so many more

624
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:26,879
I mean so we've got like like just the

625
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,740
ones I think off off my head that people

626
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,340
talk about like you East Coast Sour

627
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,380
Diesel New York City Diesel

628
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:35,819
right Amish

629
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,020
choco

630
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:40,019
uh PTSD ecsd

631
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,298
um the dhk cut was one the devil's

632
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:47,519
Harvest crew cut dhk cut there was also

633
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,139
the dark heart Nursery cut the dhn cuts

634
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,158

635
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,159
oh no

636
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,859
I think I'm still going I don't know if

637
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,960
he should outer

638
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,839
I did

639
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,960
let me know if you all see this

640
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,459
are you there yeah

641
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,159
yeah I'm alive I don't know what

642
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,679
happened but anyway all right uh I don't

643
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,179
know how far Matt got with me the dark

644
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,480
part Nursery cut

645
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,159
um so we have the dhn the dhk

646
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,460
uh

647
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:23,700
there's a lot more well yeah then a

648
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:27,000
little later came the res cut yep you

649
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,580
know because uh uh chem dog gave res a

650
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,619
cut of Sour Diesel and he started making

651
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:34,019
seeds with it you know and stuff like

652
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:36,298
that and so there was probably a number

653
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:38,819
of cuts that came from res seeds that

654
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:41,038
got repurposed yeah because everybody

655
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:43,079
just wanted to call like to the Brokers

656
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,579
or whatever it was Sour Diesel they

657
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,599
didn't really want to explain its origin

658
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:50,579
yeah so it got super confusing

659
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,319
um and it's almost a little bit like the

660
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:54,538
what happened with Haze

661
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,759
yeah where like in New York there's like

662
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:58,500
you know I'm in Florida there's like you

663
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,940
know 15 different 20 different Haze

664
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,980
names

665
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,019
that only a tiny percentage of people

666
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,519
really know where they originated from

667
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:07,740
yeah and then there's things that are

668
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,139
called you know that that are are named

669
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,700
that in recent ones it's like

670
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,700
um you know now there's like there's a

671
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,798
JP cut there's a skunk that cut some

672
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,860
people attach my name to a cut there's

673
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:23,700
an a cut the hunter mountain cut the cat

674
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:26,939
skills cut the one helpfully called the

675
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:30,179
real Sour Diesel yeah uh as if that

676
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,240
clears it all up you know the Manny cut

677
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,880
the AJ cut we left out AJ AJ's had his

678
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,558
name attached probably first yeah yeah

679
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,840
yeah yes

680
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,298
you know I mean There Was You know the

681
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,119
AJ cut uh and the AJ cut has probably

682
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:47,460
had like several Cuts yeah have been

683
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,038
called the AJ it's kind of like ghost OG

684
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,679
and that like what's the original AJ

685
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,599
isn't the current AJ yeah yeah the

686
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,700
original ghost isn't even the same ghost

687
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,759
from the forums it's [ __ ] weird how

688
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,319
that works yeah you know things so I

689
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,579
mean it's well it is weird how it works

690
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,599
but then we're talking about something

691
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:09,960
that was sprouted in 96 and it's 20 22.

692
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,899
yeah and so it's gone through like 26

693
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,919
years of clandestine shifting around

694
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,778
right

695
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,820
and it also was one of the most popular

696
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:20,038
Cuts in America for probably 10 years

697
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,980
yeah

698
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,079
at least I mean it goes through phases

699
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,900
you know like it's been the most popular

700
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,278
cut in America a few times for for long

701
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,320
spans of time

702
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,298
yeah I mean I think I think the only

703
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,859
reason why I said for 10 years is

704
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,759
probably because it probably took until

705
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,000
about

706
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,859
2005 2006.

707
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,298
for enough people to get a hold of it

708
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,918
that there was just so much of it that

709
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:46,200
it could become probably like the most

710
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,759
popular kind bud yeah because even

711
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,500
though it was popular before it's like

712
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,259
you can only get so popular if only so

713
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,778
many people are growing it yep so it did

714
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:56,640
take some time to spread and I think it

715
00:27:54,778 --> 00:28:00,179
remained popular right up until probably

716
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,538
like this last wave of candy kitty

717
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,840
purpleweed yeah that took over and

718
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:08,278
everything had to be you know

719
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,798
yeah some kind of gelato or cookie

720
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:12,359
hybrid of some kite some it had to have

721
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,099
a specific look there was a lot of

722
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,619
variations on the theme and for the

723
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:19,558
first time in about 20 years kind of gas

724
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:21,778
fell off for a minute yeah you started

725
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,298
hearing if it's not purple it won't move

726
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:26,819
yeah you stop seeing a lot of the sour

727
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:29,099
beginnings of the names and stuff added

728
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:31,558
to different strand names yeah and now

729
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:33,538
and what's funny about that is then sour

730
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:35,879
had like a moment for two or three four

731
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:37,740
years where it wasn't very popular and

732
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,600
now it's had a resurgence

733
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,278
yeah which is really weird because then

734
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,980
you have a situation now where there's

735
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,079
like 15 or 18 different names and

736
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,360
everyone has the everyone has the

737
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:52,259
special rarest oldest bestest

738
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:55,798
yeah strongest mostest yeah the bestest

739
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:57,240
the grandmasest all of it yeah all of it

740
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:59,339
you know and there's a lot of certainty

741
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,200
in an uncertain World in that regard in

742
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:02,158
my opinion luckily most of them are

743
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,298
pretty good

744
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,159
yeah

745
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:06,778
you know in all honesty it's like

746
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,960
there's there's only there's only really

747
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:11,519
been one that I thought sucked terribly

748
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,120
which one was that

749
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:20,639
was the Joe B diesel oh yeah yeah the

750
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:22,918
the Kim 91 JB yeah I mean yeah the the I

751
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,020
don't know what I you know there's a

752
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,940
thing I I've told this story before but

753
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:28,918
uh there's a thing where I just had this

754
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,659
one Sour Diesel cut for a long time and

755
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,380
I never traded with anyone because I had

756
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,360
it

757
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,880
yeah and then people started asking me

758
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,219
which version I had and I had no idea I

759
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,380
still have no idea yeah so occasionally

760
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,360
I collect half a dozen of them or so and

761
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,399
I grow them all next to mine in the same

762
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,859
room at the same time in the same

763
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:50,398
environment to see like which which you

764
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:52,859
know what are the differences yeah right

765
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,719
um and you know there's there's a good

766
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,579
amount of cuts out there and their

767
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,980
Origins are mysterious

768
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:01,019
you know so I don't know what mine is I

769
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,339
still I kept at first I was like oh I'm

770
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:03,538
just gonna get this half a dozen or

771
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,459
whatever and I'm gonna grow them and

772
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:08,519
then whatever one mine is that's that's

773
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,659
what everyone calls it yeah only that

774
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:11,339
didn't happen

775
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,380
let me see here I'm gonna put up a

776
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:15,538
picture just so people can see what

777
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,539
we're talking about here

778
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:21,419
um where's the sours I think that's it

779
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:23,819
it's gonna be in this one and is it here

780
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,840
is that it no no no that's a Choco here

781
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:26,839
we go there we go

782
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,278

show up yeah I can see it yep yeah and

784
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:36,119
that just so people know I think Matt

785
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,620
can see comments the format I've got

786
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,319
right now it's like hard for me to read

787
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:41,879
at the same time so I apologize if I'm

788
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,058
missing stuff or if you see anything

789
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,100
super pertinent Matt just uh speak up

790
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:50,158
now it's just a black screen

791
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,119
huh is it back up it's back up there we

792
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,440
go okay

793
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,639
I don't know it's probably like four

794
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,380
weeks in uh there's a nug of it um that

795
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,120
looks so much like Choco's like it is

796
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,360
like at least this this this this

797
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:05,099
particular you know budget piece yeah I

798
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,918
mean yeah I got that we got we got that

799
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,359
cut around two thousand and we've never

800
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,580
lost it

801
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,259
and that's what I consider Sour Diesel

802
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:16,139
and if if you if you pause it for a

803
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:18,839
second you know when people were when we

804
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:21,720
when you showed those pictures of uh the

805
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,278
dog uh the chem dog earlier and I had

806
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,620
you pause at that other one where you

807
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:28,380
could see like the leaf rust and death

808
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,538
yeah the weird necrosis and stuff if you

809
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,820
look at that Sour Diesel right there you

810
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:36,960
can see that same kind of

811
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:39,359
of issue yeah right so the very huh yeah

812
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,919
go ahead so the very first sour I got

813
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,379
there's a lot of people that have sours

814
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,960
that variegate

815
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,940
mine doesn't variegate it does that yeah

816
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,919
whatever you whatever whatever technical

817
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,179
term you'd call that

818
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,500
it

819
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,298
um so that's not really like somebody

820
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,759
messing up on the nutrient or whatever

821
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:58,740
like the dog it does the thing where it

822
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,019
starts to eat its leaves about halfway

823
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,460
through sometimes and there's not a

824
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,038
whole hell of a lot you can do about it

825
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,840
yeah um sometimes it's more pronounced

826
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,298
than others but it almost always happens

827
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,220
and that one right there it never

828
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:12,960
variegates ever

829
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,579
it just does that

830
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,038
you know I was going to show this real

831
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:19,319
quick this is a pandas cut that keeps

832
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,259
being passed around his math super of

833
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:24,778
the jesel sour dub it also has that same

834
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:26,460
trait it also has that's yeah it has a

835
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:29,159
very similar trait in that regard so

836
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,240
that's and but then like my La cut my

837
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,220
headband

838
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,038
um you know and then other sours I see

839
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:38,579
people have have like more of that chemd

840
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:42,298
patterning variegation yeah that doesn't

841
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:45,058
do the the leaf rust Leaf death necrosis

842
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:47,940
type yellowing it has a it has its own

843
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:49,678
distinct thing that it does yeah

844
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,240
you know and I'm not saying mine's the

845
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,320
first I like you know I don't know I

846
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,240
don't know what hap I don't know what

847
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,398
mine is before I got it

848
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,058
but I can say I've had it

849
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,879
um since then and not lost it yeah right

850
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:04,980
um and it throws bats and you know more

851
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,899
importantly than that it's it's got like

852
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,278
just because it's the first one it's got

853
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:11,699
what I consider to have like the

854
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,140
distinct Sour Notes yeah you know and

855
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,000
can we talk about that a little bit

856
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,440
because like that's something that a lot

857
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,940
of people even to this day like I'll

858
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,100
hear oh it's got the sour nose you know

859
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,440
it's sour like like lemons you know I'll

860
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:25,319
get that a lot like it's sour like you

861
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,259
know uh like sour you know but when I

862
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,939
think of sour I think rubber skunky you

863
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,440
know with sour to you

864
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,179
so

865
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,798
um what I will say is like the diesel

866
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:41,159
family right uh that particular one uh

867
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:43,679
it smells it has I would say it has gas

868
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:46,440
but the gas is almost on the back end

869
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,538
right where a lot of diesels it's it's

870
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,058
on the Forefront it's like the fumes of

871
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:53,579
the first thing that hits your nose yeah

872
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:56,038
um that one has gas but it also has this

873
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:58,678
weird nose crinkle

874
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:00,240
uh in the sense that you know sometimes

875
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,038
you smell things that like should be

876
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,140
gross but it's weed so it smells

877
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,599
delicious somehow yeah

878
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:10,378
it's got kind of that it's got like a

879
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:13,079
nose crinkle gas that's a little bit

880
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:16,139
sour that's a little bit off yeah right

881
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,059
uh that's my perception of it at least

882
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,000
um and it tastes really much it the the

883
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:23,699
flavor carries over pretty strongly yes

884
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,219
that's a big big trait of sour I would

885
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:28,079
say uh you know the general yeah the

886
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,059
flavor itself of what you get on the

887
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:34,619
nose is what you get on the palette

888
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:36,898
right where I think uh a lot of

889
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:39,358
um a lot of the more modern stuff as far

890
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:43,500
as diesels and and sours go which I

891
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:46,559
still love a lot like the fuel knows the

892
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,838
gas nose is like very prevalent it's

893
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,940
like the it's like on the forward so

894
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:52,619
that right there

895
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,940
um though although I didn't tell you

896
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:55,619
that man when we were setting some of

897
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,079
these up but all those East Coast Sour

898
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,660
Diesel picks that I sent you yeah right

899
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,338
here these are all from the homie pip

900
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:04,139
yeah

901
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:06,239
um there I mean he didn't grow it but he

902
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:09,179
he's who gave me that version of East

903
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,279
Coast Sour Diesel yep and so I ran this

904
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:13,739
one next to the choco and they're

905
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,440
identical and so if you see that one

906
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:19,559
hold on go back one

907
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,960
if you see that one there it's got a to

908
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:24,119
me like that's a nice Cola it's got a

909
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,059
very delicate feathery

910
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,160
you know skunk kind of like overlaying

911
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,559
calyx's kind of approach right a little

912
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:34,019
bit of foxtailing going on

913
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:36,539
um where like if if that the actual sour

914
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:39,780
that I have was much more of a chunk

915
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:41,519
yeah right there was my chunky Bud it

916
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,099
was it was very chunky there was more

917
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,079
side buds to it that East Coast Sour

918
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,980
Diesel would throw bats but they were

919
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,720
delicate feathery looser bats I want to

920
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,099
say something real quick and for people

921
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,439
who don't aren't familiar with

922
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:58,019
greenhouse and outdoor and and that's

923
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,900
kind of like me I didn't do a lot of it

924
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:03,960
um so when you're looking at plants it's

925
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,119
they look very different indoor to

926
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,320
Greenhouse to outdoor so if you're

927
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,820
looking at this and thinking ah that

928
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,220
doesn't look anything like my my East

929
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,079
Coast allergies or my ecsd cut I don't

930
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:14,699
know a lot of it's going to have to do

931
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,740
with the morphology from it going to

932
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:18,000
indoor to outdoor greenhouse and all

933
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,979
that so I just wanted to make that clear

934
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,079
for people because a lot of people try

935
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,059
to you know make those associations by

936
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,280
looking at pictures of cuts and saying

937
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,920
this is this the same cut you know and

938
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,800
that's a major jump going outdoor to to

939
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,659
indoors so I do think and that's a good

940
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,940
point and maybe we could segue into that

941
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:38,578
for just a second sure which is there

942
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,280
are some strains that are very easy to

943
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:42,960
identify visually because they tend to

944
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,240
perform in different environments

945
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,159
whether it's indoor outdoor Greenhouse

946
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,519
they tend to perform similarly enough

947
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:54,299
that they're easy to identify the diesel

948
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:56,039
family in general is not that way uh it

949
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,140
can come out very different even in

950
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,239
people's indoors it's very sensitive to

951
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:02,338
light it's very sensitive to food and

952
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:03,019
and whether it's organic or salts or

953
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:06,059
whatever

954
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:07,739
and so to me the only real way to test

955
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:10,199
diesel really well

956
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:11,759
is to grow it side by side to itself in

957
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:14,279
the same environment at the same time

958
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,079
yeah so you can't see it in this

959
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,359
greenhouse right yet but in that

960
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,099
Greenhouse I had about seven types of

961
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:23,519
diesels all growing next to each other

962
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:25,859
same food same size pots same light

963
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:29,280
obviously it was the sun I've done the

964
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:30,598
same thing inside you know and so

965
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,760
um that's really where you get to see

966
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,859
the nuances yeah

967
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,960
um I am not good at and I don't think

968
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:38,639
anyone is really that good at looking at

969
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,039
Diesels or certain strains like that

970
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,618
online and being like looking at this

971
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:47,039
pick and being like Oh Yeah that's it

972
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:49,740
when it's being grown knf and under an

973
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,440
LED in somebody's environment that's not

974
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,899
yours and you don't grow it like that so

975
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,820
I think that you know I I really do

976
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:01,680
believe that you kind of have to like

977
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,838
compare same to same yeah I agree

978
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,460
um this right here I was I didn't load

979
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,639
up a picture of indoor sour for whatever

980
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,619
reason the ecsd but I did keep a picture

981
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,460
of Super Skunk candy which has a very

982
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:17,039
similar uh morphology mud structure to

983
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,980
What Sour looks indoor it's very similar

984
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:22,079
to the dcsd cut specifically I mean I'll

985
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,760
say you know I'll say that when I grow

986
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:29,880
diesel I see I see super skunk and I see

987
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,579
chem dog in it yeah I can't guarantee

988
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:36,059
it's the only thing in it but I I see

989
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:38,940
traits that pass down from both parents

990
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:41,699
yeah you know easily and I've known a

991
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,500
lot of all of them so you know it uh

992
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:46,139
take that and I also think that like

993
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:49,320
sour for everyone listening diesels in

994
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:54,358
general is our modern skunk

995
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:57,180
yeah I you know I I agree that sour you

996
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:59,819
know I think that fuel and gas and that

997
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:02,338
nose crinkle and all that weird I I

998
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:07,019
think that's all offshoots of like that

999
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:10,139
rank RFK like all that skunk stink yeah

1000
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:11,820
I think it's just all plays on the same

1001
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,039
nose

1002
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,400
I put up pictures of chem 91 again so

1003
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:19,920
people can get another idea for uh look

1004
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,079
at you but if you go go back to one more

1005
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,559
that one you you can see it on that one

1006
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,900
and you had another one in there uh oh

1007
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,599
one more back there you go that one you

1008
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,519
can see that one you can see when I was

1009
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,039
showing my picture of Sour Diesel and he

1010
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,559
was showing that sour dub yeah right

1011
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:41,159
that uh so that's three different cuts

1012
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:43,380
you can see that same weird Leaf curl

1013
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,259
Browning Leaf death

1014
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,838
the whole bit yeah that's a trait that

1015
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,119
passes in my opinion and another trait

1016
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:53,039
that I see in super skunk a lot and and

1017
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,720
I only ever see it in Super Skunk are

1018
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,759
these little what we call them dog

1019
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,858
tongues please and they're little

1020
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,560
slightly rounded not very resinous

1021
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:03,598
leaves and they're all over the the buds

1022
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:05,880
in little tiny small parts and usually

1023
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,820
uh any super skunk types whether it be

1024
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,800
chem 91 in my opinion

1025
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,099
um any of them sour usually you'll see

1026
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,660
those little things and uh it's it's a

1027
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,460
trait that runs through super skunk and

1028
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:19,858
it's usually easily to tell Super Skunk

1029
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,960
because of that trait

1030
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:24,119
it's one of those identifying visual

1031
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,559
traits

1032
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:30,780
so you know I mean I guess there's um

1033
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,699
so there's probably like a

1034
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,440
there was the first wave of sour that

1035
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:36,659
got passed around a bunch

1036
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,519
and those were just labeled Sour Diesel

1037
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:40,199
and they had basically no other monikers

1038
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,880
yeah and then there was probably

1039
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:44,519
something from I don't know would you

1040
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,980
say like the mid-2000s on

1041
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,719
where there was a whole batch that

1042
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,519
started getting named on the internet

1043
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,500
yeah

1044
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,838
right yep

1045
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,639
and then it fell out of popularity for a

1046
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:58,320
minute and now there's another whole

1047
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,900
batch that has gotten named on the

1048
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,400
internet and again it's like I know you

1049
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,220
know J plant speaker has asked people

1050
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,539
not to not to name it after him because

1051
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:09,679
it's not his

1052
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:12,239
but what happens is you tend to name it

1053
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,098
by the source that other people would

1054
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,879
know it you need some kind of descriptor

1055
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:21,780
yeah so it ends up being not so sour

1056
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:27,300
or JP sour or skunk Tech sour or this

1057
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:30,119
sour or you know yeah or whatever

1058
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,859
um and uh you know

1059
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,320
I don't know that you know I would have

1060
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:36,900
to go get probably gather up another

1061
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,900
half a dozen sours and grow them against

1062
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,019
the ones that I know yeah because at one

1063
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,440
point I think I had like nine or ten

1064
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:47,699
that's a lot of them

1065
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,200
I didn't keep all of them but I was

1066
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:51,719
trying to collect them to see what the

1067
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,879
hell was going on yeah

1068
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,699
because for a long time I thought there

1069
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,660
was just a couple of cuts

1070
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:02,939
and then I realized there was a ton yeah

1071
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:05,460
keep going my headphone broke real quick

1072
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,880
your headphone broke yeah I gotta switch

1073
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,639
headphones keep going so yeah I mean I

1074
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,140
uh I um

1075
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:14,578
all the people are talking in the

1076
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:18,000
comments I'm gonna look at

1077
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:20,039
you know the uh uh the thing about it

1078
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,019
someone just asked something and I wish

1079
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:23,400
I'd cry baby on right now to explain it

1080
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:26,579
but somebody was asking what are the

1081
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:30,059
main terpenes of of sour

1082
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:32,220
and I don't think that terpenes uh tell

1083
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,139
the whole story

1084
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:36,838
um there's these volatile compounds I

1085
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:39,179
hope I don't I don't uh mangle the word

1086
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:42,358
but he would call it theols

1087
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:44,338
files there's there's a number of

1088
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,799
different scent compounds and I think

1089
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:48,960
Sour Diesel and skunks in general have a

1090
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,039
relatively complicated chain of those

1091
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,679
yeah so it's a combination of terpenes

1092
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:57,599
and you know uh volatile gases and other

1093
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,919
types of things that combine to make

1094
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,019
that aroma

1095
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,119
yep right

1096
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:06,358
um and uh so I think they're called so

1097
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,519
far uh uh something sulfur compounds uh

1098
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:11,578
it's on tip my tongue volatile sulfur

1099
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,139
compounds BSC balls yeah so yeah because

1100
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,760
you know the even with like the super

1101
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:16,259
skunk that he's got posted up there

1102
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,020
right now

1103
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,000
um it smelled unbelievable the last two

1104
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:24,838
weeks of flower and the first three or

1105
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,818
four weeks of uh post-harvest and then

1106
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:28,799
it faded and it didn't store that well

1107
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:32,039
and it became kind of generic greenweed

1108
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,019
yep so those terpenes were not long

1109
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:36,900
lasting that was not the kind of weed

1110
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:40,440
the super skunk itself that you would

1111
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,838
want to store and let chill for a month

1112
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,460
for best effect yeah that was the kind

1113
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:46,318
of weed where like as soon as it was

1114
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,139
smokable you wanted to start ripping it

1115
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:51,179
yeah because it was gonna fade

1116
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:52,920
where the chem dog was the reverse it

1117
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:55,618
took almost a month for it to really

1118
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,480
come into its own yeah and I think the

1119
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:59,280
sour is a blend of the two the sour

1120
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,980
tastes great right away and it also

1121
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,260
holds it for a while

1122
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,000
you know so

1123
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,700
it holds it pretty well some of the

1124
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,818
super skunks do not hold that skunkiness

1125
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:14,279
super well past drying no I it's it

1126
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:16,619
doesn't last long Super Skunk is best

1127
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,980
fresh and becomes generic pretty fast

1128
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:21,960
yeah yeah that's the hard part about it

1129
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,059
it doesn't store well

1130
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,099
you know it doesn't it it does not store

1131
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:27,358
well no I wonder if that you know like

1132
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,099
we always hear about people like

1133
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,598
stopping growing skunky stuff because

1134
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,818
like they didn't want to get popped or

1135
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,859
whatever I wonder if that another aspect

1136
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:37,199
would have been not storing well like

1137
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:39,960
that is a major important part of you

1138
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,159
know artists well yeah it didn't store

1139
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,800
that well

1140
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:46,139
um and it was only moderate potency yeah

1141
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,720
that was the other component it's a

1142
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:52,440
classic example of a strain that does a

1143
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:55,139
couple of things really really well yeah

1144
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,940
um but isn't is incomplete

1145
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:59,639
I mean that was the whole point of this

1146
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:03,119
of the Superdog project really yeah was

1147
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:06,000
to sort of take the lime green color

1148
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,099
from the super skunk and its flavor and

1149
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,780
some of its visible Crystal formation

1150
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:12,960
right

1151
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,720
and add that to the frame of the chem

1152
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,858
dog which was denser and much more

1153
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:21,779
potent and longer lasting yeah so you

1154
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:24,000
were trying to see can we get can we get

1155
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,460
the good parts of both into each

1156
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,460
yeah you know uh this what's weird

1157
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,960
though is that if you made if you made

1158
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,260
dry sift

1159
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,240
um not water hash but if you made dry I

1160
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,839
actually think some of the stuff was

1161
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:42,419
water soluble but if you made dry sift

1162
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,759
with the super skunk and you Jarred that

1163
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,159
and treated it nice the the pro the

1164
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,300
smell profile would stay for a long long

1165
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:52,980
time in Kief yeah but in weed it would

1166
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,660
oxidize and go away

1167
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,179
that's weird

1168
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:58,799
you know like

1169
00:45:56,179 --> 00:46:01,500
for all of the legendary [ __ ] people

1170
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,000
talk about Super Skunk like six weeks

1171
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,699
after you cut it down that [ __ ] was

1172
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,559
generic greenweed yeah it didn't get you

1173
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:09,838
that high

1174
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,719
and I say that as like a big fan of it

1175
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:15,059
you know yeah like it's it wasn't

1176
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:16,980
something that like you were like oh you

1177
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:18,539
know man two months from now this is

1178
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,599
gonna be the fire

1179
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:23,460
no you [ __ ] ripped it as soon as it

1180
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,680
was dry enough to smoke you started

1181
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,599
puffing it yeah and it would almost you

1182
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,239
would almost ruin the dog if you smoked

1183
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,880
it too soon it really benefited it was

1184
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,799
denser and it took longer to cure its

1185
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,358
flavor and its Buzz really benefited by

1186
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,980
you kind of leaving it alone for a few

1187
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:41,460
weeks

1188
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:43,079
so they bonded well together because you

1189
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,818
could smoke the [ __ ] out of Super Skunk

1190
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,740
for a few weeks and then finally start

1191
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:49,259
hitting your dog and then there would be

1192
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:51,539
a time period where both were good and

1193
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,099
then the super skunk would be bunk and

1194
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:55,679
the dog would still be good and then

1195
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:56,940
you'd Harvest again interesting and they

1196
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,440
essentially might have been two

1197
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,039
different types of Super Skunk but just

1198
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,358
because they were two different

1199
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:01,380
Expressions you could bounce between

1200
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:03,900
them

1201
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,358
yeah I mean I just I and it's what's

1202
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,579
interesting too is that you know we joke

1203
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:10,980
around about how like

1204
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:13,079
um you know the most famous thing that

1205
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,019
uh Sam's man ever did was breed the

1206
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:18,599
skunk out of uh out of out of the skunk

1207
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:21,659
yeah right yeah but

1208
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,940
his point of view was that the skunky

1209
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:25,078
[ __ ] didn't have the high he liked

1210
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,599
okay

1211
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:30,480
and so he bred away from it

1212
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,818
it had a a muddled not that great a high

1213
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,338
and the stuff that we all don't like as

1214
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:37,440
much like the the Citrus and the floral

1215
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:39,719
and all that that had the more up Buzz

1216
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,400
that he enjoyed yeah

1217
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,439
I'll believe it when he comes on the

1218
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,838
shows and uh tells it to me I don't

1219
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,760
really believe that story yeah I'd like

1220
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,500
to hear it from him personally that's

1221
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,240
the uh that's the thing about all the

1222
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,239
old timers right is that there's like

1223
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:57,358
very little there's it's it's all their

1224
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:59,459
their remembrances yeah

1225
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:02,279
you know there is someone though that

1226
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:05,460
grew um a lot of night or a lot of skunk

1227
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:08,339
one from uh Robin Sam in 1978 three are

1228
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,920
gonna be interviewing soon and uh yeah

1229
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:13,500
he actually has a he has a documentation

1230
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,440
all of the pictures you can imagine was

1231
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,480
even in High Times selling you know in

1232
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,300
the thmq showing that he was growing it

1233
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,519
selling it it was moving and uh he has

1234
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,500
very good memories of it uh very

1235
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,119
accurate he's really quick with it so

1236
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,219
I'm looking forward to that he might

1237
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,800
actually prove me wrong you know that

1238
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,118
that would be dope Yeah the more the

1239
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,119
more opinions you get to it I mean

1240
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,280
that's kind of the getting back to sour

1241
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:42,059
um that's kind of the Crux of like

1242
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:43,800
people having one sour story is there's

1243
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:46,078
probably like half a dozen people

1244
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,359
loosely associated with the creation of

1245
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,339
sour in one form or another right yeah

1246
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:53,400
and two or three that are pretty Central

1247
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:56,279
to it and they all don't agree on

1248
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,858
exactly how it all went down yeah even

1249
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,200
amongst themselves and publicly

1250
00:48:58,858 --> 00:49:03,539
so you know a certain point it's like

1251
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:07,379
who do you trust yeah who do you talk to

1252
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:10,500
it's hard it's hard

1253
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,960
um yeah it is hard it is hard especially

1254
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:16,440
because a lot of times and you know and

1255
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,639
Matt and I deal with this all the time

1256
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,679
um but a lot of times when you interview

1257
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:21,179
people

1258
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:24,539
their first goal is in historical

1259
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:27,179
honesty yeah it's making themselves look

1260
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:29,159
good yeah I mean that's kind of part of

1261
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:31,199
Being Human yeah telling telling the

1262
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:34,318
history in a way that suits them you

1263
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:36,659
know so the more angles you can get on

1264
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,699
the same subject at times

1265
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:40,019
uh it can be better

1266
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:41,879
but

1267
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,559
um this is a picture from Rascal and the

1268
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,420
reason I chose this picture was because

1269
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,880
back in the day it was so hard to find

1270
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:49,380
any good pictures of diesel but also

1271
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,519
realistic pictures because there were a

1272
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,180
lot of people growing stuff that wasn't

1273
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:57,719
it his show the it's in my opinion how

1274
00:49:54,179 --> 00:50:00,059
it looks the best low resin production

1275
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,799
um his wasn't his foxtaily but I mean it

1276
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:03,779
gets pretty heavily fox tail and looks a

1277
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,760
lot like super skunk in that old Scentsy

1278
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,560
picture but for people to be able to to

1279
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,440
see what diesel is it was again in my

1280
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:13,380
opinion this is a uh uh Super Skunk S1

1281
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,780
not a super skunk chem dog D hyper like

1282
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,220
the candle Bible set but you see all

1283
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,140
these wonderful expressions of Super

1284
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:21,299
Skunk even little dog tongues in the in

1285
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:24,179
the diesel

1286
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,859
I was hoping that some of this genetic

1287
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:28,500
testing that came out was going to start

1288
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:32,159
revealing some of these connections and

1289
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:34,500
lineages uh so we would have uh data

1290
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,019
sets to go with the oral histories and

1291
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,838
the stories yeah but so far that's been

1292
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:41,940
Elusive and hasn't really happened

1293
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,500
um so we're stuck with the stories but I

1294
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,380
will say that

1295
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,960
um this is just one guy's opinion but uh

1296
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:51,660
diesel is probably up there with like my

1297
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,940
all-time favorite family of weed you

1298
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:55,739
know it's up there to me with Haze or

1299
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,960
something along those lines in terms of

1300
00:50:55,739 --> 00:51:01,019
like it's definitely like you know take

1301
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,480
it to the island type of Bud yeah um and

1302
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:04,739
most of them are pretty nice I grew when

1303
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,159
I realized that there was a bunch of

1304
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:12,358
sours out there I took my sour the ecsd

1305
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:15,420
from pip uh an NYC diesel uh the Joe B

1306
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,098
the Amish clarify the NYC diesel

1307
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,838
clarified that for people clarify the

1308
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:20,880
NYC diesel for people that it was not

1309
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:23,460
the Soma one it's definitely not the

1310
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,660
Soma one no it wasn't even related it

1311
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,940
was from

1312
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:28,739
it was for bald eagle yeah yeah it was

1313
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,139
from bald eagle and then

1314
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:33,179
um and then I got a couple others and I

1315
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:35,699
grew them all side by side indoors and

1316
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:39,000
in a greenhouse uh two or three times in

1317
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:41,939
a row yeah right and it was interesting

1318
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,559
because they when you're growing like

1319
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,300
the same family like that and you're

1320
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,040
seeing sisters to each other or half

1321
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,539
says whatever they might be related to

1322
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,300
each other they're definitely all from

1323
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:53,940
the same family yeah so some of them had

1324
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:57,480
Dart had very dark green leaves

1325
00:51:53,940 --> 00:52:00,059
some of them had very light green leaves

1326
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,300
um the yeah the some of them smelled

1327
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:04,800
like the the choco uh I grew the choco

1328
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,119
and the East Coast Sour Diesel from Pep

1329
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,460
they were basically I think the same

1330
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,140
yeah um and they have like to me what I

1331
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,199
consider to be more like an LA or like a

1332
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:16,500
headband smell oh interesting right yeah

1333
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:20,039
um but the New York City Diesel from uh

1334
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:23,099
bald eagle was like pure fuel yeah like

1335
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:25,619
dipped in gasoline and then you smelled

1336
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:28,500
it no other notes of anything just like

1337
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:30,420
pure nose crinkling fuel some of them

1338
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,880
had skunks some of them had a mix of

1339
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:35,940
skunk and headband that one was fuel the

1340
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,318
Amish was pretty nice but compared out

1341
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,980
of all of them out of all that first

1342
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:43,980
batch I think the the ecsd that pip gave

1343
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,780
that supposedly half of Death Star uh

1344
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,240
that particular cut the choco or

1345
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,640
whatever was my favorite of the ones

1346
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,078
that weren't mine yeah but they were all

1347
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,699
different and other than the East Coast

1348
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,140
Sour Diesel and the choco none of them

1349
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:58,139
were the same

1350
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:59,639
interesting and then I grew them again I

1351
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:02,338
think the second year

1352
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,858
and that year I remember at it was the

1353
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:07,380
second can Illuminati party we had yeah

1354
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:09,420
and I remember yeah I brought four or

1355
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,700
five different types of those that year

1356
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,559
you know yeah I remember the Amish real

1357
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:16,799
well because that was my favorite for

1358
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,420
flavor anyways yeah actually that year I

1359
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,579
didn't actually bring any of my own sour

1360
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,900
for some reason like it didn't end up in

1361
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,160
the it didn't end up in the comparison

1362
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,079
but

1363
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:26,639
um I was growing all the numerals yeah

1364
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,619
and seeing how they performed and some

1365
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:31,199
of them were shorter and fatter and and

1366
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:34,920
yielded you know a little nicer some of

1367
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:36,719
them were taller and more feathery

1368
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,639
um you know and their formation and

1369
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:41,818
stuff and so but they were all

1370
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:44,279
variations on the same theme

1371
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:47,579
if that makes any sense no yeah totally

1372
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:50,339
you know they were all they you know but

1373
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:52,800
I did find it interesting like uh my

1374
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:56,099
headband has kind of my La has kind of

1375
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,900
lighter leaves the nycd from bald eagle

1376
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:00,420
and another one both had very pale

1377
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,980
leaves like that interesting where there

1378
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,800
was a couple like all these different

1379
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,199
expressions of similar stuff coming out

1380
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,420
of the same lines but then there was one

1381
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:12,719
that but then there was another one that

1382
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:16,440
that uh mine and the dog and one other

1383
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:19,858
diesel had very dark dark leaves yeah

1384
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,139
like Olive colored not lime at all

1385
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:25,318
and some of them stayed pure green all

1386
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:27,239
the way through some of them variegated

1387
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:29,039
and some of them did that weird Leaf

1388
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:31,078
death thing like I was talking about it

1389
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,019
makes sense all those different traits

1390
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:36,839
from uh you know super skunks you know

1391
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:38,159
so that was interesting too and so you

1392
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:40,500
know I don't know I mean people get all

1393
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:42,779
uptight about like everyone's everyone's

1394
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,880
sour now like it goes back to the mid

1395
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,460
90s it's the original it's the best one

1396
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,900
it's the this people are attaching their

1397
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,400
name to it and trying to sell them for

1398
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,200
high dollar

1399
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,740
um the good thing for me at least is

1400
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:58,259
that despite all that chaos yeah

1401
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:01,739
um it's better weed generally than

1402
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:04,200
what's been popular lately yeah right so

1403
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:06,179
it's only huh yeah I agree

1404
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,519
so it's only an improvement

1405
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:10,440
you know over all these other purples

1406
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:11,579
and all these different things that have

1407
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,559
been running nothing I'm against purple

1408
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:18,180
by any means but just like the the

1409
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:21,119
purple only era you know yeah

1410
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:22,940
um it's is uh choco is not chocolate

1411
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,680
diesel somebody just commented that

1412
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:29,579
chocolate diesel is different choco is a

1413
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,739
dude from the forums that got a cut of

1414
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:34,740
Sour Diesel named after of him because

1415
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:38,279
of how he traded it I believe

1416
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:39,899
was that accurate though no he got it he

1417
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,400
got named after him because it was the

1418
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,740

Sour Diesel named after him yeah

1427
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:07,500
it's kind of is kind of the movie yeah I

1428
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:08,358
saw someone said that Amish is a cross

1429
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,239
of

1430
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:15,539
sour and head banger that that come on

1431
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:17,039
guys come on I mean there's a lot of

1432
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:19,019
different stories about these different

1433
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,980
I mean but that one Headbangers like

1434
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:25,739
five years old Amish yes no the Amish I

1435
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:28,920
will I will I'll agree with Matt on

1436
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:33,419
there 100 yeah the name Amish from

1437
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:36,059
shroomy Far Far precedes any headbanger

1438
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:39,300
existence yeah it's a little bit off on

1439
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:41,819
the years which is why I was giggling

1440
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,579
you know and so

1441
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:46,739
um yeah they they uh there's a there's a

1442
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:48,599
whole bit of it where it's cool that

1443
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:50,818
there's all this like renewed interest

1444
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:52,200
in trying to figure it all out

1445
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:53,599
yeah right

1446
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:57,838
um and one of the things that's made

1447
00:56:53,599 --> 00:57:01,318
diesel cuts a lot more popular uh I

1448
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:03,779
think and is because because that strain

1449
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:06,179
became so popular for so long it's

1450
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:08,280
almost like the nl5 hazes where there's

1451
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:11,219
just more phenos of it than almost any

1452
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,800
other type out there yeah there's not

1453
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:15,659
like I mean I think you know gelato and

1454
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,079
cookie has a bunch of Finos obviously

1455
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:21,000
right but sour and sour is up there is

1456
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:22,740
like there's a bunch of them

1457
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,318
yeah you know and so it's pretty

1458
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:26,338
widespread people have access to it I

1459
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:28,558
think

1460
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:31,199
and that helps something gain popularity

1461
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,300
yeah definitely and then people want to

1462
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,739
figure out oh well which one is it which

1463
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,420
one is this which one is that because

1464
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:38,399
everybody wants the original real one

1465
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,900
just in the sense that they think that

1466
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,000
that one has to be better than all the

1467
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,338
ones that came after it but yeah it's

1468
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,679
the original that's it starts out the

1469
00:57:44,338 --> 00:57:48,358
best and it just loses as it goes down

1470
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:50,759
isn't that how breeding works it's just

1471
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:53,639
you know sometimes but sometimes things

1472
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,099
get better too you know so

1473
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,679
um I I just wanted to this is uh another

1474
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:00,420
Super Skunk cross this is my um blooper

1475
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,219
skunk which is the diesel Blue Bonnet

1476
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,680
but I just wanted to show this because

1477
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:06,779
you can see a lot of the the sour traits

1478
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:09,598
coming through very heavy in it very

1479
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,760
obviously it breeds very dominant or the

1480
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,318
super scum crates I should say uh which

1481
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,359
you can see in sour and all the other

1482
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:18,239
Super Skunk types

1483
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,858
um yeah it you can go down grandchildren

1484
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,659
great grandchildren when it comes to

1485
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:23,759
Super Skunk and if someone's selecting

1486
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:25,318
towards those traits you will still be

1487
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,200
seeing those traits and often you'll be

1488
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:30,058
seeing those same uh scent profiles and

1489
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:32,578
whatnot

1490
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:34,980
yeah we uh somebody was asking which

1491
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:36,720
there's some spammers in our comments oh

1492
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,818
yeah cool

1493
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:41,459
um someone was asking which one has the

1494
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:43,980
dark one uh the dark leaves uh the cut

1495
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,838
that I have has dark leaves

1496
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:48,539
um there's a depends on how much you

1497
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:51,058
feed it nitrogen too and also yes and

1498
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:53,880
the light source so that can that can be

1499
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:55,500
like I said before visually they can be

1500
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,140
very hard to tell apart in different

1501
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,000
people's rooms yeah because they are

1502
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:01,440
very environmentally and Spectrum

1503
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,780
sensitive

1504
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,700
so they perform very differently

1505
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,380
depending on where they're at and how

1506
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:08,879
they're fed

1507
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,260
um and you know it's interesting like

1508
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,480
when

1509
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,640
um you know when Pip was at that party

1510
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,960
and he smoked that ecsd he was like dude

1511
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,719
that's some of the best I've ever seen

1512
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,159
it grown right and it wasn't so much a

1513
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:21,598
testament to Me Knocking it out of the

1514
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,179
park or anything like that it's more of

1515
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,760
a testament to like sours can be really

1516
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:29,578
hard to nail yes they can you can make

1517
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,140
sour super boofy super fast you know you

1518
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:32,640
grow sour and you knock it out of the

1519
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:34,199
park and you're so stoked in the next

1520
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:35,400
three or four times you grow it it's not

1521
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:38,759
nearly as good but you didn't change

1522
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,139
much yeah and so you don't know why so

1523
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,059
when you really knock it out of the park

1524
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:43,858
and you get its full potential it's full

1525
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:45,180
Buzz it's full nose everything you're

1526
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:47,460
just like oh my God this is some of the

1527
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:50,219
best weed on Earth yeah and even when

1528
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:52,260
you miss it's still usually pretty good

1529
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:54,480
um but you know that there was better

1530
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,859
yeah especially you've already had

1531
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,539
better you're like that's what I mean

1532
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:59,338
yeah you know you know that you know

1533
00:59:57,539 --> 01:00:00,900
that there was better yeah

1534
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:03,480
um

1535
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,559
you know I don't know so let's get into

1536
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,480
the LA

1537
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,980
I'm gonna show off some of the headband

1538
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,940
delay right now

1539
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:15,059
all right so the LA is I told that story

1540
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:17,519
before as well but just so people know

1541
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:19,920
um the LA is the first headband that I

1542
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:22,440
got we got it about a year after the

1543
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:26,420
diesel so we got it in

1544
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:29,519
um 01 or so and I've we've had it since

1545
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:31,980
and it's we it used to get sold to sour

1546
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,599
all over the place but as you can see

1547
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,219
there's what Matt's throwing up that's

1548
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,500
the same Greenhouse that that East Coast

1549
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:40,078
Sour Diesel was in you can see that that

1550
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:42,780
thing throws straight bats compared to

1551
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:45,119
the ecsd is that the Malawi or a Durbin

1552
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:48,298
in the back yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1553
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:52,559
there's some sativas in the back over

1554
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:54,780
there uh some head stash along the wall

1555
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,900
um there might be some nl5 haze there

1556
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:00,359
might be a Malawi there's a Panama I

1557
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:03,420
think on the far on the right there's a

1558
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:07,019
Panama from uh CSI

1559
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:09,000
the old Canada's Panama or yeah there's

1560
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:11,099
there's some on that that those years

1561
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,960
whenever I can I like to throw

1562
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:14,760
experimental stuff out there and see

1563
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,559
what happens you know yeah I like

1564
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,619
putting plants in the sun if they if you

1565
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,599
can do that so yeah

1566
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:24,539
loves it

1567
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:26,460
uh yeah I liked her penalty you know I

1568
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:28,980
do I like it mixed in with other things

1569
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:31,559
more than just straight pure yeah

1570
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:33,480
astringent or penalene but

1571
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:36,119
um especially if it comes with a buzz

1572
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,039
that I like I can handle it yeah

1573
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:40,140
you know

1574
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:42,358
um but that's most things so yeah that's

1575
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:45,000
my that's my headband right there again

1576
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:48,358
I don't know lineage it's very

1577
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,980
it's very sour it's very diesel like

1578
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:52,318
um it's a little different in terms of

1579
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,699
its buzz but it's obviously you can just

1580
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:56,219
look at it it looks like it's from the

1581
01:01:53,699 --> 01:01:58,798
same family yeah it's bigger yielding

1582
01:01:56,219 --> 01:02:02,279
especially in the Sun

1583
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,599
um and uh it's it's uh it's one of my

1584
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,980
favorites

1585
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,039
um for a lot of times a lot of people

1586
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:10,798
can't tell the difference

1587
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:12,539
um you know uh and a lot of growth hour

1588
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,900
huh I can't tell the difference between

1589
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:17,880
this and what sour yeah okay that makes

1590
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,039
sense just like it's like to them it's

1591
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,019
like in fact there was a bunch of people

1592
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:23,759
that would just call it sour

1593
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:26,639
and then they would come up looking for

1594
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,619
that sour yeah and it's mostly because

1595
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,818
of the buzz you know it has a really

1596
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,380
great buzz and it has a really great

1597
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:33,119
nose

1598
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,700
um and so for a long time when it came

1599
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,440
to diesel family I had that cut and I

1600
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:40,019
had that Sour Diesel cut that you showed

1601
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,480
way earlier and I was super happy with

1602
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:43,980
those two things for a long time yeah

1603
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,420
you know there are some of my I mean

1604
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,240
I've grown them over and over and over

1605
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:50,338
again in every situation imaginable

1606
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:52,379
Outdoors greenhouses like that one

1607
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:53,880
indoor

1608
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,500
um Outdoors is the biggest pain in the

1609
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,019
ass because you kind of have to go till

1610
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,699
close to November

1611
01:02:58,019 --> 01:03:03,000
in there right I think those pictures

1612
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:05,039
were taken probably like October 25th

1613
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,358
something like that not this year it was

1614
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,739
this is a number of years ago now but

1615
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:09,659
that was late October right before

1616
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:12,358
Halloween yeah

1617
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:14,519
um and so they do better sometimes as as

1618
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:16,078
as Greenhouse plants

1619
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:17,599
um because

1620
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,940
um you really have to get nice weather

1621
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:23,460
to get them to their full end

1622
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,740
they take a while to form out you know

1623
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,659
so there's a lot of times where

1624
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:29,818
um like like we just did like right uh

1625
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:32,279
right after right after Halloween I'm

1626
01:03:29,818 --> 01:03:34,199
cutting it down yeah or I try to get as

1627
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,760
close to Halloween as I can and even go

1628
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:37,439
a little past it if the weather stays

1629
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,720
nice

1630
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,099
um and if you're in a greenhouse

1631
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:42,838
um you're a little more protected from

1632
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:44,400
the weather so you can inch out a few

1633
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:47,039
more days

1634
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,720
right yep because it doesn't get as cold

1635
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,358
you don't get Dew and you don't get all

1636
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:52,139
that other stuff but yeah that's the

1637
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:53,759
um

1638
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:55,199
you know that's the headband and those

1639
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,079
weren't very big plants those were just

1640
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:00,298
plants put in 15 gallon pots

1641
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,039
vegged for probably three weeks four

1642
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:04,739
weeks and then and then they got flipped

1643
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:07,440
how did she change from um Greenhouse to

1644
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:10,919
indoor what how does she vary

1645
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,220
you know uh

1646
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:16,079
she's changed a lot so in the beginning

1647
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:18,899
it didn't really matter where you grew

1648
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,720
her she was a champ in fact there's a

1649
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:23,579
lot of old buddies of mine that

1650
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:25,679
um changed their whole sense situation

1651
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:28,140
by growing that inside because you get

1652
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,460
basically one and a half to two per

1653
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:30,719
light

1654
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,720
um and that's back in like the old

1655
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:35,219
single-ended hortiluxe days yeah

1656
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:39,239
um you'd get one and a half to two per

1657
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:40,558
light all the time no problem uh and it

1658
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:43,858
was Fireweed

1659
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,019
yeah and outside she was a little bit

1660
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:48,298
more she like I said she was you get

1661
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:50,219
good years and bad years right because

1662
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:53,059
there's a potential on that if you don't

1663
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:55,618
know the the bud to size ratio going on

1664
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:58,920
you can get you can get a lot of larf

1665
01:04:55,619 --> 01:05:00,358
yeah you can get a lot of almost weed

1666
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,858
right

1667
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:03,239
um and so there was a long time when you

1668
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:05,219
were growing weed where like there

1669
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:08,338
wasn't this like modern hash market like

1670
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:10,199
there is today so a ton of larf would

1671
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:13,019
make your Tremors cry and was also

1672
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:15,239
problematic yeah right so you had to

1673
01:05:13,019 --> 01:05:18,239
know how to trim that thing up and I'll

1674
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:20,639
say now as she's aged she likes probably

1675
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:23,639
greenhouses the best

1676
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,940
she can still do really well inside but

1677
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:28,379
she doesn't like bulb heat yeah if that

1678
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:31,380
makes any sense

1679
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:32,760
she's fine with like like like actual

1680
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:35,280
nature Heat

1681
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,720
but there's something about heat from a

1682
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,000
lamp

1683
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:40,679
that she just does not Vibe with at all

1684
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,760
and one thing I should I should shout

1685
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:43,919
out because I have some friends that

1686
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,079
have tried to grow her she eats like a

1687
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,500
champ

1688
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:51,359
she is can be really hard the more she

1689
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:53,338
variegates the hungrier she is

1690
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,739
interesting so when she's perfectly

1691
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:58,920
healthy it's actually really hard to

1692
01:05:55,739 --> 01:06:01,019
find the variegation on her anywhere

1693
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,298
and if you bloom her when she's heavily

1694
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:05,900
variegated she won't come out nearly as

1695
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:05,900
nice a wheat

1696
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:12,000
um and so she needs strong food and she

1697
01:06:08,338 --> 01:06:14,219
needs calcium not so much Cal Mag but

1698
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,599
excess calcium

1699
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:17,338
you know

1700
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,019
um you can just put in straight cow

1701
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:21,539
without without the mag and she does

1702
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:23,338
good but uh but if she can be hard to

1703
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:25,380
feed all the sours can be hard to feed

1704
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:28,259
you over feed the sour at the wrong time

1705
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:30,480
and you kind of ruined it the ecsd

1706
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,460
doesn't like as much heavy feeding as

1707
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,780
like that that one probably would like

1708
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,420
it sounds

1709
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:38,579
no and I I didn't I didn't actually like

1710
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,139
send you those pics but from that from

1711
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:42,960
that same Greenhouse but the following

1712
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:44,879
year I have this picture of like uh

1713
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,679
probably like 40 or 50 East Coast sour

1714
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,960
diesels growing in front and then my

1715
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:51,538
sour growing behind it and they're

1716
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,440
almost done and there's like this sea of

1717
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:54,780
green

1718
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,760
with the ecsd and then as soon as it

1719
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,160
hits mine it's all yellow and brown

1720
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,920
because all those big fan leaves are

1721
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:04,500
eating themselves and dying yeah before

1722
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,838
before Harvest or whatever so it's like

1723
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:10,019
it's like a line in the greenhouse you

1724
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:11,460
can clearly see where it starts

1725
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:14,280
um and that's one of the reasons why

1726
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:16,380
like I think that side by sides are so

1727
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,839
cool because to really assure that like

1728
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,640
people all the time now on IG especially

1729
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:22,679
they reach out and they want to like

1730
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:24,298
identify Cuts based off a couple of

1731
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:27,358
picks and something their Buddy says

1732
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:28,798
yeah it's really hard to do that with a

1733
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,358
lot of cuts

1734
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,519
you know

1735
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:34,019
um the best case scenario for proving

1736
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:36,480
it's real is either getting it to

1737
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:37,920
someone that you hope can identify it or

1738
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,719
trying to get the cut from a different

1739
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,240
source and growing them side by side and

1740
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:43,739
seeing what you can see yeah

1741
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:45,538
you know

1742
01:07:43,739 --> 01:07:46,739
so

1743
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:50,000
um

1744
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:50,000
you know they uh

1745
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:53,599
I got distracted by the comments yeah me

1746
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:56,519
too

1747
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,859
because dude is convinced headbanger is

1748
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:00,659
in that [ __ ] line I'm like oh [ __ ]

1749
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:04,199
I was there when he was making that

1750
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:06,420
stupid ass I mean come on so you know

1751
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:08,639
but that's the thing is is that

1752
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:11,639
as far as diesel goes it's been reborn

1753
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:13,739
yep there's new Legends there's new

1754
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:15,900
stuff going on there's new I mean even

1755
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:17,519
like you know there's some that I didn't

1756
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,319
name just because I don't even like the

1757
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,759
people that that attach their name to it

1758
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:22,020
so I haven't but there's other people

1759
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:24,000
that

1760
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:28,199
um offer seeds of it

1761
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,319
yeah bx's of it you know yeah things

1762
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:33,419
along those lines

1763
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:36,539
huh oh no there's no ibls in the LA Kush

1764
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,759
yet that's right no no but a but of but

1765
01:08:36,539 --> 01:08:40,619
of of of sour and stuff like that

1766
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:42,420
there's not even any seed lines of La

1767
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:45,119
out there other than What CSI is

1768
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:46,739
released yeah um but the popularity of

1769
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:48,420
me talking about it and the fact that he

1770
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:51,899
released it and people found a bunch of

1771
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:54,380
fire and especially in the in the

1772
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:57,358
um La by chemd

1773
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:59,759
it was fire too I gotta smoke a bunch of

1774
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,920
that yeah has led to a bunch of people

1775
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,960
on you know clone Sellers and various

1776
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,779
breeders all claiming that they have it

1777
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:08,219
because people like it yeah yeah

1778
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:10,799
um but I don't think they have it

1779
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:14,060
probably not but it's okay no it's okay

1780
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:14,060
it's okay to to want

1781
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:17,579
yeah I mean and there's also a thing too

1782
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,080
where it's like it's not even like I'm

1783
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:20,219
trying to sit on my high horse about it

1784
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:22,798
or whatever it's just one of those

1785
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:24,420
things where it's like when interest and

1786
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:25,979
money comes along in something all of a

1787
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,659
sudden it appears in places

1788
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:29,159
yeah and especially the people that

1789
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:30,719
aren't like particularly concerned about

1790
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:32,639
history or lineage and they're just

1791
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,039
trying to make a buck sure they're going

1792
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,980
to offer it for 500 bucks a clone yeah

1793
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:40,079
maybe 15 or 20 people bite on it they

1794
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:42,238
make and they make a chunk of money

1795
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:44,838
yeah and all they needed was a Sharpie

1796
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,838
and a label

1797
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,319
so

1798
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:52,140
um but yeah I mean I think

1799
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:54,840
honestly uh I don't have any idea if my

1800
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,699
headband is the real headband or the

1801
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:02,579
first headband or the one from New York

1802
01:09:56,698 --> 01:10:05,219
I know we got it as headband in 2001.

1803
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:06,000
um we had it since and

1804
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:09,000
um

1805
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,920
just having grown it for that long I

1806
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,600
would definitely say it's closely

1807
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,560
related to sour

1808
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,500
yeah

1809
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,539
how whether it's a parent or a sister or

1810
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,500
a half sister or some I couldn't tell

1811
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:22,198
you

1812
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,939
I don't have definitive proof but just

1813
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:26,460
just looking at all those picks you can

1814
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:29,460
obviously tell and then you know if you

1815
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:30,658
had a bag of it or whatever it it is I

1816
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,960
mean some people it's their favorite

1817
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:36,599
wheat it could be diesel bag seed it

1818
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,399
could be any of the number of any up and

1819
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,620
down the line it could be the original

1820
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:45,299
it could be next to the original it

1821
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:47,880
could be 19. she she variegates uh like

1822
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:49,619
the like the chemd yeah that's so weird

1823
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:51,600
but it makes sense though because it's

1824
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:53,039
just to me it's a super skunk trade I

1825
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,340
see it through all different weird super

1826
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:57,779
scones without having to even touch 10d

1827
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:01,020
you know

1828
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:03,359
um so I almost I am I've almost had this

1829
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,280
thing that like I wondered like you know

1830
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,559
I mean who knows but this is really

1831
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:10,679
speculation but I was like what if what

1832
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:13,679
if Kim D is like an Afghan expression of

1833
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:16,619
of dog super skunk

1834
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:19,380
and the headband is like a sativa

1835
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:21,179
expression of dog super skunk

1836
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:23,699
it's definitely possible definitely

1837
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:25,500
impossible within the fan I'm not saying

1838
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:27,299
it's the only thing in either one I'm

1839
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,979
just throwing it out there is like when

1840
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:30,539
I look at them and I look at how things

1841
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:33,238
grow and I look at like Leaf

1842
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:35,100
similarities and stuff like that

1843
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:38,879
um they're obviously closely related in

1844
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:40,380
some way it's just how yeah

1845
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,420
um but the most important thing is to me

1846
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:44,039
like though that sour and that LA are

1847
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,140
two of my all-time favorite they're

1848
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:49,140
probably in my top five

1849
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:51,659
I could smoke them all year every day I

1850
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,440
really enjoy them a whole bunch

1851
01:11:51,658 --> 01:11:53,879
um

1852
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:55,500
and I like quite a few of the other

1853
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,779
diesels too I'm not trying to put mine

1854
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,520
on a pedestal or anything like that what

1855
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:02,219
do you think about people who qualify

1856
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,920
diesels as roadkill skunk do you think

1857
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:07,500
that they are potentially in the same

1858
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,619
scent profile do you think what are your

1859
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,658
thoughts on that I I would agree

1860
01:12:09,619 --> 01:12:16,079
diesel I think I think when you get that

1861
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:19,920
fuel nose I think that's only like a

1862
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:22,800
couple degrees away from skunk nose yeah

1863
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,739
it's got the same like it's got the same

1864
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,039
like nose crinkle like is this offensive

1865
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:31,500
you know bright strong

1866
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:34,039
um I actually think that that sour and

1867
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:37,679
Diesel family is modern

1868
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:39,899
skunk yeah I think it's the modern skunk

1869
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,699
family that survived and we just were

1870
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:44,099
hunting for this thing that like mostly

1871
01:12:41,698 --> 01:12:45,419
exists and I'm gonna make you qualify

1872
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,739
this again because you always say this

1873
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:48,480
you say it's a modern skunk family do

1874
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:50,759
you mean modern skunk one family do you

1875
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:53,279
mean modern Afghan family by Skunk or do

1876
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,560
you mean by the scent profile the

1877
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:59,880
weather does it grow like I mean I mean

1878
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:01,500
modern I think so to me like it I

1879
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,940
actually probably think it like this

1880
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,020
could get me in trouble too but I think

1881
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:06,779
it's like

1882
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:08,460
I think it's like I think Sour Diesel is

1883
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:11,158
like ancient skunk

1884
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:14,039
but improved and what I mean by that is

1885
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:17,698
it's like imagine if instead of breeding

1886
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:19,079
it towards Citrus and floral and grapes

1887
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:23,460
and all that

1888
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:26,219
you bread it towards gas and Fuel and

1889
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:28,800
headband Aromas and weird nose crinkle

1890
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:31,140
and sour right

1891
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,400
and but we've never seen that in spunk

1892
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,679
one

1893
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,779
huh but we've never seen that definitely

1894
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:38,819
not in pure no no I mean I think you

1895
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:40,259
know I think he I think he intentionally

1896
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:42,479
bred away from that and I also don't

1897
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,880
think that this is pure skunk

1898
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:46,379
um you know

1899
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,579
it's it's obviously got some cheminic

1900
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,920
and that's where and I think that's

1901
01:13:47,579 --> 01:13:51,840
where the power some of the power and

1902
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,420
some of the added density and stuff like

1903
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,340
that comes from

1904
01:13:53,420 --> 01:14:00,140
you tend to think it's more uh skunk one

1905
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,140
based as opposed to the Afghan tea base

1906
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:04,679
I mean I don't know I don't know if I

1907
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,880
would say that I

1908
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:10,920
but I also don't like qual I mean

1909
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:13,020
to be I didn't I didn't send you this

1910
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,158
pic either but that but our same friend

1911
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,880
uh

1912
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,879
um

1913
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:21,480
bald eagle he had this Colombian strain

1914
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:23,940
yeah remember I yeah I lost those in the

1915
01:14:21,479 --> 01:14:26,939
fire yeah I have a picture of the

1916
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:30,238
headband right next to that Colombian

1917
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:32,639
and they're not the same but man would

1918
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,799
do they look related see to me when I

1919
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,600
look at like Greenhouse plants and

1920
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,880
outdoor plants they all kind of look the

1921
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,960
same I don't have that train die so it's

1922
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,060
hard for me you have a lot more

1923
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,039
experience in the greenhouse seeing the

1924
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,600
the variation between plants and stuff

1925
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:48,000
so I think it would be hard for someone

1926
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,640
who doesn't have that like me to to be

1927
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,158
able to see that that similarity past it

1928
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,500
all looks kind of similar yeah I mean

1929
01:14:53,158 --> 01:14:58,559
that's one of the benefits of growing in

1930
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:00,539
Mendocino County in in the 215 era was

1931
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,460
that you got to do indoor you got to do

1932
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:03,960
light depths you got to do outdoor

1933
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,119
Greenhouse you got to do all these

1934
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:08,100
different kinds and so for someone like

1935
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:10,439
me who keeps a lot of the same strains

1936
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:12,600
around for a long time that means you

1937
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:15,779
get a lot of different expressions of

1938
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:17,760
the same strain and you really you

1939
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:19,500
really get to see how it performs in

1940
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,420
different conditions it's super

1941
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:24,238
important to have that eye I think I I

1942
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:25,859
lack that for uh greenhouse and outdoor

1943
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:27,899
but it's one of those things that I'd

1944
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:30,000
like to eventually at some point in my

1945
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:31,079
life catch up on because it I think it's

1946
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,579
super important to be able to have that

1947
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:34,198
I almost feel bad now because I got

1948
01:15:32,579 --> 01:15:36,600
distracted and I could I could have dug

1949
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:38,879
on my phone and given you various picks

1950
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:40,500
from inside and different things and

1951
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,260
shown you how many how many different

1952
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,840
kooky ways they actually look yeah I

1953
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:47,579
mean Expressions the most interesting

1954
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,940
part to me as I learn more about it and

1955
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:52,979
how plastic these uh these plants are so

1956
01:15:50,939 --> 01:15:56,698
if you want to take it a step back

1957
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:58,379
though right yeah is that until I saw

1958
01:15:56,698 --> 01:16:01,198
those Colombians

1959
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:04,020
right yeah it clicked something in me

1960
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:05,219
because before there was this aspect of

1961
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,420
like

1962
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:08,219
um

1963
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,899
you know of the Colombians that you

1964
01:16:08,219 --> 01:16:11,939
would see would be these big huge crazy

1965
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:14,099
stretchy things I'd never really seen

1966
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:15,919
like too many like somewhat bred

1967
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,980
Colombians in a certain direction

1968
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:22,560
and when I saw that I was like oh so

1969
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:23,359
obviously in Skunk there's a Colombian

1970
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,940
element

1971
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:28,500
right what if sour diesels and this

1972
01:16:26,939 --> 01:16:30,000
headband and stuff like that are you

1973
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,819
talking about skunk one

1974
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,340
yeah 100 okay okay because when I think

1975
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:37,399
skunk I think Afghan afghanist because

1976
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:41,039
that's what the first term is gonna work

1977
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:43,439
so I think to be to be fair right just

1978
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:45,899
to take it even a further step back is

1979
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:48,839
that it seems like no matter what story

1980
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:51,299
of Sour Diesel or headband or anything

1981
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:54,239
like that you believe that it was a

1982
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:56,699
merger of the chem family

1983
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:58,619
right with this with the skunk family

1984
01:16:56,698 --> 01:17:01,738
and whether you believe that was the MSS

1985
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:05,158
cut or you believe it was the RFK cut or

1986
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:07,919
you believe it was the the DNL cut right

1987
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:11,039
uh yeah whatever whatever whatever tale

1988
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,719
of origin you want to lean on they all

1989
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:16,079
seem to agree that there was this

1990
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:18,600
blending of chem family and some kind of

1991
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,880
90s skunk family yeah

1992
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,620
right and so what happens when you blend

1993
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,300
those things

1994
01:17:22,619 --> 01:17:26,340
that's what I think all these different

1995
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,420
diesels are showing us

1996
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:30,119
okay

1997
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:31,619
in a way if I had if I had to get get my

1998
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:32,880
guess on it too

1999
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:34,920
um and there's some that lean more

2000
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:38,460
Afghan and there's some that lean more

2001
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:40,199
sativa yeah because it's in there right

2002
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:42,359
there's probably there's probably more

2003
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:45,059
Afghan than sativa but like you look

2004
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:47,579
it's there's a reason why really good

2005
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:50,219
diesel takes you know and a lot of

2006
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:52,319
people in a lot of cases 11 or 12 or 13

2007
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:54,600
weeks

2008
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,099
yeah right that's pretty there's a lot

2009
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:58,560
of that there's a lot of Afghans that

2010
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:00,780
run 11 to 12 weeks too though no that's

2011
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,159
true yeah there's a lot but the reason I

2012
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:03,539
was asking was because recently you know

2013
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:05,639
I've been digging through the old High

2014
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:07,380
Times a lot in the old yeah magazines

2015
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,420
and all the homegrowns so what I've been

2016
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:11,340
doing is going through the old THM cues

2017
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:15,480
and I've been going through up until

2018
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:17,039
about 1985 going through all those and

2019
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:18,839
trying to figure out where was the first

2020
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:20,819
time people were using the term skunk

2021
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,400
for cannabis because like we kind of

2022
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:24,960
know that like the term skunky started

2023
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:26,460
hitting heavy in the afghanis but I

2024
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,698
wanted to see if anybody was referring

2025
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:32,300
to Mexicans or Colombians or any of that

2026
01:18:29,698 --> 01:18:35,219
other stuff at any point before the 80s

2027
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:37,560
never happened never happened in any of

2028
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:39,480
these magazines or any of that up until

2029
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,280
they started referring to afghanis as

2030
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:43,738
skunk you know then you started getting

2031
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:46,380
red hair skunk and you know Afghani

2032
01:18:43,738 --> 01:18:49,259
skunk or that's skunk bud uh Kentucky

2033
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:50,760
skunk but it took up until that so I

2034
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:52,619
don't even know if any of the Colombians

2035
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,079
or Mexicans truly had that kind of scent

2036
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:57,000
profile to be adding to it

2037
01:18:55,079 --> 01:19:00,960
um to make a skull

2038
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,380
I mean the thing is is that so if you

2039
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,719
take let's say for instance that just

2040
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:09,239
just for the sake of pure argument with

2041
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:12,420
with speculation right

2042
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:13,738
that the L the headband or the sour

2043
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:16,500
diesel or something like that is a

2044
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:21,359
combination of some blend of super skunk

2045
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:23,340
and some blend of Cam yeah right

2046
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,119
if you just take that right there then

2047
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:29,940
from the super skunk side you have

2048
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:32,460
Colombian Mexican some kind of Afghan

2049
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:34,500
and then Afghan tea

2050
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:37,020
yes right

2051
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:39,060
and then from the chem dog side you have

2052
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:41,640
no [ __ ] idea but you have some kind

2053
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:43,739
of some kind of weird old Afghan mix

2054
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:46,980
yeah probably

2055
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:50,039
right yeah and so it's it's more Afghan

2056
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:51,359
than it is than it is sativa but that

2057
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:54,000
doesn't mean that some of them couldn't

2058
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:56,698
have a tall leggy

2059
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,619
growth rate from some of that Colombian

2060
01:19:56,698 --> 01:20:00,960
or some of that Mexican oh yeah yeah

2061
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:02,760
that's all that's all I'm saying I was

2062
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,500
more referring to the scent profile of

2063
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,780
skunk that most people identify with

2064
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:09,179
skunk like that but even if even if you

2065
01:20:06,779 --> 01:20:11,759
consider what I just said is true then

2066
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:13,520
Sour Diesel would have the Afghan that

2067
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,560
was in Skunk one

2068
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,060
the Afghan tea the maple leaf that

2069
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,960
Neville mixed it with

2070
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:24,780
right and adding the Chemin

2071
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,760
and the chem which to me and this is

2072
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:29,039
what I'm bringing up right now so people

2073
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,840
can see the illustration of it I think

2074
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:33,500
is also Super Skunk so it'd be doubling

2075
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:37,319
up on The Afghan T if that was the case

2076
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,880
uh again I point to my little dog

2077
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:40,859
tongues

2078
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,159
um the fact that just a pure Super Skunk

2079
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:47,519
without anything else no chem in it does

2080
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:49,559
the same kind of leaf traits you know

2081
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,239
um yeah

2082
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,100
so that would be almost if that is the

2083
01:20:51,238 --> 01:20:54,718
case if I'm correct on that it would

2084
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:57,480
almost be like a doubling up on that

2085
01:20:54,719 --> 01:21:00,000
Afghan T reinforcing that

2086
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:03,119
and you know and as since we don't know

2087
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,939
the origin of the chem at all

2088
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:10,198
you know and yeah we're not even a

2089
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:11,939
hundred percent sure uh what the

2090
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:14,039
um you know we don't know anything about

2091
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:15,839
the origin of the of the maple leaf

2092
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:18,119
either other than it came to Neville

2093
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,279
labeled maple leaf maple leaf and he

2094
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:23,698
named some phenos yeah

2095
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:24,840
so there's a lot of mystery in there

2096
01:21:23,698 --> 01:21:28,319
um but

2097
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:31,619
I will say generally speaking about Sour

2098
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:34,738
is that it seems like it has a sativa

2099
01:21:31,619 --> 01:21:37,679
frame most of them right and then it

2100
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:39,718
stretches but then it has some more it

2101
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,520
varies how much Indica influences in the

2102
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:42,899
buds some of them are pretty chunky some

2103
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,800
of them are a little bit more feathery

2104
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:48,238
and a little bit more layered right yeah

2105
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,779
um and it has some density and some

2106
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:54,658
potency from the Afghan and it has you

2107
01:21:51,779 --> 01:21:56,759
know the the stretch and you know some

2108
01:21:54,658 --> 01:21:58,679
of the buzz from the sativa and it

2109
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:01,320
Blends in all these different weird ways

2110
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:03,719
yeah and it just depends on because

2111
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:05,759
honestly that that New York City Diesel

2112
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:07,859
I actually told you like when you when

2113
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,840
you look at it growing it was very

2114
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:11,579
similar in growth

2115
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:15,960
um in terms of the way the plant looked

2116
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:18,000
yeah to my headband cut except for it

2117
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:22,619
was about three or four feet shorter

2118
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,140
oh wow so it went like Squat and wide

2119
01:22:22,619 --> 01:22:27,779
right where mine kind of went big and

2120
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,300
tall and floppy but like as far as Leaf

2121
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:32,759
shape and and and you know serrations

2122
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:34,199
and leaf color and the way the bud

2123
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:36,840
formed there was quite a few

2124
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:38,759
similarities yeah it just looked like a

2125
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,779
much more Afghan version of the same

2126
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,360
thing

2127
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:44,698
it stayed shorter and squatter and wider

2128
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:47,099
and mine wanted to get tall and throw

2129
01:22:44,698 --> 01:22:48,539
like big forearms everywhere yeah I want

2130
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:50,280
to grow bald eagles someday that one

2131
01:22:48,539 --> 01:22:51,960
looked pretty cool yeah it did look I

2132
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:53,759
don't know if he has it anymore and I

2133
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,760
lost it in the fire

2134
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,760
fires

2135
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:03,779
kill him I mean starting in starting in

2136
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:07,219
2017 on I mean I got evacuated three

2137
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:10,019
times between 2017 and 2020.

2138
01:23:07,219 --> 01:23:12,300
three three different fires and so

2139
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:14,040
obviously when you're and you're

2140
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,179
evacuated it's really hard to care for

2141
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:17,698
your mother room

2142
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:22,520
yeah from a distance

2143
01:23:17,698 --> 01:23:24,419
yeah I'm losing my hair if that happened

2144
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:26,040
laughs

2145
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:28,020
could have had an effect there could be

2146
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:30,658
some grain that went on or whatever else

2147
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,739
I mean luckily I I share and I backed a

2148
01:23:30,658 --> 01:23:34,339
lot of stuff up from different people

2149
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:37,799
but I did lose some things in that era

2150
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:39,300
that I have not gotten back

2151
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,500
um this is a good question that you can

2152
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,820
actually comment on because I think

2153
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,560
you're working on this how about

2154
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:44,639
epigenetics affecting one cut to

2155
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,260
acclimate into two different

2156
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,900
environments over a period of time and

2157
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:51,619
reunite to be judged as being different

2158
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:54,899
or the same

2159
01:23:51,619 --> 01:23:57,179
I am doing that right now

2160
01:23:54,899 --> 01:24:01,500
um so we don't know

2161
01:23:57,179 --> 01:24:02,179
um but I will say that uh uh you know

2162
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:05,279
um

2163
01:24:02,179 --> 01:24:07,980
CSI and I have a little experiment going

2164
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:10,019
right where we gave each other our

2165
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:13,139
oldest Sour Diesel cuts

2166
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:16,880
and we gave each other our chem dog cuts

2167
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:19,020
and we gave each other our chemd Cuts

2168
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:22,020
uh and

2169
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:24,179
um we're we're going to see a if we

2170
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:26,880
think they're all the same

2171
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:29,399
uh and B

2172
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,659
um you know are there differences we're

2173
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:32,759
actually we're absolutely positive

2174
01:24:30,658 --> 01:24:35,460
actually that the the chem dog cut is

2175
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,860
the same but they've been separated for

2176
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:41,039
you know I mean I think he got it in 06

2177
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:42,960
yeah you know so they've been completely

2178
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,479
separated and never exchanged for the

2179
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,039
last 17 years between the two of us yeah

2180
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:48,899
I'm fascinated by this because I've

2181
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:51,600
always had that theory about acclimation

2182
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:53,819
and stuff and um I'm very interested to

2183
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,679
see how plastic the chem 91 cut is and

2184
01:24:53,819 --> 01:24:58,500
and I also have another theory because

2185
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:01,319
chem 91 even in the s1s it's pretty

2186
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:02,640
freaking uniform so it's probably you

2187
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:04,859
know either bag seed bag seed

2188
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:08,699
unintentionally self or a work line

2189
01:25:04,859 --> 01:25:08,698
whatever it is so

2190
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:13,440
between the two

2191
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:16,559
I have something interesting I could add

2192
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:18,960
to that yeah uh which is not it's not

2193
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,340
definitive by any level right

2194
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,880
um but

2195
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:27,360
um when him and I traded right

2196
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:30,060
uh he runs a pretty simple uh organic

2197
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:32,039
setup these days right yeah

2198
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,719
um and it's it's you know a lot most of

2199
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:35,340
his most of his blooms are geared

2200
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:37,020
towards seed making which is obviously

2201
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:38,579
different right

2202
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:40,440
um but we obviously veg different we

2203
01:25:38,579 --> 01:25:42,000
were having a convo last week I think

2204
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:44,460
and we were talking about different

2205
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,520
methods and I do something right now

2206
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:49,980
that I that uh some people call synganic

2207
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,480
right which is that especially in my

2208
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:53,639
mom's or whatever and I've been

2209
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,859
traveling and stuff it's been easier for

2210
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,920
me to blend some organic and some salt

2211
01:25:55,859 --> 01:26:05,039
together yeah and use that to grow my

2212
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:06,560
plants right so huh heresy I know I know

2213
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:09,600
I mean for you it's probably that I used

2214
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,820
so much hate mail because yeah yeah you

2215
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:15,120
know organic [ __ ] you're like oh my God

2216
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:17,939
give me the salt you know Salt Life bro

2217
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:20,219
but so I yeah I grew a blend of I grew a

2218
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:24,079
blend of salt and and organic amendments

2219
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:24,079
and stuff like that inside right and and

2220
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:28,079
so I traded him some stuff and he hit me

2221
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,000
up and he was like man

2222
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:32,579
and I was like what he's like

2223
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,859
your plants smell way stronger in veg

2224
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:36,479
than mine do yep

2225
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:38,819
that's cool which I found was pretty

2226
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:40,019
interesting yeah we started so we

2227
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:42,179
started chatting about what we were

2228
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:44,159
feeding them you know

2229
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:47,219
um and you know and when he was growing

2230
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:48,359
flour for market right he used to do all

2231
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:50,158
these different you know he's through

2232
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:51,899
all these teas and all these amendments

2233
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:53,698
and all these extra special things all

2234
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:55,920
the time to get it just exactly perfect

2235
01:26:53,698 --> 01:26:57,719
and now he's you know he's got he's got

2236
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,940
a decent amount of stuff going on so

2237
01:26:57,719 --> 01:27:01,980
he's like he tries to keep it simple

2238
01:26:59,939 --> 01:27:04,259
yeah and he grows really nice weed but

2239
01:27:01,979 --> 01:27:07,678
it's like he you know he's vegging

2240
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:09,840
organically with a lot of dry amendments

2241
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,940
and I'm using some of that and then some

2242
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,500
salt and he was he he straight up was

2243
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:16,919
like every plant you gave me is more

2244
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:19,859
pungent in my mom room than my own [ __ ]

2245
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:21,300
in veg

2246
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:23,519
which I thought was kind of an

2247
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:26,699
interesting observation yeah I don't

2248
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:29,100
know what that's gonna lead to or

2249
01:27:26,698 --> 01:27:31,019
anything else but

2250
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:32,100
it was uh

2251
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:35,100
um

2252
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:37,199
you know uh yeah it was interesting that

2253
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:39,420
he already had that kind of feedback on

2254
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:42,899
it without even blooming it

2255
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:45,060
was like your plans smelled stronger

2256
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:46,439
you know in veg I noticed it when I

2257
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,760
brush him and when I touch him and when

2258
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:49,979
I work with him and then I go and I work

2259
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,260
on the same strain that's mine and it's

2260
01:27:49,979 --> 01:27:54,419
more muted

2261
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:56,820
whatever that means

2262
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:59,300
isn't that interesting so we haven't

2263
01:27:56,819 --> 01:27:59,299
yeah

2264
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:06,000
well I mean what I think it means

2265
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:07,380
personally is that the plant Wants What

2266
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,539
It Wants

2267
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:12,600
right and if you give the plant

2268
01:28:09,539 --> 01:28:16,139
everything that it wants as far as food

2269
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:17,880
right then it's able to do all the

2270
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:21,239
various processes it wants to do and

2271
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,980
reach its potential yep and I think a

2272
01:28:21,238 --> 01:28:25,319
lot of times with Organic especially

2273
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:27,959
indoor organic

2274
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:30,599
um you're not actually giving the plant

2275
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:33,840
everything that it wants all the time

2276
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:35,280
yeah it's because because it's like I I

2277
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,920
kind of look at it this like might be

2278
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:40,079
blasphemy for people or whatever but I

2279
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,600
kind of look at it like organic gives

2280
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:44,698
the plant a lot of things that it likes

2281
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,219
but sometimes it struggles to give the

2282
01:28:44,698 --> 01:28:49,559
plan exactly what it needs yeah because

2283
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:51,420
when you give a plant really really high

2284
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:52,560
quality and I don't mean Athena or

2285
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:54,600
anything like that but like like

2286
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,980
something like Canna or Cutting Edge or

2287
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:58,679
somebody that's actually decent if you

2288
01:28:55,979 --> 01:29:00,718
give them really high quality salts

2289
01:28:58,679 --> 01:29:02,158
um the plant has to do nothing but

2290
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,739
absorb those

2291
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:06,719
and it's a lie that people talk about

2292
01:29:04,738 --> 01:29:11,039
where if you use any salt at all you'll

2293
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:12,840
kill all of your beneficials yeah people

2294
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:14,698
don't know this but like or some people

2295
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:17,940
don't know this but the plant absorbs

2296
01:29:14,698 --> 01:29:20,279
salt through its roots

2297
01:29:17,939 --> 01:29:22,319
that's what it absorbs and you can't

2298
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:24,000
tell the difference between assault from

2299
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,279
like Cutting Edge or Canna and a salt

2300
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,658
that's organically derived oh my God

2301
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:30,840
you're going to make so many people so

2302
01:29:27,658 --> 01:29:32,879
upset and it is true it's true Superior

2303
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:34,860
I'm not saying that one superior to the

2304
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,600
other because no but it is true what I'm

2305
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:38,339
saying is is that

2306
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,679
what I'm saying is is that like when you

2307
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,480
when you bathe a plant in in nutrient

2308
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:44,399
that has salts in it it's almost like an

2309
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:45,959
IV the plant has to do nothing it can

2310
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:48,479
just as long as the ph and the

2311
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:50,279
temperature is right it can just absorb

2312
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:52,379
that food right up into it

2313
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:55,319
where in Organics

2314
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:57,500
oh man when in Organics uh he agrees

2315
01:29:55,319 --> 01:30:00,840
those same salts and those same things

2316
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:03,060
are bound up in like more complicated

2317
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,800
chains that have to be broken down by

2318
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:07,500
microbes and bacteria and stuff to

2319
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,119
release the salts yeah doesn't mean that

2320
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:12,119
Organics not going to do other stuff

2321
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:14,579
like enzymes and and you know a whole

2322
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:16,260
like soil food web and you know mycelium

2323
01:30:14,579 --> 01:30:17,880
and different things that like so

2324
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:19,619
there's all this complexity to it but

2325
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:21,840
essentially

2326
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:25,319
um it's really really really hard to get

2327
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:28,260
a perfect organic mix indoors in pots

2328
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:30,420
especially small pots yeah much easier

2329
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:33,000
to do in beds it's much easier to do in

2330
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:35,219
large amounts of soil than small so when

2331
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,139
you have a bunch of moms you know like

2332
01:30:35,219 --> 01:30:38,819
uh CSI does you're a lot of times you're

2333
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:41,460
growing them in anywhere from four inch

2334
01:30:38,819 --> 01:30:44,579
to two gallon pots yeah

2335
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:46,980
I found in the in smaller pots it's

2336
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:49,139
easier to be syngantic and have a bunch

2337
01:30:46,979 --> 01:30:52,619
of and have a your a bunch of organic

2338
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:54,359
and then still feed a light PPM or EC

2339
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:56,698
whatever you choose to use salt base

2340
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:59,039
yeah and then that just kind of gives

2341
01:30:56,698 --> 01:31:00,599
and to me the goal of an old Mom

2342
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:03,119
especially some of these things are 25

2343
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,679
30 years old is like keeping them as

2344
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:06,899
healthy as possible

2345
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:09,779
yeah these are things that are annuals

2346
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:12,299
that should be dying yeah well you know

2347
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:14,099
as as Matt will tell you like once you

2348
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,960
get a plant unhealthy sometimes it can

2349
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:18,360
be a real struggle to get it back to

2350
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:21,179
being fully healthy sometimes you can

2351
01:31:18,359 --> 01:31:23,039
see Cuts I've never seen bee go back to

2352
01:31:21,179 --> 01:31:24,779
what they were ever no matter how

2353
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:28,260
healthy you try to get them you know now

2354
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:30,960
you know what what happens too is that

2355
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:32,820
when it is true that that salts will

2356
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,639
kill some Organics but that's mostly at

2357
01:31:32,819 --> 01:31:37,380
like high ECS and stuff like that if

2358
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:39,179
you're feeding really low or moderate

2359
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,739
it's not going to really kill your

2360
01:31:39,179 --> 01:31:42,079
beneficial bacteria or do anything like

2361
01:31:40,738 --> 01:31:46,319
that because

2362
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:48,119
the organic is producing salts too

2363
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:49,799
and a lot of times when people go into

2364
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:51,539
the store and they buy bottles of

2365
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:53,520
organic nutrient like let's say you're

2366
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:55,500
going to buy some kind of like some kind

2367
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,360
of blend but the reason why that should

2368
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,920
cause money the reason why that [ __ ]

2369
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:01,859
costs money is because they already

2370
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:04,619
brewed it and made some of those big

2371
01:32:01,859 --> 01:32:06,599
like organic chains break down and some

2372
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:08,539
of those organically derived salts are

2373
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:11,340
in the mix waiting to be used already

2374
01:32:08,539 --> 01:32:13,920
yeah it's not like you just have to like

2375
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:15,360
you know dust bone meal or blood meal or

2376
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,719
something like that and like wait for

2377
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:20,359
them to break it down yeah most organic

2378
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,100
liquid amendments are just people

2379
01:32:20,359 --> 01:32:25,079
breaking it down for you ahead of time

2380
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,159
so that it's easier and more readily

2381
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:28,260
available

2382
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,299
yep and easier to apply

2383
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:31,980
you know but some stuff you put in your

2384
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:33,119
soil it might take two three months to

2385
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:34,738
even break down

2386
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:37,198
yeah and what rate does it break down

2387
01:32:34,738 --> 01:32:39,599
what if your plant wants more of it then

2388
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:41,339
you have to offer

2389
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:44,100
I'm not trying to get off on some kind

2390
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:46,079
of nutrition tangent but I will say and

2391
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:49,560
this can tie into Sour Diesel

2392
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:52,219
that I'll tell you a funny story from my

2393
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:54,420
friend John who runs Cutting Edge okay

2394
01:32:52,219 --> 01:32:55,920
uh there's this product he came out

2395
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:57,600
which is a carbohydrate product which

2396
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,340
has some potassium in it that's called

2397
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:02,280
sugary

2398
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:05,100
yeah right uh it's a carbohydrate-based

2399
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:06,779
sugar product so he's got these clients

2400
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,920
back in the east coast to grow a ton of

2401
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:11,219
Sour Diesel and they call them up

2402
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,600
Furious your [ __ ] ruined our diesel

2403
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:14,158
yeah what do you mean it ruined our

2404
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,020
diesel how did it ruin our diesel your

2405
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:17,698
[ __ ] ruined our it made our diesel taste

2406
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:20,699
sweet

2407
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:22,138
right yeah so they're all pissed off

2408
01:33:20,698 --> 01:33:24,960
because to them they have to have the

2409
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:27,359
nose yeah so he actually made a product

2410
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:30,119
called sour d

2411
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:33,000
right which is the exact same product as

2412
01:33:30,119 --> 01:33:34,859
sugary but instead of extracting the

2413
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,979
carbohydrates and sugar from sweet

2414
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:39,960
fruits yeah he extracted them from tart

2415
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:41,759
Sour Apples

2416
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,679
interesting and that made it and then

2417
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:48,739
those and then those people grew it

2418
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:48,739
using that and the sour flavor came back

2419
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:55,260
so even even the development of the nose

2420
01:33:52,679 --> 01:33:57,359
could potentially be based on the type

2421
01:33:55,260 --> 01:34:00,539
of food you're using and what it

2422
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:03,179
balances at didn't we just say that when

2423
01:34:00,539 --> 01:34:04,859
elements are analyzed whether organic or

2424
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:07,079
salts

2425
01:34:04,859 --> 01:34:09,899
it will still be the same thing right

2426
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:12,658
exactly but so those those that's very

2427
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:13,859
true but that's the 17 macro and micro

2428
01:34:12,658 --> 01:34:16,138
elements

2429
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:20,000
okay that's not all that's

2430
01:34:16,139 --> 01:34:24,900
getting two different types of

2431
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:27,479
sugars that are just sugars

2432
01:34:24,899 --> 01:34:29,819
or two different carbs change maybe yeah

2433
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:32,759
maybe maybe the sugars and the carbs

2434
01:34:29,819 --> 01:34:34,319
like feed different bacteria oh that's a

2435
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,060
good point yeah you know that's a good

2436
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:37,738
point who knows I don't know I'm not I'm

2437
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:40,020
not saying I'm that that's not a story

2438
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:43,259
that has a definitive ending yeah it's

2439
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:44,940
just an anecdotal story of like he

2440
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:46,739
changed up his nutrient a little bit and

2441
01:34:44,939 --> 01:34:48,839
it changed the flavor profile of the

2442
01:34:46,738 --> 01:34:52,319
same strain yeah

2443
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:53,819
I remember Botanicare offered like grape

2444
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,139
sweet like all these different kinds of

2445
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:57,599
sweets I always wondered if that was

2446
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:59,659
legit like Berry and

2447
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,820
like yeah at the beginning it was just

2448
01:34:59,658 --> 01:35:05,158
and then they came out with Berry Sweet

2449
01:35:02,819 --> 01:35:08,519
and yeah they came out with a number of

2450
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:09,839
different ones you know and so I I

2451
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,400
haven't actually done that experiment

2452
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:14,639
with the sugary or anything like that

2453
01:35:11,399 --> 01:35:18,619
myself but I will say that I have some

2454
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:21,779
friends that grow in living soil

2455
01:35:18,619 --> 01:35:23,880
and they have some similar strains that

2456
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:26,639
uh that other friends I have run that

2457
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,139
grow in a very different style yeah and

2458
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:31,739
the

2459
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:34,579
um the living soil stuff is is overall

2460
01:35:31,738 --> 01:35:34,579
much sweeter

2461
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:40,439
um and you know much more biology

2462
01:35:38,039 --> 01:35:41,760
uh just I'm not even talking about so I

2463
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:45,419
just mean like the weed that comes out

2464
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:47,579
of it okay you know like it's it's it

2465
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:49,500
has like a it has like a sweeter like

2466
01:35:47,579 --> 01:35:52,260
some of those some of those like um

2467
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:54,060
other flavor profiles aren't pronounced

2468
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:56,579
and then I have a friend who grows the

2469
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:58,739
exact same stuff in salt and they get a

2470
01:35:56,579 --> 01:36:00,600
much different flavor profile than the

2471
01:35:58,738 --> 01:36:02,459
living soil people yeah I definitely

2472
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,960
believe that for sure so that's that's

2473
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:05,520
kind of what I'm saying is like I'm I'm

2474
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:07,560
not gonna sit here on this episode and

2475
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,540
try to like tell you anything definitive

2476
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:12,960
about why I'm just saying that certain

2477
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:15,479
strains are sensitive enough

2478
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,679
that even what style you're growing and

2479
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:18,419
what you're feeding them could

2480
01:36:16,679 --> 01:36:21,539
potentially impact

2481
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:24,779
the chain of things that occur that make

2482
01:36:21,539 --> 01:36:27,359
the nose that you perceive yeah

2483
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:30,559
that's what I'm saying you recognize do

2484
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:30,559
you recognize this cut yet

2485
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:37,319
the one we haven't touched on that cut

2486
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:40,980
this is the day wrecker which one you

2487
01:36:37,319 --> 01:36:40,979
haven't flowered yet wait

2488
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:50,400
yeah crap is that is the day record

2489
01:36:47,399 --> 01:36:52,738
this is what she looks like yep yep I

2490
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:54,658
have that

2491
01:36:52,738 --> 01:36:57,059
um I have I have had it for I don't know

2492
01:36:54,658 --> 01:36:59,399
yeah a number of years now right

2493
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:00,840
and I've never actually made a little

2494
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:02,939
dog tongue um so I don't have anything

2495
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:04,679
I've noticed the little dog tongues in

2496
01:37:02,939 --> 01:37:06,599
the the foxtails very it has a lot of

2497
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:09,600
sour traits

2498
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:12,420
no it does that's interesting I have not

2499
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,920
seen that picture of it I like a lot um

2500
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:15,359
some of these are gray skulls and some

2501
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:19,440
are

2502
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:20,819
um um THC uh uh I'm sorry I forgetting

2503
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:23,399
his name off top my head but he deserves

2504
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:25,679
credit they're great pictures but yeah

2505
01:37:23,399 --> 01:37:27,719
so yeah that that one is uh that one's

2506
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,940
also

2507
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:31,319
um that one's been percolating in the

2508
01:37:29,939 --> 01:37:33,419
collection for a while I'm hoping gonna

2509
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:35,519
Bloom it this winter

2510
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:38,158
um that one you know Matt gave to me

2511
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,659
helpfully labeled original diesel yes

2512
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:41,819
yeah that's correct

2513
01:37:39,658 --> 01:37:43,138
I and I don't know any history behind it

2514
01:37:41,819 --> 01:37:45,119
by that some people call it the day

2515
01:37:43,139 --> 01:37:47,340
Wrecker

2516
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:49,979
um it's hard it's a hard one to trace

2517
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:52,020
back it really is I'm gonna grow it next

2518
01:37:49,979 --> 01:37:54,439
to my other diesel Family Cuts and see

2519
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:54,440
what I think

2520
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:57,840
um it certainly grows a little

2521
01:37:55,738 --> 01:38:00,119
differently

2522
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,920
um it's a little bushier to me and I

2523
01:38:00,119 --> 01:38:03,840
think I think pip would pip agrees on

2524
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,980
this one it's one of the more potent of

2525
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,199
the diesel families one of the most

2526
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:09,718
potent like it is it is for us it's it

2527
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:12,238
is narcotic as [ __ ] it's a little strong

2528
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:14,219
it's a little strong

2529
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:15,599
um I would say it it draws a little

2530
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:17,939
after the end

2531
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,620
yeah that draws from that afghanian very

2532
01:38:17,939 --> 01:38:21,419
heavily how many in the high how many

2533
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:23,340
days does it make I mean I know pip

2534
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:24,179
would say 84 but how many days would you

2535
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:28,079
take it

2536
01:38:24,179 --> 01:38:30,060
yes 70 77 right in between there 11

2537
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:34,260
weeks right in that same range

2538
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:36,179
yeah right in that same range so yeah no

2539
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:40,280
that's one that's a great reader too

2540
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:40,279
it's a great breeder yeah

2541
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:46,319
I think not just catching a lag it's a

2542
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:47,939
bunch of cool discussions going on I

2543
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:50,158
might

2544
01:38:47,939 --> 01:38:53,759
yeah

2545
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:55,920
am I here you go you're back

2546
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,020
oh man

2547
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:00,658
I'm back there's a bunch of cool

2548
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:04,199
comments uh about nutrition I've thought

2549
01:39:00,658 --> 01:39:06,658
about doing like a solo show recording

2550
01:39:04,198 --> 01:39:08,579
about ju about like uh about nutrition

2551
01:39:06,658 --> 01:39:10,019
for a while I just haven't actually

2552
01:39:08,579 --> 01:39:11,279
pulled it together

2553
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:13,920
um but it's like to me it's like a

2554
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,539
fascinating topic because I've grown uh

2555
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:17,039
for at different points in my career

2556
01:39:15,539 --> 01:39:20,100
I've grown

2557
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:22,319
um the exact same strain side by side uh

2558
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,760
under same same everything but feeding

2559
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:27,238
them different what do you guys think

2560
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:28,320
about a a not so Story Hour show too I

2561
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:30,119
think it's a good I've been trying to

2562
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:33,179
push him to do it because he's he's very

2563
01:39:30,119 --> 01:39:35,219
good like in audiobook voice like with

2564
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:37,199
not being interrupted by me saying yeah

2565
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:39,480
all the time and I know people get

2566
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:41,039
annoyed by that but we're trying to you

2567
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:44,218
know continue the conversation and make

2568
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:48,179
it not you know but I I'm looking

2569
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:50,219
forward to it so prod and poking it's uh

2570
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:52,679
it's my it's my fault I should have done

2571
01:39:50,219 --> 01:39:54,480
it but uh I haven't done it yet he'll

2572
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:58,199
get to it I mean I could say that but

2573
01:39:54,479 --> 01:40:01,559
but nutrition is something that is uh

2574
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:03,719
it affects sour and Diesel cuts a bunch

2575
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:05,639
yeah and it affects a lot of strains a

2576
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:07,800
bunch and it's one of those things where

2577
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:10,380
it's the closest thing to religion that

2578
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,460
weed growers get where they're convinced

2579
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:13,440
that whatever they're using whatever

2580
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:16,198
they're feeding especially organic and K

2581
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:18,779
F and living soil types that they have

2582
01:40:16,198 --> 01:40:21,719
stumbled upon the word of God absolutely

2583
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:23,279
and so if you try to talk to them about

2584
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:25,920
what you've what you've experienced

2585
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:27,479
sometimes it can be here it can be

2586
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,639
you know I mean they can't burn you at

2587
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:31,619
the stake but they might want to they

2588
01:40:29,639 --> 01:40:33,359
definitely will want to that's for sure

2589
01:40:31,619 --> 01:40:34,679
yeah there could be some Salem Witch

2590
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:37,559
Trials or something like that because

2591
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:40,859
you know there's I think salts get a bad

2592
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:44,340
name uh in certain regards and I think

2593
01:40:40,859 --> 01:40:46,859
Organics you know is poorly understood

2594
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:49,560
in a lot of ways I'm not going to hijack

2595
01:40:46,859 --> 01:40:51,420
the whole show but it is it is

2596
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,840
interesting more much more so than

2597
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:57,300
almost any strain I've grown or any or

2598
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:59,279
any family of strains that I've grown if

2599
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,779
you start playing around with food and

2600
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,420
light spectrum

2601
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:06,599
you will get way different results with

2602
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:08,940
diesels yeah definitely

2603
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,320
you know you really will like I've grown

2604
01:41:08,939 --> 01:41:12,119
I you know I've grown them under

2605
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:13,920
different light spectrums metal halides

2606
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:16,500
high pressure sodiums double-ended

2607
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:20,819
Ceramics you start changing the food

2608
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:22,260
that's something that really responds to

2609
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:23,759
changes

2610
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:25,320
and that's what makes it so hard to

2611
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:27,600
identify too

2612
01:41:25,319 --> 01:41:30,059
under uh ceramic metal halides I

2613
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:32,820
remember it almost had like a a more

2614
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:36,780
cushy type bun it wasn't foxtaily it

2615
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:39,000
looked almost delicate small cushy it

2616
01:41:36,779 --> 01:41:40,319
was really weird for a sour the ecsd cut

2617
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
choco

2618
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:43,880
people somebody was just saying in the

2619
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,439
comments all just the bottles are poison

2620
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:48,900
uh that's a bunch of [ __ ]

2621
01:41:46,439 --> 01:41:51,419
um you know uh bottles are just uh

2622
01:41:48,899 --> 01:41:54,479
bottles are just a form to hold a liquid

2623
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:56,880
right uh yeah and you know in if you get

2624
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:58,618
like a really high quality hydroponic

2625
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,719
nutrient right

2626
01:41:58,618 --> 01:42:04,019
um especially one that's made out of

2627
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:07,439
high quality minerals those minerals are

2628
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:10,860
just pure forms of like the what the

2629
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:13,319
plant needs you know uh salts get a bad

2630
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:15,179
name because cheap salts have heavy

2631
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:16,738
metals and have other [ __ ] and are

2632
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:19,380
derived from things that aren't that

2633
01:42:16,738 --> 01:42:22,379
nice yeah but really really high grade

2634
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:24,239
salts it's literally just like you know

2635
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:25,739
it's there's minerals that the plants

2636
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:27,000
are absorbing and they have them in this

2637
01:42:25,738 --> 01:42:30,799
order and they get them from a really

2638
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:33,779
clean source and there you go

2639
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:36,360
it looks like we made it an hour and 45

2640
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:39,899
minutes in talking about diesel

2641
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:42,960
oh my God and it's lovely components

2642
01:42:39,899 --> 01:42:45,479
well there's also something so uh like I

2643
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:48,239
said in the beginning uh nice argument

2644
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:49,019
for your Thanksgiving weekend yeah you

2645
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:50,759
know

2646
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:51,780
people will probably hate me for saying

2647
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,639
certain things about this evening

2648
01:42:51,779 --> 01:42:56,039
tonight sometimes they say the most

2649
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:58,139
innocuous things about Diesel and I get

2650
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:00,238
hate mail

2651
01:42:58,139 --> 01:43:01,859
um because I poked a hole in somebody's

2652
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:03,299
story so it's not to tell anybody that

2653
01:43:01,859 --> 01:43:05,460
they're wrong it's just this is just our

2654
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:08,460
opinion yeah and not so there's always

2655
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:10,500
poking holes in someone so you know I
