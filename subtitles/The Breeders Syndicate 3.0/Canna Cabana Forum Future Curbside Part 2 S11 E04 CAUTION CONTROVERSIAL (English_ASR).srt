Revolution is in stock the blueberry in

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,000
cross that we've been working on for 5

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,759
years now is finally at its uh what I

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,280
feel is a great completion point for it

28
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,879
uh a true breeding line for blueberry

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,000
scents and

30
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,079
flavor um it was our most popular

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,879
selling line on the original release

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,118
when we released the first Blue Bonnet

33
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,798
crosses I didn't make a whole lot of

34
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:23,959
them because I really wanted to explore

35
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,880
what was in them before I did a major

36
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,199
release uh we were at that point and it

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:34,118
was uh originally a DJ Short Blueberry

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,520
from DJ shorts early early work where he

39
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,599
would sell the seeds at different talks

40
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,920
that he would do across California at

41
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,399
collectives uh buddy resin lung picked

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,280
up some packs he gave them to me I went

43
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,799
through them and found the best

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,799
representative of what I thought the

45
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,759
most beautiful blueberry was

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,280
like but it didn't have the exact scent

47
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,519
that I wanted when I saw that in my

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,239
mind's eye and I was as I would look at

49
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,399
it I would picture beautiful blueberry

50
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,599
jam tpps and flavor and scent just all

51
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:09,318
of it and they didn't have it so we made

52
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,239
a mission The Last 5 Years to make this

53
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,000
a reality and something where you could

54
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,159
pop a pack of seeds and it would be

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,759
almost identical for that tur profile

56
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,318
we're there they are now released on

57
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,519
Riot seeds.com the pre-orders over

58
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,839
they're already shipping out we also

59
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,400
have something called The Modern Blue um

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,000
that we didn't really release we did it

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,879
on our uh patreon so definitely check

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,639
that out our 50 tier patreon ended up

63
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:43,919
getting the Lion Share of these with

64
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:46,399
their monthly package and it was the mac

65
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,158
daddy cross to Blueberry incross Mac

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Daddy from a company called ouse

67
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:54,158
genetics and then my personal favorite

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,639
out of the uh hype strains as it were

69
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:58,399
that we are kind of uh merging with some

70
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,158
of this blue stuff so that we can bring

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
it into the modern generation and get

72
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:06,798
some of the new kids interested the

73
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:10,119
sherb cream pie phenomenally resinous

74
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,000
great hash maker great yielding nice

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,080
long high for a sherb cross which is my

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,799
biggest problem with Sher cross to our

77
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,560
blueberry in Cross and we call that one

78
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:23,439
blue cocky and um yeah triple on Tandra

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,640
there U we have bluy because it's Blast

80
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,400
for me to use something like runs for me

81
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,919
but the white runs out of all the runs

82
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,879
stuff I found to be the best runs cross

83
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,238
with the most potent High we did a

84
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,438
blueberry incross cross to that bringing

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
heavy heavy blueberry jam turps to the

86
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:42,039
white runs we also have trop Berry which

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,560
is the dosy trop uh Tropic trop Cherry I

88
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,359
believe cross to the dosy dose cross to

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,840
the blueberry and cross all of these are

00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,319
donate a bunch of seed amount of packs

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,560
yeah and uh I'm I'm going to get a bunch

107
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,319
of people to donate seeds and I'm going

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,399
to try and put together some packs that

109
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,079
are

110
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:42,239
like you know 10 packs or 20 packs or

111
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:46,959
you know give them the supply that we

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:51,319
can get uh but then sell them uh for

113
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:56,680
like 50 bucks 100 bucks

114
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,680
to uh members of the Cabana that

115
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,439
way good genetics are getting out there

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,680
they're at an affordable price

117
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:10,399
um I know these days I

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,319
see go a lot of people that don't want

119
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:18,198
to spend money on genetics yeah and

120
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,918
um that that upsets me because I come

121
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,600
from a place where like you pay to play

122
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:28,240
yeah like you support your homies you

123
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,520
buy you buy things man and uh people

124
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,079
don't want to do that anymore and and

125
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,799
even when they do there's so many

126
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:40,359
options

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,319
that a, pack of beans like 10 years ago

128
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,080
a lot of people you know there were

129
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,000
there were a lot of us that were

130
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,478
interested in buying that oh these days

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,478
not you know so ain't happening Captain

132
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,758
not happening you know

133
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,519
no well I mean it's a clone culture now

134
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,919
I think there's a lot of fomo of people

135
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,240
thinking that they're going to go chase

136
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,240
that one this is an elite though but

137
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,319
they don't realize that Elite was

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,120
selected from two plants in some dude's

139
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,240
closet you know it's just one person's

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,680
opinion and there a lot of hype as

141
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,240
opposed to a bunch of real smokers

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,759
saying like I agree you agree we all

143
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,720
agree this is some [ __ ] day it's a

144
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,479
big difference now that in that sense

145
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
it's artificial hype versus a bunch of

146
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,199
people agreeing that this was actually

147
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,199
an

148
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,360
elite and it doesn't take much to

149
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,120
be proven an elite these days you know I

150
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,479
mean and no and there is a lot of good

151
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,000
weed out there I'm not hating on the

152
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,439
weed at all there's some good weed out

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,720
there but uh man weed's not hitting like

154
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,519
it used to I can no no I mean it can't

155
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,120
it's all cookies based man that [ __ ] has

156
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,519
a 10 minute 13 minute high and and it's

157
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,639
done and I mean no matter what you call

158
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,159
it cookie sh Lotto it all ends in the

159
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,598
same direction it's all dead end

160
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,000
breeding directions unless you outcross

161
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,560
and most of these people are crossing

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,360
inwards and inbreeding cookies and it

163
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,598
hasn't done it hasn't done anything

164
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,400
super beneficial for the breeding pool

165
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,478
out there it's Unique it's not unique I

166
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,719
mean there's no it's not unique and

167
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:19,240
everything uh you know all these Exotics

168
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
super finicky and the fact that they

169
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,439
call this [ __ ] Exotics blows my mind

170
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,318
like when we used to think EXO Exotics

171
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,759
it would be like nepes or you know some

172
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,080
wild Thai land race or you know what I

173
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,319
mean or some Mexican you hadn't heard of

174
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,758
but Exotics now means [ __ ] normal

175
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,960
[ __ ] you could buy from any Tom Dick

176
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,479
Stanley on Instagram pushing some purple

177
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,079
Frosty [ __ ] related to cookies in my

178
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,560
opinion it's just a trendy word just

179
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,359
being around to like hype up certain

180
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,680
strains I mean I think out of everything

181
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,120
that came from from the cookies

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,000
generation from all that you know like

183
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,800
obviously Skittles was an outlier I

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,959
remember when

185
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,639
Skittles year right

186
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,038
but it's ug but it's ugly and the first

187
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,478
thing when it won that cup you know I

188
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,759
remember um everybody was like oh we're

189
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,519
going to just cross it to gelato cookies

190
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,759
to whatever to make it

191
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,478
pretty again so all this stuff is just

192
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,158
like some percentage of gelato some

193
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:22,959
percentage of Skittles some percentage

194
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:25,038
of like the old cookie Cuts right yeah

195
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,878
and like like even runs is basically

196
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,519
just gelato S1 or whatever bag speed

197
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,080
right so like out of all

198
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,598
that what are the keepers gelato 3341

199
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,000
will probably always have a place on the

200
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,879
shelf right but yeah all all these poly

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,599
hybrids of it is they're not really

202
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,278
bringing anything bad new or different

203
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,360
some of them are a little fruer some of

204
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,039
them are a little gasier but it's like

205
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,399
it's just in there you know and at the

206
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:51,599
end of the day like I've been out with

207
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,679
homies and c and we go we smoke a bunch

208
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,560
of joints and the old 33 cut still cuts

209
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,000
through everything else in flavor so

210
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,759
like yeah everything else is just

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,839
watered down versions of that it's the

212
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,720
same thing like now people want the

213
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,560
original Skittles all of a sudden again

214
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,040
like we went back to where we were seven

215
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,679
years ago can't keep the clone of that

216
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,360
piece of [ __ ] Le it everybody lost it

217
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,599
yeah I've heard people just recently

218
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,240
paying like 400 bucks an ounce for for

219
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:22,159
an ounce and it just goes to show that

220
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,680
right now TPS are King because no grower

221
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,159
is gonna be like oh man I want to grow

222
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,159
Skittles Fu no especially if they've

223
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,679
grown real Skittles then they know they

224
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,000
don't want to grow Skittles

225
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,319
you but that's the only thing I think

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,879
new that came out of a lot of this right

227
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,640
yeah um you know yeah the motor breath

228
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,360
got crossed out to a bunch of stuff a

229
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,000
couple but otherwise like anybody that's

230
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,480
doing new anything interesting in

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,078
breeding has been like digging back into

232
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,159
you know other things or like land races

233
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:54,159
have been like you know everyone's thing

234
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,078
and I think a lot people claiming land

235
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,199
race crosses when they're not really

236
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,838
that or you know you could you could

237
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,040
take any bags you it was a land race

238
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,360
yeah I found it I found it on the ground

239
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,480
at a show so it must be a land race yeah

240
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,480
I got this in Thailand from [ __ ]

241
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,879
cookie fam and it's in their bag so we

242
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,560
got a Thailand race but I I do think we

243
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,399
need to evolve from where we are right

244
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,879
now I mean just just anecdotally about a

245
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,000
year ago uh in March of last year I got

246
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,879
to go to Morocco and I toured a bunch of

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,679
hash Farms there oh wow and that was a

248
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,240
super super dope experience right um and

249
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,838
and but even there as soon as I got

250
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,278
there like I got these Moroccan guys

251
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,600
they're like do you have the RS you

252
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:40,720
know and I'm like of course bro they're

253
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,399
not they're growing modern lines in

254
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,000
Morocco now DNA started doing all 90s

255
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,200
like in the that I could I could tell

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
you the whole DNA story I got the inside

257
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,560
scoop on what they did there when I was

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,278
there but but well I'll just say first

259
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,119
um you know in the last five years the

260
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,720
American genetics have really blown up

261
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,120
there like everywhere right Spain Europe

262
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,000
you know people want to grow all the

263
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,720
American cups now the Dutch sh been over

264
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,919
um but what happened in Morocco nobody's

265
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,839
growing landr stuff and so everyone

266
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,838
started getting all these new problems

267
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,639
like

268
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,959
cherium H potery mildew because the

269
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,120
strains they've been growing for the

270
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:22,518
last like thousand years are acclimated

271
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,200
to their soil to their climate and now

272
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,519
they're having like like they're like I

273
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,399
don't know why I'm getting this like

274
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,799
stem rot like they're they're getting

275
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,120
all thiser like losing whole plants that

276
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,439
would be like multi- pound plants you

277
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,759
know so um from what I understand with

278
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,600
DNA what happened there was was uh you

279
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,000
know through through Crockett and those

280
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,720
guys when the Tangi really blew up they

281
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,360
went there and a lot of Moroccan farmers

282
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,320
are pretty rudimentary and it goes back

283
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,039
to those orange Citrus turps like that

284
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,160
really represents really well there and

285
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:00,360
cuts through in the hash so everybody

286
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:02,799
was like just went crazy crazy for Tangi

287
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,120
turbs down there and like bombed Europe

288
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,799
with Tangi hash and and the farmers were

289
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,720
really successful from it right um but

290
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:15,359
then in subsequent years DNA went back

291
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,360
there and tried to sell like T f2s or

292
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,039
whatever the followup lines of and they

293
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,440
couldn't find that same percentage of

294
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,039
like that Tangy Orange feno in there and

295
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,920
a lot of the hash they were producing

296
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,958
was like bunk and you had like dirt dirt

297
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,879
po Moroccan farmers in the mountains

298
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,278
that couldn't sell their hash that like

299
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,159
couldn't feed their kids end up

300
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,799
committing suicide like people want

301
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,919
people wanted to rip their heads off

302
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,278
there because they real world real world

303
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:47,198
[ __ ] happened yeah they just went there

304
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,039
and sold like millions of seeds and just

305
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:50,559
profiteering and just didn't give a [ __ ]

306
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,838
about the farmers or the people at the

307
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,559
end of the day or destroying the land

308
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,560
races that were there yeah which

309
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,119
unfortunately unless you go really deep

310
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,799
in the mountains like um um it it's

311
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,440
nobody's really grow none of the younger

312
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:09,359
guys so lucky yeah I saw I saw gushers I

313
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,240
saw you know I saw all the Breeders that

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,680
we've been talking about today you know

315
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,639
cookies disappointed I would be if I

316
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,599
pulled up to Morocco and they're like

317
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,959
look at my field of gushers yeah right

318
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,480
yeah oh bro yeah it was it was

319
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,679
disappointing for me because I you I

320
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,159
mean also I mean when I was 14 I got to

321
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,919
spend the summer uh summer in Spain I

322
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,639
was smoking hash there and it was all

323
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,679
Moroccan hash and it all had that like

324
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,159
you know Church incent like really

325
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,759
ethnic kind of unique flavor that is

326
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,519
rare you know like this turb profile

327
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,679
that just doesn't really exist anymore

328
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,959
you know so everything now is like it's

329
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:54,679
just a faint version of all the cookies

330
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:57,078
gelato you know Skittle stuff we're just

331
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,638
talking about or they're going Citrus

332
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,359
because like you can't really lose with

333
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,399
citrus chps and half yeah and and that's

334
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,600
all that they're producing anymore you

335
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,639
know and it's all like Italian and

336
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,320
French like Mafia guys controlling it

337
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,198
down there the Moroccan farmers are just

338
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,800
like dirt poor trying to get their hands

339
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,719
on se you know it's a it's a it's a

340
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,879
crazy scene it's interesting I have I

341
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,800
have this conversation with a lot of the

342
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,639
the kids that have been maybe coming in

343
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,479
the last 10 years and wanting to really

344
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,320
get into land races and trying to

345
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,360
explain to them dude like you're going

346
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,839
to have a really hard time um not

347
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,680
because you they don't necessarily know

348
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,440
what the land races would look like as

349
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,879
as much as I wouldn't I've never been

350
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,040
over there but I do know who has been

351
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,519
over there and how often they sell seeds

352
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,639
and the amount of seeds that they sell

353
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,679
over there each year in Morocco and how

354
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,399
those get distributed to Afghanistan and

355
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,638
all the other places and trying to

356
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,879
explain to them probably you're a little

357
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,240
bit late to the party to be able to

358
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,439
discern what's over there and they just

359
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,759
absolutely hate hearing that like it's

360
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,160
like you have just you're wrong you

361
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,000
don't what you're talking about and it's

362
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,439
like no really this is what's happened

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,440
over there and it's unfortunate but but

364
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,720
we all miss the boat like essentially

365
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,519
yeah it's a bummer you really have to

366
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,160
get tied in with the right people to

367
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,959
find something that's really been

368
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:20,159
preserved and you know people have asked

369
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,078
me like I I got some some buddies in

370
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,159
Greece that have been able to you know

371
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,679
link with like an old legendary grower

372
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,399
in the mountains there and they've been

373
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,958
able to collect five land race Greek

374
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,720
genetics including the famous calamada

375
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,919
red yeah yeah um and they've had it

376
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,040
genetically tested with like the whole

377
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,360
phos or whatever it is medicinal

378
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,198
genomics

379
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,600
Galaxy medicinal genomics over phos for

380
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:46,399
sure so yeah well I think it's the same

381
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,720
company now they they one became the

382
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,240
next one right no that's horable but uh

383
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,319
but basically it's a genetic outlier

384
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,120
it's Unique and you know they've asked

385
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:59,439
me like what should we do with the seeds

386
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,159
and they want to outcross it to cook and

387
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,240
all the and I'm like I'm like the first

388
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:05,078
thing you do if you get a hold of seeds

389
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,198
from somewhere where it's not legal yet

390
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:08,719
that you know our land race is like just

391
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,359
do a huge

392
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,560
F2 yeah

393
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,759
yeah that [ __ ] open pollinate make like

394
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,559
a thousands more of those seeds and give

395
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,639
them out to people so that shit's out

396
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:23,198
there you know if you even if you're

397
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,480
trying to like protect it and not let it

398
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,318
completely get out there you still got

399
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,199
to give it to some homies and trust it

400
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:31,519
because like because so many things have

401
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:33,719
been lost over the years because it's

402
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,679
still

403
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,120
here and do it right you know if the the

404
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,159
real Seed Co I know they sell a calamada

405
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,879
red from Greece I wonder if that's

406
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,759
sourced from

407
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,039
them I don't

408
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,480
know let you know because I have some

409
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,439
here but like you know they're expensive

410
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,920
as [ __ ] even on the real Seed Co but

411
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,440
like to get like old heirloom Greek

412
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,120
seeds would be really [ __ ] cool so I

413
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,079
rolled the dice I haven't popped them

414
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,360
because I just don't no for sure from

415
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,240
from what I understand about it is like

416
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,558
it actually has a really awesome unique

417
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,078
chir profile um it has like really nice

418
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,439
colors that Express from it but it's

419
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:17,000
just you know old school spear shaped

420
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,199
fluffy buds not the the flower density

421
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,400
that the market wants you know that's

422
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,199
why people wanted to outcross it

423
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,400
basically yeah I've cross this to

424
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,079
cookies the first thing that that just

425
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,480
bastardized yeah a dead end breeding

426
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,639
yeah

427
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,839
yeah it needs something like old ciny

428
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,160
hash plant or old Afghani one or

429
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:38,639
something like that you know what I mean

430
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,880
to bring in some of that and keep the

431
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,200
diversity without bastardizing it with a

432
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,160
PO Hy [ __ ] mess that's not gonna

433
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,798
really dominate the tur profile that's

434
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,400
going that tur profile Express itself

435
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,160
but that's that's the problem with a lot

436
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,679
of these land races when they're bred

437
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,080
for just outdoor growing you bring them

438
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,919
inside they're going to have longer

439
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,359
flower times and everybody all these

440
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,840
commercial facilities

441
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,519
chop at eight weeks so that's just the

442
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,000
weed that we have now you know it's

443
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,558
going to Herm a lot of it's going to

444
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,839
Herm like bringing outdoor to in usually

445
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:12,720
has Herm issues at the jump and you have

446
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,959
to acclimate it select do all this [ __ ]

447
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,759
A lot of people don't want to put in the

448
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,200
time because it's got to be bang bang

449
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,480
bang something new each month you need a

450
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,919
new drop each month of a hundred strains

451
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,919
to keep your [ __ ] going you know

452
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,080
yeah it's a different scene bro

453
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,360
different scene braidings the art of

454
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,879
braidings really kind of uh been lost

455
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,879
like me and CSI talk about it a lot like

456
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,039
when releasing new lines like if we put

457
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,720
these out to be tested if we take the

458
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,919
time to test these seeds now what does

459
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,558
that mean because other people going to

460
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,759
be releasing six different drops and

461
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:50,639
they're going to see we're releasing

462
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:53,798
this and working on it and just say they

463
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,400
have it release it and then while we're

464
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:58,839
over here testing it and doing the real

465
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,400
work it's already been done like the the

466
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:02,720
idea of it's been out there and done so

467
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,600
now what we've done even though it's

468
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,679
real is no longer

469
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:10,199
relevant it's it's a real bad kind of

470
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,798
black hole getting worse and worse and

471
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,159
worse

472
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:16,240
the the seed companies have really

473
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:22,480
painted themselves into a corner with

474
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:24,159
this no testing [ __ ] and yeah it's

475
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,919
uh

476
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,080
that's I think that's one of the biggest

477
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,038
downfalls to seeds these days is there's

478
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:34,199
a lot of greed in it and it's so much

479
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:37,599
the rush to the market the rush to be

480
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,880
first the rush to beat everybody as

481
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,558
opposed

482
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,280
to taking the time to do something

483
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:47,519
properly and right is uh painfully

484
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,720
apparent with the offerings that are

485
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,720
available out on the market these days

486
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,279
but uh there's a few people I'm I'm

487
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,038
interested to know I want to know who

488
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,918
everybody's favorite breeders are these

489
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:01,480

00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:05,120
Okie where you

491
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,599

Chris man that's hard to say I was going

499
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:33,879
to say Bloom Co probably too because

500
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:36,279
he's kind of a homie and uh you know um

501
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,640
I've grown a lot of his stuff over the

502
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:44,079
last couple years but um you know it's

503
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:46,600
hard to say because uh um nothing has

504
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,319
been too impressive to me lately that

505
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,879
I've had to grow I deal with a lot of

506
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,720
commercial facilities so you know I'm

507
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,320

nothing really punches through for me

510
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:06,678
you know now so um yeah I'm I'm uh uh

511
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,120

pollen's going to take differently

602
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:29,119
plants reverse differently and the

603
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:32,839
genetics align differently

604
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:36,158
exactly and I love being able

even hate on these days man cuz I'm a

669
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,600
hater by

670
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,839
uh I just naturally go to hate you know

671
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,319
some of these guys are putting in work

672
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:43,599
and just because I'm old and I don't

673
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,960
know I feel the same way dude yeah doing

674
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,639
it you know I agree I agree I'm just

675
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,319
Clowning over here but you know I mean I

676
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,519
feel like even in the old old days like

677
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,000
we always had a breeder or somebody that

678
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:58,640
was like the butt of the jokes right

679
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,640
like back in the day me like

680
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,960
like me and red dog were at each other's

681
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,640
throats all the time like a year and a

682
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,319
half you know or like it was cool to

683
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,720
make fun of subcool you know yeah well

684
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:15,278
that was easy to do yeah yeah so um but

685
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,120
you know every like I mean even a broken

686
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,960
clock is right twice a day right and uh

687
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,199
and sometimes you got to give the plants

688
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,120
credit and what they're capable of over

689
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,360
the humans that just interacted with

690
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,199
them because this plant just has this

691
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,839
amazing ability to you know produce

692
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
these tur profiles so like sometimes a

693
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,038
breeder that's just even fumbling around

694
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,079
will stumble across something that's

695
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,919
fire and of course they're going to you

696
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,918
know adhere it to their ego and make it

697
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,360
about them but it's like the plant has

698
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,720
that ability sometimes to like just you

699
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:48,119
find a diamond in the rof and and and

700
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,200
that's nothing against any of the new

701
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,759
breeders but like you know you can get

702
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,000
really lucky when you're working with

703
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:57,200
good parent genetics you know like the

704
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,240
example I've always given is like if

705
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,399
both your your parents are are

706
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,519
professional tennis player you're

707
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:05,278
probably going to be pretty good at

708
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,798
tennis exactly right so like like we had

709
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,240
we had to work with just like you know

710
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:10,918
in the in the early days like we were

711
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,240
just working with Dutch genetics and

712
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,080
whatever like you know Mexican bag seed

713
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,359
we could find and we had to dig harder

714
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:22,000
it was more work to find something like

715
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:23,558
truly noteworthy and memorable and uh

716
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,359
you know and now it's like there's so

717
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:28,000
much out there between other people's

718
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,798
seeds clone only genetic like you can

719
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,119
just grab something and start Crossing

720
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:34,480
and playing around and stumble across

721
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:36,639
something maybe not unique but but

722
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,519
definitely fire you know definitely a

723
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,519
big shot at finding hlv if you're

724
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,640
playing with [ __ ] clones nowadays you

725
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:45,519
know what I mean the availability of

726
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,399
everything too like back in the day

727
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,599
there

728
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,038
was three or four seed websites that

729
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:55,398
were actually like legit that I trusted

730
00:30:52,038 --> 00:31:00,720
that I would order from now

731

732
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,679

Lonesome is one of my other favorite

852
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,920
breeders and and not just because of his

853
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:23,800
breeding but like as a human he's made

854
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,838
me be a better human uh as we become

855
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,760
friends like he has a moral code that

856
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:32,279
like really is almost second to none as

857
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,280
far as like how you treat people how you

858
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,519
treat your customers how you hold

859
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,000
yourself as a man those are the kind of

860
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:41,358

Charm from still too big like great OG

974
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,879
whatever happened to the abusive

975
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,640
ogos some people are floating that one

976
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,480
around again I don't know I'm skeptical

977
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,960
when I hear that people got Abus of OG

978
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,920
again but I'd like to see it if it is

979
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,079
Shor Line's back around though the old

980
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,680
Shoreline Cuts back around heard that

981
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,519
still cool yeah I mean I mean the chems

982
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,639
I think always kind of stayed around I

983
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,759
mean you know that was that was uh the

984
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:49,078
chem stayed around but we all rocked

985
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,079
chem 4 pretty freaking

986
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:59,240
yeah ran nothing but cam 4 for a long

987
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:03,480
time you guys ever get to run D too I've

988
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:05,559
never ran chem one I I saw uh inspectors

989
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,199
doing some work with it

990
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:10,318
and I'd be interested to see what that's

991
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:12,879
all about what's it what's the closest

992
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:16,440
comparison to Super Silver [ __ ] Haze

993
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,200
bro what nl5 it's an nl5 Haze dominant

994
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,159
cut and that's when we were able to

995
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:23,838
realize okay [ __ ] now we know

996
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:27,279
chem4 wasn't just a bag seat of the same

997
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:29,799
thing this is obviously an nl5 Haze cut

998
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,160
that's almost all mercing and it's it's

999
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,200
very obvious and had a lot of yeah

1000
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,399
there's a little tealing terpinolene in

1001
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:38,719
there you know what I mean like it's got

1002
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,519
all the traits at nl5 Haze and it's very

1003
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,959
strong very strong breed true breed's

1004
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:48,358
true for 5% plus tpin though for of

1005
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,199
mercing which is is special in its own

1006
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:54,279
right yeah yeah

1007
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:57,679
yeah see and it's like only somebody

1008
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,839
like inspecta could come up with

1009
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,078
Kem one yeah he kept it ever since Joe

1010
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:06,318
BR

1011
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:09,519
gave you don't let go of nothing yeah I

1012
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:14,960
uh I mean there was a point where I

1013
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:17,559
probably had 80 moms in my

1014
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,920
uh yeah in my basement in my little

1015
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,519
condo and I remember

1016
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,000
uh my neighbors called and snitched me

1017
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:28,599
out and I ended up getting raided and uh

1018
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,800
of course I called like all the Cabana

1019
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,039
guys I was like man everybody come to my

1020
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,079
house we got to break everything down

1021
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:40,358
right now cop gave me 48 hours before

1022
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,519
they came back and uh so I remember

1023
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:45,920
everybody was over there I think you

1024
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:48,239
know it was a free-for-all bro it was a

1025
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,318
free-for-all and uh that was one of

1026
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:54,558
those things where I I had caregiver

1027
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:57,318
cards from yeah oh yeah of each person

1028
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:59,200
Yeah Yeah from patience man so cop

1029
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:00,920
showed up and they were just so confused

1030
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,719
they're like is I don't they don't know

1031
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,800
what to doal or illegal like they didn't

1032
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:10,358
want to mess with nothing but they knew

1033
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,599
uh they ended up getting me on building

1034
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:15,480
violations because I didn't pull permits

1035
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:18,160
to do like my electrical upgrades and

1036
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,199
things like that man hey did any of you

1037
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,719
guys ever come across freefor all the

1038
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:26,399
Clone no I've never even heard of it no

1039
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,558
never grew it that was uh Mr Nice oh was

1040
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,720
it on Mr nice that FFA was being passed

1041
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,240
around yeah I think they were the on I

1042
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,078
was confusing it was Cabana because it

1043
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:37,719
was a um Mass Super Skunk cross to

1044
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,160
something and I can't remember what the

1045
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,039
second part was maybe Woody cush or

1046
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,318
something weird I always I always

1047
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:46,239
thought it was Cabana but maybe it was

1048
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:47,599
Mr Nice or FFA was but but it was funny

1049
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:48,879
because it was called freefor all

1050
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,440
because it's supposed to be free for

1051
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,079
everyone to grow and it got immediately

1052
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,800
locked you know one of those

1053
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:01,480
situations Chris had probably the best

1054
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,960
Sour Diesel cut of all of us he had the

1055
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,880
E sure where' you where' you source that

1056
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,400
ecsd Chris that was the one I gave to

1057
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,400
Harry Palms that he used in all his sour

1058
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,358
crosses for for Bloom Co for

1059
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:20,680
everything so I originally when I first

1060
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:22,558
got to Denver in 2009 I got it at uh cam

1061
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:27,000
from

1062
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:29,960
ANC was it the choco cut or ecsd choco

1063
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,559
was it that one no honestly I think it

1064
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:38,358
was a pheno from re's uh soury uh

1065
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:40,559
3.0 which um was pretty representative I

1066
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:42,318
mean you know over the years I I grew

1067
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:47,200
the hell out of that cut I felt like I

1068
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:49,838
perfected it and um people people passed

1069
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:53,318
me the AJ cut people passed me some like

1070
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:55,480
fish tour ecsd cut people passed me like

1071
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:57,440
four or five other sour diesels and

1072
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,280
nothing stood up to this one

1073
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,400
so you know once again I'm not going to

1074
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,519
like you know based on the breeder or or

1075
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,480
whatever but like that that [ __ ] was the

1076
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:10,039
truth that was a really fire Sour Diesel

1077
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,838
cut yeah dude it can happen you know

1078
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:14,279
like I said Harry Harry Palm's been

1079
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,639
breeding with it and um you know I

1080
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,359
passed that to a lot of people there's

1081
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,719
one um that came out of Colorado maybe

1082
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:25,318
not out of Colorado but was passed by

1083
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,719
you guys know Stacy J Mir yeah yeah yeah

1084
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:29,000
of course he was the one who passed it

1085
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,439
to to uh it made its way to Caleb and

1086
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,199
that's the one the CSI uses today that's

1087
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,519
sour that one's

1088
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:39,519
[ __ ] Mir used to come to a bunch of

1089

1101
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,800
another cool thing about the Cabana

1102
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:12,719
maybe you know differently Matt and I

1103
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,920
was just mistaken but uh knucklehead

1104
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:19,519
just posted up that he spoke to luran

1105
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,159
the other day and he's cancer free and I

1106
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:26,119
was under the impression that lauran had

1107
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:29,759
passed away in December yeah but no

1108
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:32,960
lauran is alive and well that's [ __ ]

1109
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,040
rad yeah you that's good news that's

1110
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,280
great news is good news and that's the

1111
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,880
type of things that you can just

1112
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,839
randomly learn over on the Cabana you

1113
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,318
know I remember uh because we got all

1114
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:47,880
the old guys who actually talk to luran

1115
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,679
still yeah you know I remember uh Chima

1116
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,240
posted at one point that Tom Hill had

1117
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,279
died killed himself and I remember

1118
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,118
eulogizing Tom Hill and [ __ ] and then

1119

00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,680
one specific thread that in the Tom Hill

1132
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,440
Forum like that 10 pound plant outdoor

1133
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,239
thread I had like this a wealth of

1134
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,079
knowledge like like probably a third of

1135
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:40,598
what I've learned total about outdoor

1136
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:44,240
growing came from

1137
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:46,760
that Tom Hill Hayes times everything man

1138
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,919
I support I'd hit that to everything you

1139
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,160
know yeah dude and he just recently did

1140
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,440
a Repro or had someone do a Repro of the

1141
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,598
top Hill say so there's more of it back

1142
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,599
out there I don't know how good the

1143
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,039
selection is but yeah that's the hard

1144
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,838
part when people try and bring back the

1145
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:05,639
old school genetics like man mother you

1146
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:08,239
know parental stock is different and all

1147
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,318
I don't know I feel something about old

1148
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,719
school seeds I don't know climate change

1149
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,440
or something they were better back in

1150
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:16,279
the day I mean Phil Phil's he did a big

1151
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,119
pop of it right to pick pick the one

1152
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,798
that he

1153
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,280
did I'm sure he did I couldn't tell you

1154
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:24,920
the exact he had a really good selection

1155
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:29,079
and in Tom Hills Hayes as much as I love

1156
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:33,000
Tom Hill that [ __ ] was grass carrots and

1157
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:34,720
hay 99% of it that I saw oh 100% of what

1158
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,960
I saw but I know there's good [ __ ] in

1159
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,159
there because I've seen other people

1160
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,280
come across it and what I saw come from

1161
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:42,879
[ __ ] was fire absolute fire so I think

1162
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,599
you did a good job hay is one of those

1163
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,400
things that you got to do uh bigger

1164
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:53,880
numbers in Man 10 pack isn't gonna do uh

1165
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,440
you for it he had said it back then I

1166
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,000
mean that's why he only had like a

1167
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,599
couple genetics as a breeder you know on

1168
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,199
IC mag that those were all preservation

1169
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,760
runs he wasn't like you know he wasn't

1170
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,960
trying to breed for any specific trait

1171
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,680
he was just like here's the whole hodge

1172
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:13,720
podge of Hayes DNA smashed together for

1173
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:16,480
you to keep smashing together and keep

1174
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:18,118
finding things for eternity you know so

1175
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,159
that's really what he did so it's all

1176
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,640
locked and hidden in there it's not

1177
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,199
going to be like a 10 pack from any

1178
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,759
other breeder where you might find a

1179
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:28,239
winner in 10 or 20 seeds yeah he was

1180
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,280
always really open that it would be like

1181
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:35,118
10% Keepers 90% move and and for a long

1182
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,200
time he sold them cheaper you'd even get

1183
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,440
freebies on seed Bay and like you'd be

1184
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:42,318
like more hayze seeds I'll never grow

1185
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,679
these and and now everybody wants them

1186
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,798
it's funny how everything like Goes

1187
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,440
Around in Circles like that even worse

1188
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,119
was the Sam the skunk Man Tai skunk Haze

1189
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,880
dude how many people got 990,000 packs

1190
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,160
of those yeah I think I still have some

1191
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,318
of those somewhere the thunk or whatever

1192
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:03,039
it's called yeah I ran some reeferman

1193
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:08,558
original Haze and that [ __ ] went for

1194
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:10,960
like 17 weeks bro [ __ ] weer man bro

1195
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:15,359
yeah doesn't even start showing pistols

1196
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,358
till like week five or something

1197
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:19,920
yeah that's the other thing man so many

1198
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,240
breeders

1199
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,599
like you get their gear and then they

1200
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,118
end up doing something and you feel like

1201
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,039
you feel like uh you're on the Epstein

1202
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,920
list or something could you got a pack

1203
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,920
he definitely got he definitely got on

1204
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,639
that list bro he he uh he split up me

1205
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,798
and Neville me and Neville were doing a

1206
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:40,440
project and for me that was like a once

1207
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:42,199
in a-lifetime thing to be able to work

1208
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,039
with Neville the guy who started it all

1209
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:46,639
right and uh reeferman was playing real

1210
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,159
cool with me and having Neville like

1211
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,159
Source stuff for me making promises like

1212
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:52,480
oh yeah you get this from him I'll send

1213
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:54,078
this and I was like dude he has a bad

1214
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,119
rep I ain't sending him [ __ ] and I was

1215
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,960
like I got it man if he [ __ ] you I I'll

1216
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,640
cover it and then reeferman slowly

1217
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,760
started telling Neville yeah if you work

1218
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:05,519
with Matt you're going to look poor

1219
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,880
you're G to look like a poor person

1220
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,400
because he's not he's not like not well

1221
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,240
loved sure enough split it down the

1222
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,000
middle me and Neville never finished the

1223
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,318
projects in the end he used some of the

1224
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,159
stuff but we didn't do it together you

1225
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,960
know past that six months and then

1226
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:21,358
reeferman ripped him off and bailed you

1227
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,639
know it's just like one of those things

1228
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,519
where just I could can't change the

1229
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:28,078
stripes but there was some good [ __ ]

1230
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:30,798
[ __ ] in some of his [ __ ] you know like

1231
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,680
the the uh the butterscotch Hawaiian had

1232
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:34,480
some killer [ __ ] in it but then I find

1233
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:37,118
out that was made by scabby from White

1234
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,358
Buffalo you know what I

1235
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,280
mean wild smoking mirrors

1236
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:44,199
everywhere what do you feel about how do

1237
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,400
you feel about people white lab white

1238
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,558
labeling

1239
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,200
seeds you know I've done it for karma

1240
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,839
you know like that's when when me and

1241
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:54,439
Karma were friends I would I would make

1242
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,519
seeds for them let them white label them

1243
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,000
um I think it's a necessity for some

1244
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:02,280
breeders now and an only way for good

1245
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,280
breeders to make some money um I do have

1246
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,079
issues with the people who take those

1247
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,760
white label seeds and pretend to breed

1248
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:10,039
them and pretend that they're doing

1249
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,119
something they're not I don't really

1250
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:13,519
have a lot of respect for that I do

1251
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,000
realize that it's an important part of

1252
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,358
the industry and it's always going to be

1253
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,039
there but you know like walking around

1254
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,798
wearing lab coats pretending you're

1255
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:22,440
doing all this selection and pictures

1256
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:24,798
and stuff and then going and buying your

1257
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,519
seeds selling like I don't have a ton of

1258
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:30,358
respect for it but I realize it's

1259
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:34,079
necessary evil you know in other ways I

1260
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:37,078
don't fault the Breeders who do it

1261
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,318
like yeah exactly I mean it's always

1262
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,720
going to be there and I've done it like

1263
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:44,639
I'm just of G breeding for other people

1264
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,798
so that they could get like this great

1265
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,879
reputation of being breeders like Karma

1266
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:51,159
you know it's just how it

1267
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,798
goes normally I wouldn't even say their

1268
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:57,960
name you know there's plenty

1269
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:59,159
more but it is what it it is it's just

1270
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,280
it's something that most people don't

1271
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:04,039
know about most people don't know about

1272
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:08,359
it and don't understand how often it

1273
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:10,558
happens and it just is part of the

1274
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:13,719
game who who do you think are the best

1275
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:16,040
seed vendors These Days vendors or

1276
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:19,480
breeders

1277
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:23,358
vendors um there's there's only a few

1278
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:26,519
that I think really go for the the idea

1279
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:29,159
of of quality over quantity like there

1280
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:30,880
there are people that I I like is humans

1281
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:34,838
that run seed banks like I like James

1282
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,358
Bean as a human I hate about 90% of the

1283
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,400
people he carries because I know for a

1284
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:40,880
fact they're

1285
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,599
frauds um and you know and like he

1286
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,480
pushes that whole thing where it's like

1287
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:48,200
yeah I I vouch for everybody you know

1288
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,480
[ __ ] like that bothers me

1289
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:52,480
um you know there's there's good

1290
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,318
companies in Australia called Girt by

1291
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,039
seeds is a good one there's one here

1292
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:58,519
called lifted genetics that goes out of

1293
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,039
their way to make sure everybody they

1294
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:03,798
carry actually breeds does hard work all

1295
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:05,798
that stuff it's few and far between it's

1296
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:07,159
so few and far between of anybody who

1297
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:09,599
even knows what they're carrying most of

1298
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:11,558
the guys that Banks don't know [ __ ]

1299
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,680
about the genetics or selling or the

1300
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:16,200
people doing the quote unquote work yeah

1301
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:18,118
it's hard it's hard and that's why I

1302
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:21,239
think what you're G to do is g to be

1303
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:23,838
super [ __ ] important super

1304
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:27,719
[ __ ] I think people are like having

1305
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:30,358
access to things that are are smaller

1306
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:32,919
projects you know they're not meant for

1307
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:36,318
the masses they're they're meant

1308
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:39,280
for they're meant for Cabana members you

1309
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:41,480
know I have no respect for the attitude

1310
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,240
anything like that it's just another

1311
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,559
market for frauds to help frauds push

1312
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:49,318
their [ __ ] into seed resellers

1313
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:51,599
remarketing [ __ ] that isn't what they

1314
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:53,960
say it is that they're buying in bulk

1315
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,240
repackaging under their different always

1316
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,920
literally just I some times I'll check

1317
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:04,558
out the attitude just for shits and

1318
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:05,880
giggles and the list of breeders that I

1319
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,039
see on

1320
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:13,680
there and I'm always shocked at who I

1321
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:16,359
see on there and I'm always shocked at

1322
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:18,239
like who the [ __ ] is this dude yeah I

1323
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:21,400
have no idea

1324
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:24,439
who 80% of the Breeders and the attitude

1325
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,318
are these days you know yeah there was

1326
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,159

1328
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,798
day and having to giggle at because they

1329
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:33,359
were selling Miss Jill's stuff they were

1330
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:35,559
selling all these fake versions of

1331
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,719
everything they had a picture of uh what

1332
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:39,039
was it they were saying it was chem 91

1333
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:42,639
and you go look at it and it's straight

1334
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:44,880
cookies you know like sh like that and

1335

like dude you should know better just

1337
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,079

1338
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:55,599
should know that's not cam 91 is little

1339
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:56,798
inv got lost in their version of chem 91

1340
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,119
it's like

1341
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:01,519
and it even says chem 91 clone only and

1342
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,200
it's like that's [ __ ] cookies like

1343
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:06,440
yeah stop that's an chem 91's an ugly

1344
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:09,960
[ __ ] CL like

1345
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:12,358
that's yeah yeah it's it's hard it's

1346
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,400
hard because I get I get there's always

1347
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:16,798
going to be a need for that it's not

1348
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,599
anything I can do to make it go away but

1349
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,318
with this show I've done everything I

1350
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:23,079
can to break down the myths even if it

1351
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:25,759
ruins my reputation doing it and if I am

1352
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:27,920
the villain for doing it I'll never stop

1353
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,680
[ __ ] it I've gotten snitched on for

1354
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,920
doing what I do SWAT teams at my door

1355
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:35,798
for doing what I do and I don't give a

1356
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:38,920
[ __ ] I will keep doing it just because

1357
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:41,079
someone's someone's got to do it you

1358
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,880
know and I hopefully I'm right all the

1359
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:44,880
time maybe it's just my perspective too

1360
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,798
because I can't always be right but I

1361
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,280
try to get it as right as I can before I

1362
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:49,838
say it usually if I say something

1363
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,480
negative about someone it's someone that

1364
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:55,119
I've had Direct interaction and and know

1365
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,920
enough about them to say

1366
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:01,480
yeah

1367
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:05,680
well but you know it is what it

1368
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:08,639
is it's hard these days but uh over at

1369
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:10,318
the Cabana we're all pretty friendly and

1370
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,838
I'm pretty friendly over there too I try

1371
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,599
to I try to like keep that part I try to

1372
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:17,400
keep that kind of [ __ ] to my own show

1373
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:20,039
and my own space you're a whole new mat

1374
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,358
these days man I try I try to be a

1375
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:22,359
little

1376
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:28,358
nicer uh that's the hardest part for me

1377
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,519
too is I try and be nicer too because

1378
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:34,119
Oki and Chris will tell

1379
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:37,480
you I mean I'm a nice guy but I'm also

1380
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:40,000
[ __ ] so yeah I can't snap out of

1381
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,719
[ __ ] I've seen curb handle some

1382
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,358
negative uh interactions on the Cabana

1383
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,598
recently and I'm reading what he says

1384
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:49,199
and I'm like like bro this is like the

1385
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:52,480

diplomatic dude he's been very

1388
00:58:54,119 --> 00:59:01,240
diplomatic I'm trying I'm trying

1389
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:06,440
because the you know Hoy and D Man and

1390
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:09,879
skdy they uh as harsh as their rules

1391
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,720
were they listened they would hear you

1392
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:15,640
out and uh they would listen to if

1393
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:18,639
somebody wanted to talk to them about an

1394
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:20,519
issue or a problem like you know they

1395
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:25,279
heard it and

1396
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:27,159
uh I'm I can't fix every problem and do

1397
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,760
everything that every everybody wants on

1398
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:34,159
the Cabana but I am trying and yeah

1399
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:36,680
skiddy is helping me um so he's doing

1400
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:40,480
pretty much all of my technical stuff

1401
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:43,879
and so if I have a problem I hit skdy up

1402
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,838
and be like hey man uh you know somebody

1403
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,680
told me the backgrounds aren't working

1404
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:49,639
they can't change their background so

1405
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:52,038
yeah Sky because I don't know anything

1406
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:54,199
about computers I still want to set you

1407
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:57,359
guys up a Discord so you have some sort

1408
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:59,960
of like uh I think that they can work

1409
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:02,400
integrate really well to each other the

1410
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,159
cab just for like an alltime chat room

1411
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,039
versus I got a live chat on the Cabana

1412
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:09,038
that I want people to start utilizing

1413
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,119
pop up in there in the morning is there

1414
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,760
live chats on there there's a live chat

1415
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,400
on the Cabana I'm trying to make it so

1416
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,319
we don't have to go to an external

1417
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:21,039
website I mean that is the idea right

1418
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:23,719
that's the idea so that's my hold up on

1419
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,240
the store right now is um I'm having an

1420
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:27,639
issue with credit card payment

1421
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,038
processors that's going to be your

1422
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:33,000
hardest um it's such a pain in the ass

1423
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:36,240
but one of the things is Visa has sent

1424
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,079
out some major major made major issues

1425
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:42,159
like even if you can get a credit card

1426
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:43,559
processor Visa has hit two of the major

1427
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:47,000
seed banks with

1428
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:51,000
$250,000 fines per transaction that they

1429
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,519
find people using Visa to buy cannabis

1430
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,199
seeds so even if the processor lets you

1431
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,719
run through and do it visa will come

1432
01:00:56,199 --> 01:01:00,318
after your ass and come after you for

1433
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:02,719
250k per transaction so it's kind of

1434
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:05,798
terrifying little tips of the trades

1435
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:08,078
that I've been Gathering From so many

1436
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:09,559
people who vend their own seeds on their

1437
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,559
own website so I've been talking to

1438
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:15,920
everybody and uh I used to be the king

1439
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:17,720
of it bro like for for 15 years I was

1440
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,960
the only one doing it I was gonna say

1441
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:23,719
you you were the first one who always

1442
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:26,639
had your own site and yeah I had to

1443
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:28,439
everybody hated my ass

1444
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:30,440
but man that's the you probably did

1445
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,280
better than everybody else because man

1446
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,400
you didn't have any middleman so even if

1447
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:37,359
you did half the volume you're

1448
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,318
making same amount of money because

1449
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:42,279
you're doing it all yourself so I had

1450
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,798
one credit card company that worked with

1451
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,920
me for seven years and it was amazing

1452
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:49,400
and I made the mistake of telling one

1453
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,639
person that I thought I trusted who I

1454
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,079
used and then they [ __ ] me over and

1455
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:55,480
then turned me into the credit card

1456
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:56,359
company and I lost it what the [ __ ] and

1457
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,838
ever since

1458
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:02,358
then nothing and I started to go back to

1459
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:05,719
look into using them and then you know a

1460
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:08,920
few of the big big seed banks got hit by

1461
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:10,519
vison I was like there is no [ __ ] way

1462
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,200
I wouldn't blow my brains out after

1463
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:16,759
getting a $250,000 F that would be it

1464
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:19,159
man that' be awful yeah so until

1465
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,640
until until major banks are willing to

1466
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:24,558
work with it I would be very very

1467
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:27,920
hesitant to do that there's Bitcoin

1468
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:30,519
there's other things you can use in the

1469
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,079
meantime and get around it before uh we

1470
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:33,559
get involved with Visa because they are

1471
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,200
a nightmare right now and they are

1472
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:39,440
literally chasing cannabis seed CS

1473
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:42,000
specifically they have someone on that

1474
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,278
247 so funny how like you know they do

1475
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,159
the farm bill and they say it's legal

1476
01:02:44,278 --> 01:02:48,559
and everybody kind of

1477
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:51,960
starts you know you see it really open

1478
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,839
up and you know banks are popping up you

1479
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:57,519
know people are you know you got clones

1480
01:02:53,838 --> 01:03:00,278
going every which way yeah and um but

1481
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:02,440
then they still don't you know they're

1482
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:03,880
mad about the money still it's like

1483
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,400
until they can find a way to fully get

1484
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:09,440
their hands on that [ __ ] money that's

1485
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:13,680
when it starts yeah and

1486
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:17,200
uh I mean that's not good for us but uh

1487
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:19,960
it's we go a we got a mint like a cabana

1488

1545
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:51,960
it those are awesome to have stuff like

1546

1547
01:05:51,960 --> 01:06:00,159

1553
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,160
post them up in your threads that

1554
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:14,000
you in your Forum over there because

1555
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:16,318
there's some cool stuff in it and just

1556
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,760
the history and

1557
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:21,719
seeing where we were to where we're at

1558
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,039
in the genetics game it's it's also so

1559
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:24,919
important of learning about what's in

1560
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,839
your current day genetics those

1561
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,599
cataloges have opened up a world for me

1562
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,400
absolute world of understanding what I'm

1563
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,240
working with what I'm seeing uh Neville

1564
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,240
did a great job of describing and

1565
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,838
documenting his stuff so like you know

1566
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:41,759
like on on uh on our breed your

1567
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:43,639
Syndicate uh Discord I have all those

1568
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,559
cataloges up for everyone to see you

1569
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:48,480
know the joins and uh and I I put them

1570
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,798
up for free on the comand as well

1571
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,079
because I think it's important to share

1572
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:54,079
that so we're on it even playing field

1573
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,359
so that there's no you know information

1574
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,079
being secret scrolled away

1575
01:06:56,358 --> 01:07:00,639
everything like that should be seen so

1576
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,880
we can all learn it's not all [ __ ]

1577
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:05,719
we're looking at it's it's it's facts

1578
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,920
you know what I mean as close as we can

1579
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:11,038
get to

1580
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,599
facts yeah man and uh back in the day

1581
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:17,079
they actually they wanted to tell you

1582
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:20,559
what's in it and these days

1583
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:24,440
like I'm so skeptical of when people

1584
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:27,359
even say you know oh this is runts or

1585
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:31,000
Lemon Cherry gelato or something like

1586
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:33,400
like what cut are you doing this with

1587
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,079
you know what I mean I mean the fact is

1588
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,720
all gelato looks the [ __ ] same bro so

1589
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,640
like you could pass off whatever is

1590
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:42,358
whatever it's a dead end breeding

1591
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:45,879
section you know there's so many gelato

1592
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:50,000
crosses and s1s it's like do you are you

1593
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:53,318
really rocking this to g33 or G you know

1594
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,639
gelato 41 or what is this really cross

1595
01:07:53,318 --> 01:07:57,880
to and I think is this some crappy

1596
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:00,719
there's a fair majority of the market

1597
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:04,400
out there where it's like they have a

1598
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:06,480
nice cut of something yeah it might be

1599
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,000
great I'm not faulting them but is it

1600
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,519
really the same I mean and that's the

1601
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,440
thing they know most of the market won't

1602
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:13,480
know anyway so what the [ __ ] do they

1603
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,600
care it's a

1604
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,960
shortcut yeah yeah collecting it's a

1605
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:22,838
it's a thing in itself that takes time

1606
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:24,480
you have to um make relationships earn

1607
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:26,238
trust from people to get some of these

1608
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,399
rare old cuts

1609
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,959
and uh a lot of these guys just don't

1610
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:33,479
get that because they didn't have the

1611
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,759
Forum experience which is why I like I I

1612
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:38,559
impressed so hard on some of this next

1613
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:41,479
Generation you have a chance to be to

1614
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,440
learn what we went through during our

1615
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:45,198
era by joining the Cabana and

1616
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:47,399
interacting there you get some of that

1617
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:49,358
Forum experience you get to learn some

1618
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:52,559
of the the ins and outs the dos and

1619
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:55,440
dones what stepping on toes really means

1620
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,880
like it's all there to be learned like

1621
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:01,719

1622
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:04,039
culture alive for us you know and you

1623
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:05,719
got to respect the Clone or or the seat

1624
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:08,679
or whatever because you'll see real

1625
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:11,560
quick like on the Cabana like news we

1626
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:14,440
might not have that much traffic but

1627
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:17,239
news spreads like wildfire so if you did

1628
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:21,318
you know something to somebody or you

1629
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:23,879
know they're not you'll be on the do not

1630
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:26,679
do not send clone list real fast the old

1631
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:29,798
black list yeah that's a damn sure

1632
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:32,600
that's a damn sure it's pretty easy to

1633
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:34,838
get on the will help you out list and

1634
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:38,199
it's even easier to get on the we don't

1635
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:39,759
[ __ ] with you list so because as much as

1636
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:42,318
as much as the industry and the

1637
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,600
community's grown it's still a pretty

1638
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:47,480
small club right and everyone kind of

1639
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:50,279
still knows everybody you know there's

1640
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:52,678
not a lot of like young Crews that are

1641
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:54,920
really like making motion on their own

1642
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:57,199
that aren't you know falling on the back

1643
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:59,560
standing on the the the backs of giants

1644
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:01,759
so to speak right so like we're all

1645
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,360
still connected like we're just sitting

1646
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,280
here trading stories like we were all

1647
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:10,158
bumping elbows 10 years ago you know

1648
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:12,439
right like you know here we are so it's

1649
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,039
and if you're still in it now and plan

1650
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:15,319
on being in it for the next 10 years

1651
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:17,560
you're gonna you know you're gonna bump

1652
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:19,759
into people I mean I've always said that

1653
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,239
like you can't you can't burn bridges in

1654
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,719
this industry because it comes back

1655
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:25,158
around real easy and some some people

1656
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,880
are just here to make a quick Buck I

1657
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:29,799
guess and get out but that's I don't

1658
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,800
think that's any of us

1659
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:36,279
here after this many

1660
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,239
years you know you know that the we

1661
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:39,279
we've all got issues with being obsessed

1662
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:40,839
with this

1663
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:44,000
[ __ ]

1664
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:45,920
yeah for sure had dreams about it like

1665
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,840
close your eyes and that's what you see

1666
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:53,000
and that's what you you know eat live

1667
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:55,039
sleep whatever all of it yeah collect it

1668
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,520
like I mean I got this old original I

1669
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:59,238
think you can see here it's the old

1670
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:02,159
original hay Cosmic Boogie poster

1671
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:04,039
probably spent [ __ ] way more than I'd

1672
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:07,000
ever care to admit on that [ __ ]

1673
01:11:04,039 --> 01:11:10,319
but it's because I live dream sleep

1674
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,560
strains you know the marketing the

1675
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:14,719
history the culture I know all you guys

1676
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,520
do too what's the most you ever spent on

1677
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:19,760
a pack of

1678
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:23,080
seeds probably a few grand like

1679
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,800
realistically on some old uh would it

1680
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:28,880
been C Mist I think yeah

1681
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:31,560
oh wow a few grand when when seed money

1682

1683
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,159
really care

1684
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,159
though I used

1685
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:43,639

you ever spent what was it it it was a

1688
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,439
few

1689
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:56,840
grand on what uh I think it

1690
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:58,678
was uh res Sour Diesel of some kind yeah

1691

limited drops and then auctions and all

1693
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:10,760

1722
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,599
after being not even after being

1723
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,279
snitched I've never like snitched But

1724
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,760
like after dealing with what I dealt

1725
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:31,279
with past two years uh getting attacked

1726
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:34,760
by you know his was such a big deal at

1727
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:38,319
the time though like dude it was bad and

1728
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:41,079
uh it scared a lot of people um it did

1729
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:44,439
it did I remember deleting all of my

1730
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:47,119
pictures on icy mag and everything it

1731
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:50,439
affected everyone

1732
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:50,439
yeah all the

1733
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:59,079
evidence but he did it s d IBL and that

1734
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,159
was his contribution to the industry and

1735
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:04,039
I feel like like I remember going

1736
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:07,319
through PS and PS when he did his chem D

1737
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:09,519
IBL and I and I had all the chem Cuts

1738
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:13,359
you know and I was like these are all

1739
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,679
just like leafy H his px2 was way better

1740
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:18,279
than the

1741
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:20,079
IBL I was trash I still have some when

1742
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:21,840
he when he worked with the chem I didn't

1743
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:24,760
think he did anything amazing with it

1744
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,560
you know like I think I think uh JJ had

1745
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:30,119
the him uh in a much better place back

1746
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:33,039
then than than re did but but re got

1747
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:35,079
lucky with the sour and was able to you

1748
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:37,119
know get that in a pretty good

1749
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:39,319
representation and Seed form and that

1750
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:40,599
was his his contribution to the scene

1751
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:43,079
and then when he went down he did

1752
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,079
everybody dirty and you know that showed

1753
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:46,679
his true

1754
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:48,279
colors he was just never nice to begin

1755
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:51,440
with dude he was always a [ __ ] dick

1756
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:53,639
so it's like always a dick man I would

1757
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,799
spend so much money on steeds and try

1758
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:59,560
and ask a question and like get ignored

1759
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:03,679
for months and then get like a two-word

1760
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:05,800
reply of like no or you know like I

1761
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,960
think he had a lot of troll accounts

1762
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:11,360
back then sure he was he got hyen lonon

1763
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,760
removed from Icy mag for a little bit so

1764
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:15,799
I'll never forget that [ __ ] either

1765
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,000
that's my boy you know that's my boy and

1766
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,679
he was trying to get to the bottom of

1767
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,319
the chem story before anybody else was

1768
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:25,560
he started the gem 101 thre it if you

1769
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:27,799
guys remember that I do I see yeah yeah

1770
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,159
i p a lot of people off him trying to

1771
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,279
get to the bottom of that story because

1772
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:34,198
nothing was making [ __ ] sense yeah

1773
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:36,960
you know now we know a lot more than we

1774
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:40,158
did then and still pissing people off

1775
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,719
with that info that's funny some people

1776
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:44,799
will never give up and they'll always

1777
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:47,319
have their own versions of stuff but I

1778
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:51,320
go with

1779
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:53,319
uh what makes the most sense to me yeah

1780
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:55,439
I I you know like after after being able

1781
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:58,119
to S1 a lot of these plants

1782
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:00,479
go through their populations seeing what

1783
01:15:58,119 --> 01:16:02,479
lies in them outcrossing them seeing

1784
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:05,000
what you're getting in the outcrosses

1785
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:08,039
tells the real story of what's in these

1786
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,880
plants and just knowing other lines and

1787
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:12,840
being able to see what was in their room

1788
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:16,639
get a good idea run those lines crossing

1789
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:19,440
it you'll find out chem 91 is the pure

1790
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:22,079
one chem Cy the original chem sis not

1791
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:24,119
Cham a which was the second chem sis the

1792
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,639
original chem CIS was probably a sister

1793
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:28,800
of chm91

1794
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:31,319
everything else is a hybrid or a hybrid

1795
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,440
of a hybrid uh when when you get to the

1796
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:34,960
cham 1 through four which is like an nl5

1797
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:38,279
Haze chem

1798
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:41,279
91 the chamd would be like a chem 91

1799
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:44,039
Mass super scun things like that became

1800
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:46,840
very true and easy to see after some

1801
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:48,359
time and they don't like those stories

1802
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,960
those are not stories that help their

1803
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:53,119
situations even though like they were in

1804
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,039
their teens like I get why they would

1805
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,719
say what they did and did what they did

1806
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:59,119
like no blame there I love uh Kim dog

1807
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:02,000
Greg I love that dude he's always been

1808
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:03,920
so cool to me but like you know plants

1809
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,319
don't lie people

1810
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:09,119
do that's how it's always turned out

1811
01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:13,319
sometimes people are just ignorant too

1812
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:16,479
and they not ignorant just you know

1813
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:19,039
unconsciously ignorant to what yeah you

1814
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:22,158
know yeah they can get wrong especially

1815
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:25,479
when you get a plant and it's not like

1816
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:29,399
you get a piece of paper with a you know

1817
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:32,158
a car on this thing you know exactly

1818
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:33,479
yeah it's you got to take it you got to

1819
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:35,679
take it for what it is and what you can

1820
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:39,158
make off of it and then see what happens

1821
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:42,199
with it at one point Kim dog said

1822
01:17:39,158 --> 01:17:43,719
anything that comes from me is Kem dog

1823
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:46,839
and that was one of the first telling

1824
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:49,079
things you know and then certainly as as

1825
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,920
over the years as people started getting

1826
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:52,840
different chmd clones that came directly

1827
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,800
from him and comparing them and we all

1828
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:59,719
find out [ __ ] there's like nine chmd

1829
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:01,600
they're all kind of similar not that's

1830
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:03,920
when things like really started hitting

1831
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,440
the fan and it and it became very

1832
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:10,359
obvious something different had

1833
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:12,158
happened yeah kimd is so recognizable

1834
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:14,198
you know if you've grown it like you can

1835
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:16,359
spot it

1836
01:18:14,198 --> 01:18:20,079
immediately I feel like we had the real

1837
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:22,719
kimd back in the day and probably that

1838
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:26,079
was probably all uh you know hops Lon

1839
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:29,039
also before we knew what it was right

1840
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:33,119
yeah all that high maintenance like need

1841
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:36,198
for the plant you know so oh my God yes

1842
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:38,238
I mean I I I last time I talked to

1843
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:40,359
canado he was still growing all the same

1844
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:43,119
chem cuts that I passed him you know

1845
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:45,119
that was like years ago on the Forum

1846
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:47,880
with him like he was just a tent grower

1847
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,880
before he was a breeder oh yeah yeah and

1848
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,600
he just was just begging for like a

1849
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:53,520
legit chem cut and I remember people

1850
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,520
just like oh you're just a tent grower

1851
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,199
and I felt bad for him and you know I

1852
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,199
had this warehouse and and you know and

1853
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:01,479
I was like I was like dude you're right

1854
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:03,238
down the street for me like I'll just

1855
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:06,158

1857
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,799

1858
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,960
the same Cuts he has till this day so if

1859

1860
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,319
was that was the cuts we all had from

1861
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,159
the crew that all was like from Hoe from

1862
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:21,920
the Cabana everybody that was on the on

1863
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:25,519
the Cabana then had those same You Still

1864
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:29,239
rocking so uh is K Still rocking them

1865
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:32,719
I'm not I'm not sure are you I'm not I'm

1866
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:35,198
I'm I'm I'm I'm no grow right now

1867
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,600
unfortunately I'll get back there you'll

1868
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:40,479
get back there anything we can ever do

1869
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,800
just let me know too anything so for

1870
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:44,279
sure we'll we'll jump I'll be jumping

1871
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,520
back on it I got a couple things in the

1872
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:49,759
works for the next year awesome so but

1873
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,880
like I said I've been you know stuck in

1874
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:55,400
the in the corporate Matrix of cannabis

1875
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:57,079
for the last couple years it's been been

1876
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:58,920
you know just a different perspective so

1877
01:19:57,079 --> 01:20:00,800
it's like it's nice to have these

1878
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,760
conversations about the old days and

1879
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,199
like still know that there's people that

1880
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,320
care about not just the history but

1881
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:09,519
genetics themselves about the plant the

1882
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:11,840
quality you know like because it's just

1883
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,920
that's the piece that's really missing

1884
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,119
you know everything can't just be sales

1885
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,800
and marketing like there's no substance

1886
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:23,000
to that know at the end of the day yeah

1887
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,079
we're losing a piece of that you know so

1888
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,039
I think the the pendulum was swing in

1889
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:29,479
the industry the other way in a couple

1890
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:32,439
years but you got a whole new generation

1891
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:34,198
of of young smokers consumers that you

1892
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:35,759
know they don't know so they have to be

1893
01:20:34,198 --> 01:20:38,759
educated you know and they don't know

1894
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,679
what's possible so I forgot who was it

1895
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,079
just posted it like on Blacklist or

1896
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:45,119
something on on Instagram like in the

1897
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:47,238
last couple weeks and someone in the

1898
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,399
comments was like oh all weed came from

1899
01:20:47,238 --> 01:20:51,119
cookies and it was like and people were

1900
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:54,679
making memes about it like oh we eat

1901
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:56,559
carefood cookie like you know like you

1902
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:59,279
know but that's that's because that's

1903
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,320
with the information there's no good

1904
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:03,920
data like neutral information that's out

1905
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:06,599
there the only thing there is is places

1906
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:12,000
like the Cabana because everything else

1907
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:12,000
has a marketing spin an agenda to sell

1908
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,880
something yeah yeah and that's like

1909
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,519
there's a lack of Purity that was what

1910
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,760
was beautiful about those old days is

1911
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:23,800
like we were all just excited like to

1912
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,360
just have it and be there and you know

1913
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:29,159
what I mean wasn't and what some people

1914
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:33,359
don't realize about the

1915
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:35,479
Cabana is it was invite only like

1916
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:39,599
somebody had to invite you you had to

1917
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:43,198
get approved so it really like limited

1918
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:49,520
like the stock of people that we had

1919
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:51,960
were already top tier you know and the

1920
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:54,800
you know all these breeders that we talk

1921
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:58,800
about and stuff they were all members of

1922
01:21:54,800 --> 01:22:01,159
the Cabana um at some point you know

1923
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:05,719
they they got invited they got approved

1924
01:22:01,158 --> 01:22:07,319
they were on there for you know and they

1925
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:09,239
were part of the special Community

1926
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:11,679
because it was special to be part of

1927
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:14,079
something that you know anybody could be

1928
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:16,399
on IC mag not everybody could be on the

1929
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:19,119
exactly exactly most of them didn't even

1930
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:20,920
know command existed to be honest it was

1931
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:22,880
invisible you could Google it and

1932
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:26,880
nothing would come up unless you typed

1933
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:28,560
in the exact web address yeah the exact

1934
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:32,600
web address up there you would never

1935
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,639
find it and that was by Design yeah and

1936
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,880
it's

1937
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:40,079
been it's been crazy doing

1938
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:43,480
it yeah it's been it's been crazy trying

1939
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:46,039
to adjust to the new modern times

1940
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:50,238
and try and make the

1941
01:22:46,039 --> 01:22:54,119
Cabana um feel that way like it's still

1942
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:57,000
kind of exclusive but open to the public

1943
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:59,599
and uh that's that's been the hardest

1944
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:03,000
part but it

1945
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:06,560
uh I think people are coming together we

1946
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,359
have more visitors averaging online

1947
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,960
every day now so we're any given time

1948
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:16,119
there's you know close to 100 visitors

1949
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:18,359
on online now that's awesome and

1950
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:19,840
uh those are small numbers when you

1951
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:23,319
think about you

1952
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:25,760
know THC farmer and IC mag but they've

1953
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:27,759
been open 20 years to the public quality

1954
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:31,520
over quantity brother quality over

1955
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:33,239
quantity quality over quantity and so

1956
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,440
come come over to the Cabana I want

1957
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:38,799
everybody to register we need people to

1958
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:41,960
register that's the driving force start

1959
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,920
commenting get some threads up there and

1960
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:46,119
website scrolling across the bottom here

1961
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,000
again so there should be no confusion

1962
01:23:46,119 --> 01:23:51,800
about how to get there there's no

1963
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,920
[ __ ] excuse fellas and ladies more

1964
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:57,880
ladies would be nice you know more boom

1965
01:23:54,920 --> 01:24:00,760
if we got ideas to do anything you know

1966
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:03,600
you guys got an idea for the forums send

1967
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:05,440
me I think the the seed store is going

1968
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,320
to be the most vital thing because we've

1969
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:08,839
talked about it you know having

1970
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:11,079
something that's free of all this

1971
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,440
marketing and hype [ __ ] something

1972
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:16,238
that's like a neutral territory for

1973
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:19,119
people to buy sell trade genetics like

1974
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:21,678
is huge because I mean even Matt said it

1975
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,760
like there's no real domestic seed

1976
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:25,800
vendors that are even doing it right

1977
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,840
because everything is just pumping hype

1978
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:31,320
and marketing stuff you just have like

1979
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:32,279
agenda this this neutral playing Ground

1980
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:34,920
you

1981
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:36,559
know and in addition to that a space

1982
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:39,520
where we can have open discourse and

1983
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:43,039
discussion about it but but um just the

1984
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:45,360
neutral you know Marketplace of of of

1985
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:47,600
seeds where you know any breeder can go

1986
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:49,198
up there and just list it but you're not

1987
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,920
you're not getting extra hype over

1988
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:52,839
anybody else because you're paying more

1989
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,600
because like every breeder is just on

1990
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:57,000
that even playing field and it's about

1991
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:00,000
the genetics and like it's amazing that

1992
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,079
we're in 2024 and we still don't have an

1993
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,439
online seed vendor that exists that that

1994
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:07,399
can do that I really truly believe there

1995
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:08,599
needs to be some vetting too I really do

1996
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:10,879
like there's going to be people of

1997
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,719
course that don't have big followings

1998
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,239
that should be on there because we know

1999
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,359
that they've been making seats forever

2000
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,279
and are good people but there are just

2001
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:21,039
so many [ __ ] bags that'll sign up that

2002
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:22,960
are just going to exploit it you know

2003
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:26,238
that's that's the hard part that's what

2004
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,719
the forum is for so so complete complete

2005
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:31,599
grow log let's you grow this out let's

2006
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,600
see it you know yeah if you're somebody

2007
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,840
that we've never heard of that can't

2008
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,440
show and prove anything of course you're

2009
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:43,880
not gonna be a vendor on there

2010
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:46,118
luckily we got enough vendors that can

2011
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:47,920
show and improve that have been doing

2012
01:25:46,118 --> 01:25:52,399
this a long time that are

2013
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:55,039
trustworthy that I I got no problem

2014
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:56,920
making people wait until they can

2015
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:58,920
until they can show them proof you know

2016
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,039
what I mean I'm not saying no to anybody

2017
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:03,480
but you gotta you got to go through the

2018
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,399
process and prove yourself and then boom

2019
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:07,079
you can do it you know and you know most

2020
01:26:05,399 --> 01:26:08,519
scammers won't go through the process of

2021
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:11,840
doing that in the first place it kind of

2022
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:13,920
weeds them out pretty fast exactly so

2023
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,480
there will be some work you want to you

2024
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,880
want to be able to offer seeds on there

2025
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:20,399
it will be some work but that's through

2026
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:22,639
the actual store I want people to know

2027

2190
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:42,399
since taking over the Cabana than I had

2191
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:43,719
for a couple of years there and it's

2192
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:46,439
been nice just

2193
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:49,800
to have regular communication with those

2194
01:33:46,439 --> 01:33:52,319
guys and for them to trust me to do this

2195
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:55,679
it's great that I got so many homies

2196
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:57,559

2197
01:33:55,679 --> 01:34:00,158
over the years and even though it's slow

2198
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:02,639
everybody's still involved and pushing

2199
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:03,920
for it and we just need to get it

2201
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:09,639
something that's super cool and unique

2202
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:13,359
different than Instagram and different

2203
01:34:09,639 --> 01:34:16,480

Chris and Oki cared about you know you

2236
01:35:42,118 --> 01:35:45,839
know what's funny dude in doing The

2237
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:49,479
Syndicate when I first started doing

2238
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:51,000
this like it was an Instagram live feed

2239
01:35:49,479 --> 01:35:52,638
right and there would be like 20 people

2240
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,600
in there listening to me Yap about

2241
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:57,960
genetics and slowly but surely ended up

2242
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,600
being you know 300 400 people watching

2243
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:02,399
live and and at no time did I think it

2244
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,239
would ever surpass that usually it was

2245
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:06,679
just people trying to egg me on to talk

2246
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:09,279
[ __ ] about someone right and as I

2247
01:36:06,679 --> 01:36:12,118
brought it onto YouTube and realized now

2248
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:14,279
we've got this Discord of 500 people and

2249
01:36:12,118 --> 01:36:16,839
they're all super interested in genetics

2250
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:18,719
a lot of them from the Next Generation

2251
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,920
and it's giv me a lot of Hope because I

2252
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,679
didn't have a lot of Hope for any of it

2253
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:24,679
and it just goes to show like you put in

2254
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:26,719
the work it'll [ __ ] happen if you

2255
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:28,760
stick with it you put in the work it'll

2256
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:31,560
happen and we can all make a big [ __ ]

2257
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:33,960
change with what's coming we can re re

2258
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:36,239
reignite this culture together I tell

2259
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:38,480
you that's been the hardest thing for me

2260
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:40,879
because I'm actually like I mentioned it

2261
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:44,399
before like I'm a natural hater but I'm

2262
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:46,840
really trying to embrace the the new

2263
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:48,719
generation man I got to give them a lot

2264
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:50,840
more credit than I do sometimes I

2265
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:52,279
naturally want to hate on some of these

2266
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,119
guys but then sometimes I see what

2267
01:36:52,279 --> 01:36:58,679
they're doing and I'm you know I'm

2268
01:36:55,118 --> 01:37:00,880
impressed so

2269
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:03,199
um never forget that you can learn

2270
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,480
something from the young guys man yeah

2271
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:07,879
dude I'm learning all the a prime

2272
01:37:05,479 --> 01:37:09,678
example of the I know we're going super

2273
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,960
long here but a prime example of

2274
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:15,079
learning from the young gu is Big Willie

2275
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:17,920
man out in NorCal Wily's Garden in

2276
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:20,719
Greenhouse yeah he's he's a young kid

2277
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,560
I've known him for forever and he grinds

2278
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:27,359
harder than anybody he works nonstop

2279
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:29,880
he's always like I love that like

2280
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:31,920
grinding hard and he's learning new tech

2281
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,760
and he he's taught me a ton of stuff

2282
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,800
over the years man so always listen to

2283
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:38,639
the young guys man yeah we got a good

2284
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,279
crew of young ones in in our close

2285
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:42,960
Circle too that it blows my mind that

2286
01:37:41,279 --> 01:37:44,920
there are young guys that give a [ __ ]

2287
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:47,158
about this stuff and and like I said it

2288
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:49,679
gives me a lot of Hope and I think uh

2289
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:51,399
even this episode people [ __ ] loved

2290
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:53,679
the last episode they're going to love

2291
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:55,879
this episode and the more more more

2292
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:58,118
often we do this the more we integrate

2293
01:37:55,880 --> 01:38:00,000
the more the more change we can make

2294
01:37:58,118 --> 01:38:01,759
together guys and I want to see that

2295
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,238
seed site pop up because I think that'll

2296
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:06,520
be a big difference too

2297
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:08,879
absolutely so I appreciate you guys for

2298
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,599

2299
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,199
the forums alive it's important to all

2300
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:15,000
of us that were there and I think it's

2301
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:16,879
important to share the culture with the

2302
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,198
younger guys who weren't and give them

2303
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:22,960
an opportunity to be a part of what we

2304
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:25,439
had and let's make it our own again

2305

stoked been working on it for years they

2347
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:17,399
are in my opinion the best chem 91

2348
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:21,118
regular seeds where you can reliably

2349
01:40:17,399 --> 01:40:23,920
pick out like Amplified chem 91 turps

2350

2358
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:45,800
doesn't think there's going to be a lot

2359
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:47,880
