written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,479
what we're going to be talking about for

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,760
a bit I'm pretty excited about this one

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,399
because it's got one of my oldest

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,580
friends on it uh I've been trying to

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,740
keep his name and his Visage secret for

30
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,679
a while uh to protect him or whatever

31
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:19,438
but he has decided that he is willing to

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,799
come on and chat uh in person and so the

33
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:26,059
guy that I call Staten Island is my very

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,040
very old friend Gabby uh he's the reason

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,379
uh why I got the dog he's the reason why

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
I got the super skunk uh he's the guy

37
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,539
that brought them West uh you're gonna

38
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,158
hear a bunch of stuff of him talking uh

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,700
which some some of it will probably be

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,680
pretty new but you know he was

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,200
um you know he was buddies with klopp

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,479
which a lot of people Call Weasel

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,399
um he played a pretty important role in

44
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,159
my opinion about keeping the chem dog

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,859
alive and around

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,040
the guys on the west coast skunk VA I

47
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,359
see Collective myself you know all of us

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,180
really

49
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,340
um owe it to him for the reason why we

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,219
got the chem dog and and our little crew

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,959
kept it together for a long time and you

52
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,439
know he's done a variety of things in

53
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,199
cannabis during his life uh he's not

54
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,939
very well known but he played some

55
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,759
pretty important roles and so in

56
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:23,520
addition to being uh you know my really

57
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,500
old friend I'm super glad that he's

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,719
gonna finally show his face and start

59
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,120
talking a bit he might be a little bit

60
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,300
embarrassed about it or discount what he

61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,420
did but in my opinion he's pretty darn

62
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,520
important in the scene and he really did

63
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,639
a lot to push cannabis forward not just

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,260
from a genetics perspective but from

65
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,119
um you know teaching people how to grow

66
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,299
weed and opening up stores when it was

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,640
pretty risque and so I'm just really

68
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,680
stoked to be able to bring a super old

69
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,679
friend on and chat and I hope you all

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,000
like it and this will be a multi-part

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,099
episode so I guess um kick back and

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,860
we'll insert this on each one of the

73
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:07,979
episodes so that there is some kind of

74
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,099
Clarity for each one one other point is

75
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,539
that because he is the way that he is uh

76
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,839
you're going to hear a lot of people's

77
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:18,598
real names maybe not so much their uh

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,598
the internet handles or their you know

79
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,000
their forum names or whatever because uh

80
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,799
he might not know those

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,158
um so a lot of people when he talks

82
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,099
about klopp for instance uh klopp is is

83
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:35,340
weasel who is one of the critical people

84
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:37,919
early on in the sour diesel tale

85
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,860
um you know uh Ben is IC Collective

86
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,719
Jason is scuntha or skunk VA as the case

87
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,599
may be I suppose

88
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,340
um and so he drops names so often

89
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,579
there's no way for Matt and I to really

90
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,819
edit it out so if that's what it is here

91
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,340
you go that's who we are oh oh also one

92
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:58,318
more thing the audio is kind of all over

93
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,959
the place uh as far as the clarity

94
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,060
there's some feedback from it's just

95
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,000
we're doing these interviews and it was

96
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,000
so important to get this it's it's the

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,539
one of the main reasons that this this

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,878
clone made it to Guys Like Me CSI and

99
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,399
and the rest of the country and for

100
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,319
whatever for what it is and um it was so

101
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,899
important to get it done that we felt

102
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,939
that audio quality was less important

103
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:28,758
than audio content so we hope you'll

104
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,759
excuse that too so and enjoy

105
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,079
I almost brought it up but I didn't want

106
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,159
to bring it up when we were recording

107
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,719
because I was like I was like maybe

108
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,740
he'll hate me and want me to cut it out

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,000
but

110
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,220
D you know I uh do you remember when we

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,220
were like the people that were taking

112
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,900
all that BHO down to all the clubs and

113
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,120
like none of them had ever seen it and

114
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:53,579
we had to teach them how to use it and

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,439
like spot them stuff because they had no

116
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,300
BHO they'd never seen it before they

117
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,699
didn't even believe that it was honestly

118
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,460
this is one of my favorite stories to

119
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,400
tell let's tell it let's tell it I'm

120
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,539
telling that story

121
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,959
I don't think I'm incriminating myself

122
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:13,639
30 years later no no I mean it was more

123
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,620
like 20-ish but still yeah like

124
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,740
when I told Francis before we start was

125
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,139
I was doing BHO in 2006 and I thought I

126
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,259
was a [ __ ] Pioneer so hearing this go

127
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,538
ahead tell your story okay so did you

128
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,538
hit record yet yeah because I don't see

129
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:34,560
it recording it's recording I do

130
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:36,599
Oh weird so this was in

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,319
well I opened up the garden spout in

132
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,000
2002. and so I think I got fired from

133
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,180
Hydro Depot

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,500
and that's another story about uh fired

135
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,560
from Hydro Depot it must have been

136
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,538
either 2000 or 2001. I think it was ten

137
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,180
thousand and it was that time in between

138
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:55,620
right exactly because the only reason

139
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,720
why I was doing it was trying to figure

140
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,620
out how to make money

141
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,900
um

142
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,340
you know in between doing that you know

143
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,739
once I opened up the garden spot I

144
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:07,739
wasn't [ __ ] around like that

145
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,319
um but I got shown how to make

146
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,660
uh BHO

147
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,459
unfortunately at the time like the way

148
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,220
we knew how to do it was like in a PVC

149
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:19,439
pipe yes yeah that's how we got taught

150
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,039
doing now luckily even though I was open

151
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,538
blasting I lived like on top of a hill

152
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:26,399
you know and you know wasn't just like

153
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,019
doing it indoors I was doing it like

154
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,478
whether it was outdoor ventilation

155
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:34,139
happening and you know put like a coffee

156
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,579
filter on the bottom of a PVC pipe and a

157
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,579
little screen too

158
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,579
on

159
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,670
[Music]

160
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,580
it it fit the fitting perfect

161
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,120
okay I'm not like open blasting here

162
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,859
um

163
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,600
but so like

164
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,460
I made the first BHO I had ever seen or

165
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,280
or heard of and I wish I can remember

166
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,620
where I learned about it but yeah who

167
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,179
taught you like he was teaching me I was

168
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,780
trying to think the other day of who

169
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,699
taught you but Gabby had this property

170
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:15,899
in the in the Hills above where I live

171
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,860
now

172
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,079
um and he had like I don't know it was

173
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,680
like 28 Acres or something like that and

174
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:25,740
so we never we never had any like like

175
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,598
of the many stories of explosions or

176
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,639
Terror that went on because we literally

177
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,579
went out and like on top of a hill in

178
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,220
the middle of a field and you know away

179
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,978
from All Electronics and so you were not

180
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,720
doing this in San Diego garages like no

181
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:41,279
we did it literally on a on a mountain

182
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,440
on a mountain you know on a Hilltop I

183
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,418
can't I can't claim the same a Hilltop

184
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,120
with wind but you know we had to get

185
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,098
like there wasn't any machines yet it

186
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,680
was literally like he said it was skinny

187
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:55,319
PVC tubes that we cut themselves

188
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,959
disclaimer do not do this no don't do

189
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,580
the first way to do this

190
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,680
don't do any of it you know there was no

191
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,359
we didn't know any old video we didn't

192
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,720
know anything about purging the only way

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,979
that we purged that by was by stirring

194
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,979
it you know a little bit

195
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,639
I would have a glass dish with all the

196
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:19,860
solvent you know extracted stuff but it

197
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,478
was still bubbling yeah and in order to

198
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,240
make it happen faster we would put that

199
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:26,038
dish in another dish where we would pour

200
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
a boiling water boiling water yeah

201
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,939
boiling water like we had already you

202
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,918
know had it collected there warm boiling

203
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,259
right there and we would do that and

204
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,958
then we'd do it again until it stopped

205
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:39,059
being active and it's almost wet I mean

206
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,000
it obviously still had plenty of butane

207
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,399
in it you know yeah

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,100
I would put it in a jar

209
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,899
and we would bring it to the cannabis

210
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,700
clubs in Oakland and in San Francisco

211
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,879
and in Berkeley

212
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,420
and they had never seen anything like it

213
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:02,399
and it you know for the time this [ __ ]

214
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:06,299
was amazing yeah but this was prior to

215
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,919
you know the modern dab rig sure there

216
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:11,039
was none of those accoutrements like

217
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,139
right we would smear it on top of weed

218
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,539
then we figured out that like there was

219
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,360
those old like like disc Puck looking

220
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,778
charcoals and we would like light the

221
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,778
charcoal

222
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:29,339
yeah and then Gabby and I would go down

223
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,200
to the bay and like the store owners it

224
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,540
was such a foreign substance to them

225
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,640
that like we would have to spot it to

226
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,319
them to like the owners and like leave

227
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,500
it with them and wait for female

228
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,500
supplies to the store okay sure go yeah

229
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,759
go we used to smoke it out of crack

230
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,899
pipes

231
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,659
yeah that was like or you know

232
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,539
you know well not like a straight tube

233
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,939
but just like

234
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:59,039
yeah the meth pipe more of a meth pipe I

235
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,620
don't really I never smoked cracker meth

236
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,759
thank God so yeah I did I did and that's

237
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,759
what they are yeah

238
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:09,958
and then with a lighter we would heat it

239
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,719
up and it would start boiling

240
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:16,319
and we would smoke it like that

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,620
and so I brought it to some clubs in San

242
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,980
Francisco and Oakland and Berkeley

243
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:26,159
and they were like I don't know this is

244
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,580
just it's too crack-like they love the

245
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,980
product right you know they loved it and

246
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:36,839
so at the time I was offering it to them

247
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,759
for fifty dollars a gram okay and you

248
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,080
know they enjoyed smoking it with me but

249
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,580
they were just like you know this is a

250
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,320
medicinal club and this looks too much

251
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,180
like crack and it doesn't give us the

252
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,120
right box I use tools that are weird

253
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,620
with it yeah so what we did

254
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,240
was

255
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,620
you know one day I'm like thinking I'm

256
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,620
like what the [ __ ] am I gonna do with

257
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,179
this [ __ ] nobody wants it I made it I

258
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,240
didn't know what to do with it

259
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:05,278
and so I had some trim

260
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,560
and I got some of this goopy extract and

261
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,439
I started just pressing the trim into

262
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:13,559
the extract until it would accept no

263
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:18,240
more and so it was basically like

264
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:20,219
at least 75 trim being held together by

265
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,379
a little bit of extract

266
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,759
Moon Rock and I brought I brought this

267
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,559
to the clubs

268
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,278
and you could just rip a little piece

269
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,518
off

270
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,740
stick it in a pipe and smoke it

271
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,720
and they freaked out can you tell me

272
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,278
your first experience smoking that stuff

273
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,440
the first time you ever went from

274
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,899
smoking flour to smoking something that

275
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,399
strong so I actually had been smoking

276
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,480
oils way prior to that because

277
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,179
um

278
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,200
I knew people who were bringing oil back

279
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:54,838
from Jamaica and this is like in the 80s

280
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,579
oh we want to hear this they would bring

281
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,820
back

282
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:01,859
um green honey oil and clear honey oil

283
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,500
in like

284
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,079
um what is it called shampoo bottles

285
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,320
yeah you know with like bags inside and

286
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:12,599
you know this stuff made it and we used

287
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,240
to just get joints and just coat the

288
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,420
outside of them and just [ __ ] make it

289
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,940
super disgusting but that was my first

290
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,338
experience in smoking

291
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,620
concentrates and I don't know how the

292
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:30,360
Jamaican honey oil was made I'm certain

293
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,919
it wasn't from uh from BHO I think they

294
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,259
were using things like the iso2

295
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:38,838
extractor if you remember that they look

296
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,838
like a spaceship like had tears

297
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:45,778
I I some isomerizer too yeah something

298
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:46,500
like that yeah that makes sense

299
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:49,019
um

300
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,559
but yeah so that was the first time I

301
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,360
ever smoked concentrate was in the 80s

302
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,000
um that type of stuff

303
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,680
but so when I brought this my favorite

304
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,860
part of the story is

305
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:04,199
I brought them the pure oil like the

306
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,778
best quality concentrate they had ever

307
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,579
seen to that point and they they were

308
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,578
just like ah I don't know how to deal

309
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:13,919
with this I brought them stuff that I

310
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:17,458
put trash in you know I literally just

311
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,319
put as much trim on it as it would

312
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,879
possibly like I knew it was done when

313
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,560
the trim would just fall off and not

314
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,200
stick to it anymore

315
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,759
and I brought it to them and they were

316
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,060
buying it for me 50 bucks a grams

317
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,200
selling it for 100 bucks a gram and we

318
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,179
made like

319
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,160
you know like I said at first we got to

320
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,719
spot it to them because you know but

321
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,838
after a while they were buying this [ __ ]

322
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,459
and I was the only one making like

323
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,240
nobody knew

324
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:47,039
how to make this [ __ ] yeah so no it was

325
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,139
funny because we would now now it's like

326
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,419
extracts and concentrates are such a big

327
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,399
part of the market and I remember being

328
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,799
in clubs with Gabby like trying to

329
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,799
convince the owners and the buyers like

330
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,899
what it was that it worked you know

331
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,278
getting like and then the other part is

332
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,200
Gabby do you remember I can't remember

333
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,860
what the name of it was but Gabby found

334
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,040
this this container place in Santa Rosa

335
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,919
that like sold all kinds of different

336
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,838
weird sizes of little plastic containers

337
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,039
of all shapes

338
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,240
huh TAP plastics TAP Plastic see because

339
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,219
we were at the first we were like what

340
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,980
do we even put this stuff in yeah like

341
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,720
we didn't even know

342
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,039
on containers that you know you could

343
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,040
scrape it off and stuff like that

344
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,720
like styles of like rectangles and

345
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,060
cylinders and different little things

346
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,800
and we experimented with like which one

347
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,539
was accessible and which one we could

348
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,399
actually get it into and play with

349
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:55,500
because it was like we didn't have any

350
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,480
packaging we didn't know what to do with

351
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,039
it I remember and we used to sit there

352
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,019
like you know and it's like in the open

353
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,879
blast air or whatever you have cases of

354
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,399
butane and then you're like got these

355
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,500
PVC tubes and I remember being on

356
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,299
Gabby's porch because it took you know

357
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,820
it took hours sometimes just to get

358
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,740
prepped and pack all the tubes with all

359
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,879
the you know the Smalls and the trim and

360
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,560
the whatnot

361
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,720
and then you know you start off with

362
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,159
like these smooth PVC tubes and after

363
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,420
you've used them for a while you stick

364
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,799
your finger in there and you rub it

365
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:26,759
around and you realize that it's like

366
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,759
not smooth anymore and we were like oh

367
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,659
oh

368
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:36,720
[ __ ] years later

369
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:38,000
maybe that wasn't the best idea no you

370
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,139
know and yeah

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,440
give me a second

372
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,419
yeah but it was okay I'll talk it was

373
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,699
funny in the sense that like as we were

374
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:49,379
talking earlier on you know earlier

375
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:51,958
recording about how when we were making

376
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:54,240
seeds there wasn't really the industry

377
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,539
or the like all the stuff set up around

378
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,180
to sell seed yeah it was very much like

379
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:02,399
that with BHO oh yeah like the only

380
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,859
thing that people had in shops back then

381
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,720
was like a few kinds of water hash yeah

382
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,600
I remember that very well and there

383
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,278
wasn't that era there wasn't Nails there

384
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,339
wasn't heating elements there wasn't

385
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:18,480
bangers there wasn't like specific rigs

386
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:21,360
to smoke hash out of some of the rigs

387
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,620
um you know like were I mean I don't

388
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,199
know if I don't know if you remember I

389
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,419
won't say his full name but you remember

390
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:30,179
Gabby e had that had that water that

391
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,338
bong that like opened up

392
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,739
you know so you could like it was like

393
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,540
it like had like a like a lampshade

394
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,759
looking thing on the bottom of it and

395
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:40,500
you could put it over when he lived in

396
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,100
the Sebastopol house and you could put

397
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:48,198
it over the the burning coil and you

398
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,459
could drop dabs on it you know

399
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:52,859
I have a I have a question for both of

400
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:55,439
you because this is before my time but

401
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,060
it's something I watched as a kid and I

402
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,459
never understood it and I've never

403
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,500
really asked my dad what the hell it was

404
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,659
yeah and since you worked at a head shop

405
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,000
and you know all this stuff he had a

406
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,699
bamboo bong I think it was

407
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,439
and he would take my Play-Doh and stick

408
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,058
it on the [ __ ] all around it and

409
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,980
I would get so mad and I didn't know

410
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:15,539
looking back I can't figure out why he

411
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,740
stole my Plato for his bamboo bong

412
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,720
because his bong wouldn't have gotten

413
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,240
hot well as a kid I figured oh it must

414
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,640
be getting hot he's Jamaicans Jamaicans

415
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,798
had these bamboo style pipes that they

416
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,839
would use yeah you know I could forget

417
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,819
their technical name and then I can't

418
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,099
remember the name either but like on on

419
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:34,980
Dead shows and stuff there was all this

420
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,538
art it was what was what was that Clay

421
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,380
Art Gabby do you remember what it was

422
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:39,240
called

423
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,280
but they would form it into like little

424
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,140
Jerry heads or like different little

425
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,460
people you know different types of

426
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,720
things and they could you know it would

427
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,720
like Harden over time

428
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,200
an artist could easily turn it into a

429
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,940
pipe and a piece of art at the same time

430
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,240
it was something that like you could do

431
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,759
while you're driving home you know yeah

432
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,558
without like a lot of equipment or it's

433
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,538
like you can't have a glass studio while

434
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,940
you're driving to the next show

435
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:07,980
maybe maybe people would be funny to

436
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,360
hear this but like definitely the first

437
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,160
time I did and it's probably the first

438
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,579
time Gabby did was probably the first

439
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,860
time that you ever saw glass was like uh

440
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,619
Bob's Snodgrass blowing like you know

441
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:22,019
and having his van and and selling it at

442
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,439
shows he did it right on the Grateful

443
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,440
Dead lot

444
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:31,558
because everybody smoked out of stone or

445
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,200
clay or metal or wood or plastic or

446
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:36,298
whatever and so you know I remember

447
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,220
Gabby joking later on that like you know

448
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,379
Bob's stuff looked like it was made by a

449
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,400
kid kind of in certain ways but like at

450
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,460
the time

451
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,500
like it was the only you know he had

452
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,319
like Gabby had like a couple cases of

453
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,319
just Bob work you know a classic skull

454
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:54,538
with a top hat pipe you know I just put

455
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,819
it away but I have a chem dog piece and

456
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:58,740
I got him to blow the only piece that

457
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:01,019
doesn't look like a bob Snodgrass hippie

458
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,240
piece with uh hippie milliflory and he

459
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,220
put in punk rock milliflory for me in

460
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,500
this little 20. there used to be like

461
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,538
this Gabby had like the height of what

462
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,940
was the coolest thing for hippies to

463
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:15,298
have back then which was he had this big

464
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:18,779
Steamroller that Bob with a full Dragon

465
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:20,519
Inside the tube and like as the bowl as

466
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,558
you smoked it it would pull the smoke

467
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,538
down through the dragon head and blow it

468
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,178
out the dragon's mouth and then you

469
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,579
would suck it through the steamroller it

470
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,400
wouldn't fill the pipe with smoke it

471
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:34,439
would make like a straight line Trail to

472
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,660
yours and so it was like a clear

473
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,000
Steamroller but then it had this worked

474
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,919
dragon's head with all like these flares

475
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,038
and colors and stuff

476
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,720
and this is uh made by someone in our

477
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:46,980
group so I'll plug it while we're doing

478
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,519
this

479
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,140
uh but it was just it was it was

480
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,519
literally like that was the only place

481
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,840
in the beginning where we knew how to

482
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,298
get glass

483
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:01,199
and then and then it expanded to like

484
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:02,759
apprentices and Friends of Bob you know

485
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,679
um that learned and there was like a

486
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,200
group in Eugene and stuff like that that

487
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,900
was doing it but

488
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,279
um yeah but people didn't we didn't when

489
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,600
we were making the hash and the other

490
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,940
thing that was funny is like we were

491
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,339
making the hash out of like you know

492
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,620
trim and Smalls from the dog and like

493
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,839
our super dog experiments and the super

494
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:24,599
skunk and stuff and so there was

495
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,418
definitely a few experiences where we

496
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,000
weren't used to the THC content and it

497
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,799
was a little bit of Panic at the Disco

498
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,419
sure you know because you're like you

499
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,038
smoke weed with your friends and you

500
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,660
didn't realize how little you needed to

501
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,879
get lit up

502
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,880
and we would smoke a little bit too much

503
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,919
and get nervous yeah the first time I

504
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,140
smoked uh moon rocks what we were

505
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,340
talking about I'm doing this yeah it's

506
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,020
fine

507
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,519
um I was I didn't know if you wanted me

508
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:54,058
to bring it up or whatever but literally

509
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:57,720
that was that was 2000 or 2001 because

510
00:20:54,058 --> 00:21:01,918
he as soon as he opened the shop he quit

511
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,620
um but we did a lot of it in 2000 2001

512
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,240
and at least amongst our friend group

513
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:08,038
and at least amongst going to the stores

514
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,440
and stuff like that like none of the

515
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:12,359
owners they'd never seen it

516
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,980
they'd never they had no idea what it

517
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:16,558
was they had no idea how to use it they

518
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,660
had no idea how to Market it you know it

519
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,579
was like they were concerned it was

520
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,620
almost like they had to get some of it

521
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,659
and give some to customers and get good

522
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,899
feedback and then they got excited about

523
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,900
it

524
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:36,600
so I don't know you know it uh

525
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:39,839
and there wasn't that many stores really

526
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:42,658
there was a few in Oakland like uh Gabby

527
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,639
was saying there was the third floor

528
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,620
um there was a place that our buddy

529
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,000
owned who I'll remain nameless at the

530
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,219
moment

531
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,339
um there was a place in Berkeley on

532
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,538
Shattuck Avenue and they were uh and

533
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:57,959
they were they were pretty cool because

534
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:59,759
they were punk rock and they were like

535
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,279
it was like where the anarchists Met to

536
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,879
plan like like social resistance yeah

537
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:07,619
and so they didn't make any money off of

538
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,960
their they were like full medical they

539
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:13,678
didn't make any money they made like a a

540
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,140
15 markup to pay for costs and employee

541
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,820
salaries and stuff yeah so like if you

542
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,320
gave them a screaming deal you could go

543
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,899
up and see it on the board and it would

544
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,418
literally be 15 more expensive than what

545
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,980
you gave it to them for yeah where

546
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,659
everybody else was like doubling or

547
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,120
tripling their money or whatever on it

548
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:32,159
it was definitely semi-profit based they

549
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,719
were literally like just the overhead to

550
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,760
run the place

551
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,058
you know do you remember that spot on

552
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,038
Shattuck Gabby that we would go to

553
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:42,480
they were so different than the rest of

554
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:46,019
them because they literally were like

555
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,298
you know beautiful there we go no they

556
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:50,960
were punk rock they're very punk rock

557
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,960
about it

558
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm sure

559
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,038
see

560
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't know how good you guys can see

561
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,000
that

562
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,900
what is it what do we have this is the

563
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,900
orangutan titties

564
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:23,600
the worst slash best names in cannabis

565
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:26,399
right super boof yeah that is

566
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,678
I am not familiar with orangutan titties

567
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,919
yeah no that's a new one to me so it's

568
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:35,460
Grease Monkeys time Skittles

569
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,100
um do you know Parker Francis yeah did

570
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:42,480

573
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:51,119
in the personal use category with this

574
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,859
genetic

575
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,939
and this is one of the ones that I got

576
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:57,779
at the nursery

577
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,820
but uh rolling some up

578
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,700
I'm not driving today as you guys can

579
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:05,339
tell yeah

580
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm able to imbibe a little bit more

581
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:11,099
but we so at the time too that we were

582
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:13,859
making it we were concerned about

583
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:16,319
Mike uh you know

584
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:18,298
fire or whatever but like we took such

585
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,619
extreme precautions like because we were

586
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,918
out literally in the middle of a field

587
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:25,619
and like we would heat the water far

588
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,419
away and then bring it you know and and

589
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:29,219
do the thing like we didn't do like what

590
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,140
people did later with electrical or try

591
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,079
to do it in garages or try to do it into

592
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,759
a shed or anywhere it could build up you

593
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,859
know so we never had any of like the

594
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,400
horror stories of like

595
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:45,719
you know accidents really

596
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,580
I mean we could have like we didn't yeah

597
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,339
I mean again

598
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:53,819
don't attempt this at home bad you know

599
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:56,099
stupid things that young people do when

600
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:58,259
you don't know better

601
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:59,579
but you know it was like at the time it

602
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:02,640
was like I don't even we'd never even

603
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:04,980
heard the term BHO it was basically just

604
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,900
like a situation where like whoever

605
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,700
taught Gabby I can't even remember his

606
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,038
name what

607
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,480
I don't remember what we call it

608
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,119
I don't remember what we called it

609
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,798
either but but we it was like he was

610
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,379
like dude it's like you can pack this

611
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,679
tube full of Smalls and like small nugs

612
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,840
and trim and it'll melt all the THC

613
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,940
right off it and then collect it in this

614
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:29,038
thing and you'll turn all this stuff

615
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,159
that you just sit around anyway and uh

616
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,259
gold

617
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:37,320
and you know it was the first time we'd

618
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,298
ever seen it yeah and Gabby definitely

619
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:43,379
Gabby taught it to me and then we ended

620
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:45,119
up doing it together and uh

621
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,419
um that's gonna be clipped right there

622
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,619
that that statement that was awesome

623
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,620
that you guys ended up doing it together

624
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,640
also getting clicked like saying awkward

625
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,179
out of context

626
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:06,320
with this product let me see what is it

627
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:09,620
I can't see it I'm blind there's

628
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:13,678
King Palms

629
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:17,579
no yeah so this is a product that I

630
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,679
really like let's see they make it's

631
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:21,740
like a

632
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,538
it's like a cone

633
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:28,380
yeah no I have seen those it's made out

634
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:30,658
of a palm leaf yeah and so I don't smoke

635
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,700
blunts there was somebody on the Discord

636
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,419
talking about how you know they're gonna

637
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,960
smoke blunts till they die

638
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:42,059
because I don't smoke tobacco yeah and I

639
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,940
think it really just

640
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:46,440
like you have a beautiful flower and

641
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,558
then you put you know roll it with

642
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,000
tobacco it's kind of [ __ ] up yeah I

643
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,700
was skeptical about these I bought these

644
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,740
for my lady as an alternative to Blunts

645
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,960
and they're really thick you think that

646
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,859
they're gonna burn like really hot and

647
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,720
like

648
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:01,678
but man these things actually burn

649
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,240
better

650
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,200
than papers you know like uh what are

651
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,058
the

652
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,058
just depict raws

653
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,538
because they're [ __ ] harsh they burn

654
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,759
so fast too

655
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,619
these

656
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,879
um they have this little thing you don't

657
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,000
have to use it you can just fill it by

658
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,278
hand right drop the joint in there

659
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,259
and you give it a little

660
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,259
coke with the supplied poker

661
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:36,599
put a little bit more in there and I can

662
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:39,359
actually roll a joint but like I cannot

663
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,819
I can't I can roll a joint I mean I used

664
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,099
to use rolling machines just to like

665
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:46,500
do a better job and make it faster

666
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:47,879
because like we said in yesterday I

667
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,400
would do like 10 you know in the morning

668
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,778
before I left for work yeah but this

669
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,559
thing

670
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:58,500
what you get is such an elegant product

671
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:00,839
and you really can taste the weed really

672
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,940
good in it you'll see it in a minute so

673
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,379
maybe this is a good segue I just

674
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,320
thought about it while you were chatting

675
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,559
where uh when when Gabby and I became

676
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:15,439
friends uh like a lot of hippies uh we

677
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:19,200
were Club paper uh you know exclusives

678
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,360
various sizes of clubs uh not modianos

679
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,100
or whatever yeah all kinds of different

680
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,359
sizes depends on what you're rolling

681
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:26,879
whether you're rolling a thumb size

682
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:29,939
joint or a Pinner or whatever but

683
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,340
I didn't have a pallet to do it but

684
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:36,058
Gabby could straight up

685
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:38,399
taste glue there we go right and nobody

686
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:40,099
would believe nobody would believe that

687
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,419
he could actually taste the difference

688
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:43,980
so I don't know how many times it

689
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,620
happened but it happened numerous times

690
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,740
where like we would literally blindfold

691
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:52,918
Gabby and people would roll joints of

692
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,440
the exact same weed and one would have

693
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:59,480
glue and one wooden and he'd take a

694
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,480
couple puffs and and he'd be like glue

695
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,379
not glue and he was a hundred percent

696
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,700
right every single time and people be

697
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,020
like there's no way you can tell the

698
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,240
difference dude I don't believe it he's

699
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:10,379
like

700
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,839
just told the difference

701
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,580
huh I think they would have been able to

702
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,980
tell the difference like when you have

703
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:19,678
like eight quality herb like like the

704
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,259
chem dog that has such a good taste and

705
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,820
then just smoking glue like I think

706
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,960
you're gonna be able to say that one's

707
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:26,819
better

708
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,340
yeah people would not believe that he

709
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:31,379
could do it and I honestly my palate I

710
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:33,538
couldn't taste it but Gabby learned what

711
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,299
the flavor of the glue was

712
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:38,460
and he got it right 100 of the time he

713
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:42,179
could he could taste glue and so we

714
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:45,538
never smoked papers with glue because he

715
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:48,179
felt like it ruined the the J so we

716
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:50,339
always smoked rice glueless rice papers

717
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,419
that you had to rip and lick in order to

718
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:53,819
get them to stick

719
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,380
which was mostly before Club kind of

720
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:58,379
went out of business or whatever it was

721
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,080
all clubs that was the that was the

722
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,778
heady hippie paper that was the

723
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,678
acceptable paper for heady joints I'm

724
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:06,679
gonna grab an ashtray

725
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,240
was uh was the clubs

726
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:13,740
yeah you know I was just showing those

727
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,359
things are so hard to use without the

728
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,038
gummed thing like I don't get how you're

729
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,719
supposed to get the papers to like

730
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,700
intertwine it was the only kind of

731
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,200
joints that he would roll you know

732
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,819
that's all our friends in our group or

733
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,538
whatever like you basically you have to

734
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:29,819
rip it so that the fibers you know are

735
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:32,579
rough and then you have to apply it you

736
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:34,500
know but yeah John tried to show me oops

737
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:36,178
he tried to show me how to do that and I

738
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,740
was like I'm watching it right there in

739
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:41,100
front of me and I'm like what the [ __ ]

740
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,558
yeah no glue was glue was subpar in our

741
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:45,599
in our crew glue was glue you know you

742
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:47,519
didn't use glue was cheating since

743
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,898
Francis talks a lot in his dick I'll go

744
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,940
ahead and do this again and plug our

745
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:54,298
friend uh

746
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,179
Gabby have you heard of C2 last before

747
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,440
they're pretty good they're pretty fast

748
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:59,899
I'm pretty sure I can get him to send

749
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,399
you something cool

750
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:05,398
if they want to sponsor me I'm accepting

751
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,479
the Box okay I'm sure he'd be down to

752
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:08,219
send you something cool he's in our

753
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,419
group

754
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,220
go ahead

755
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:15,480
I'll show you what I'm smoking out of

756
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,519
let's see this is called slow scientific

757
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,538
glass

758
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,619
and very scientific has no color in it

759
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:27,419
at all it's mostly just about function

760
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:29,759
and like the water will come up to here

761
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:32,580
and like do like a circle

762
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,579
uh-huh like a recycler

763
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:38,579
yes it is a recycler

764
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:40,740
and I've had this bong since the

765
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:42,778
beginning of a

766
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:46,019
uh of me dabbing many years ago luckily

767
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,819
this one this one made it wow that's a

768
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,278
beautiful one

769
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:52,859
I just brought home my uh ski mask last

770
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:55,619
piece It's A Clockwork Orange one that I

771
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:58,879
left it my mother's for like a long time

772
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:58,879
never been used though

773
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,419
so people are going to want us to cover

774
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,960
sour and clop more thoroughly

775
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,759
like that's a great era of your life

776
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,558
and I don't think we've covered it

777
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,658
properly the answer you know discuss

778
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,298
this and stuff but I've been thinking

779
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,460
about this a lot sure and so I I just

780
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:18,359
want to get this out out there into the

781
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,798
open

782
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:23,519
and

783
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:26,099
with all due respect to the people that

784
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,798
are obsessing about this topic

785
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:30,178
including you

786
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:31,859
um

787
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,659
like

788
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:35,099
because people are like well people are

789
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:38,820
going to get pissed off you're gonna get

790
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:40,918
angry text messages and I'm like I don't

791
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:43,379
think so but

792
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,299
the fact that anyone is getting that

793
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:50,520
worked up about something

794
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:53,220
that is we can't even prove it and

795
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,319
it's just silly I mean we should enjoy

796
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,538
the conversation you know everybody

797
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:00,658
should be enjoying the conversation and

798
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:01,740
like you know debating if necessary but

799
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,140
like

800
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,880
for anyone to get uptight or threatened

801
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,520
or

802
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,640
you know feel wrong if I say something

803
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:15,418
that's completely false because

804
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,778
you know happened 30 years ago and

805
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:20,399
you know my brain any of them are

806
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:22,339
welcome to come on and correct it you

807
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,959
know what I mean like this is

808
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:26,699
like it doesn't even have to be like

809
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,019
that you know like they don't have to

810
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,558
correct they don't have to want to

811
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:32,880
correct themselves and you know like you

812
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:37,200
know it's just like

813
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,080
this is what one stoned aging hippie is

814
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,380
saying right it doesn't mean that much

815
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,418
right yeah

816
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,820
let's just consider it good stories that

817
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:51,480
we can all enjoy and laugh about and try

818
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:52,558
to like pull from you know because you

819
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,899
know

820
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,220
I don't remember who said it and no but

821
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:58,558
you know somebody said that you know

822
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:02,640
Greg has changed his story a few times

823
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:06,000
and so like he's not really the best

824
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:09,419
source of or reliable

825
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,440
let's just for give him the benefit of

826
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,838
the doubt

827
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,260
that he smokes a lot of weed and he's

828
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:18,059
just sold and he never remembered the

829
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,300
story that good because he's you know

830
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:23,960
but like if he was a kid he's not a liar

831
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,960
you know

832
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:30,299
and and if we all remember it a little

833
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,179
bit differently

834
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,039
I think that's what we call perspective

835
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,619
perspective and

836
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,639
and not only perspective but just flawed

837
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,320
memory

838
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,780
you know the other part of it I just

839
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,700
wanted to start by saying that like

840
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,760
nobody should be getting all worked up

841
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:50,759
about anything that we say I hope people

842
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,980
enjoy the conversation

843
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,500
um you know one thing that you said to

844
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,599
me yesterday Matt is that you know you

845
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,679
like the way Francis and I talk you know

846
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,800
I mean

847
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,879
Francis has been my friend for over 20

848
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,240
years

849
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,740
and talking to him like for instance

850
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,739
if I was just talking to you

851
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,460
it might not be exactly the same just

852
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:16,500
because you know what I mean like yeah

853
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,358
not that I wouldn't be open with you or

854
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,800
anything but there's no way you guys

855
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:25,940
you know something else that I wanted to

856
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,460
say is that you know

857
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,960
nothing like terrible like but like some

858
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,920
awkward [ __ ] happened with me and

859
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,900
Francis

860
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,079
okay I'm just gonna get it out in the

861
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,440
open my X fired him

862
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,060
okay like and

863
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,240
he was like one of the most valuable

864
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:47,279
people that ever worked for me you know

865
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,159
like I told people that

866
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,300
you know he I felt like I could really

867
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,219
help people

868
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:57,359
and Francis was actually able to help

869
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:58,980
people even more you know and so today I

870
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,259
you know I I'm pretty sure I did in the

871
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,900
past I'll say it again I'm sorry that

872
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,780
that happened it was a total mistake and

873
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,280
bad business wasn't my decision uh you

874
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,200
know my business was slowing down like

875
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,820
when we hired Francis our business was

876
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,939
booming and we were able to pay people

877
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,039
what Francis needed to make and then as

878
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,220
business got not as good

879
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,960
you know got harder to do that

880
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:24,059
um but the point is like me and Francis

881
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,119
didn't talk for a while for that and

882
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:30,719
maybe some other petty [ __ ] and me and

883
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,780
VA skunk didn't talk for a few years

884
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,399
over again

885
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,040
[ __ ] that like

886
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,240
it shouldn't keep people that are as

887
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:41,219
connected

888
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:44,479
as we are

889
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:46,559
to to not talk you know and I had this

890
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,760
Epiphany or like I don't know if

891
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,679
Tiffany's the right word but this

892
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,680
thought like when I recently connected

893
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:56,460
with VA again I was like you know

894
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:59,699
I really don't give a [ __ ] about any of

895
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:03,240
the stuff that happened in our past

896
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:06,919
like any of the times that we argued

897
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,919
and because

898
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,219
you know I said to him I said I love you

899
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,199
you're an important part of my life

900
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:15,358
important part of my history

901
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,699
and I don't want to let that [ __ ] go and

902
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,440
so I want to say it's exactly the same

903
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:22,139
for me

904
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,380
and Francis like

905
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:29,098
I love this guy you know I always will

906
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:31,500
you know and as you get older

907
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,640
you know you just start to realize that

908
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,380
like

909
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,118
these are the things that are important

910
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,820
not like

911
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:44,160
what the exact Cross of

912
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:48,300
sour and you know chem made you know

913
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:49,920
it's like yeah that [ __ ] is just like

914
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,480
stuff that we should definitely discuss

915
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,940
I'm not saying it's not worth a

916
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,260
discussion and like let's think about it

917
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,059
I mean like that's what me and Francis

918
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,700
used to do all the time anyway we used

919
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,858
to talk about weed right but yeah it

920
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,618
sounds like it anyone to get upset and

921
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:08,098
feel threatened about like

922
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:12,000
this topic that involves [ __ ] that like

923
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:14,820
I don't I don't and won't understand it

924
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,039
so going into this topic about this hour

925
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:20,420
which I have even less

926
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:23,279
exact information about than yeah sure

927
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:26,579
like we're just speculating

928
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,859
you know like maybe maybe I'll interject

929
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:33,359
too and say yeah tell me about me too

930
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:36,480
well I mean what's interesting is that

931
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,219
you you know I mean you know uh Gabby

932
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,079
and I were were chatting I think it was

933
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:41,639
last night or something and like we were

934
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,859
going over some stuff that we won't be

935
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,900
chatting about but you know it's just

936
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:48,480
it's hard in life there's so many twists

937
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,400
and turns and there's so many like Gabby

938
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,619
was like you know Life's a carnival

939
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,740
and you know you have this situation

940
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:57,420
where people get you know like I try to

941
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,039
tell history and I and you know he

942
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,380
mentioned that I tried to be as accurate

943
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,539
as possible but I also admit things

944
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,460
because you have these situations where

945
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:07,980
you have friends that have been friends

946
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,780
for 20 or 30 years and they have ins and

947
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,358
outs with each other and their lives

948
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,220
have complications and it's like that's

949
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:15,779
not really pertinent to the story so

950
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,759
much and it's like it's not really

951
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,180
people's business and like I wasn't

952
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,420
going to go into like obviously you know

953
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:26,639
I see Collective skunk VA Gabby myself

954
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,880
we've all known each other for like a

955
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,460
really long time you know like really at

956
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,079
this point a really long time and so

957
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,358
there's ins and outs and ups and downs

958
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,660
and and fallouts and fall ins to all

959
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:41,880
that kind of stuff that you know and and

960
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:44,759
uh and our you know and just how that's

961
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,320
how life works right and so you know

962
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,960
people always want to latch on to the

963
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,320
salacious part of it to some degree or

964
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,940
the part that creates conflict and you

965
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,559
know it's funny too because people would

966
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,659
attack me for being like oh you don't

967
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,759
really know that and really it's like

968
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:02,639
I would be like dude all my stories come

969
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,440
honestly from like my one friend

970
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,960
and I don't know how to prove to you how

971
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,579
good of friends we were but like we were

972
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,579
really good friends [ __ ] friends

973
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:18,239
me and Francis were good [ __ ] friends

974
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,519
and and like the stories he told seemed

975
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,779
to be fairly accurate like nothing that

976
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,420
I could uh

977
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,040
argue with and you know like yeah we sat

978
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,780
the amount of times we sat on a couch

979
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,539
together and smoked joints and talked

980
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,300
[ __ ] about weed or like made BHO or

981
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:34,559
bread or traded like I mean it was just

982
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,420
like people don't realize what a

983
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,880
different era it was

984
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,740
you know and so

985
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,920
um people want to jump on little points

986
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:46,379
you know in that regard but you know

987
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,920
between the four or five of us or

988
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:52,260
whatever and you go back 20 25 years

989
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,900
like like homie said you're gonna have

990
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,119
some different memories and on top of

991
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,039
that it's not like when the chem dog

992
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,599
story was getting written or the sour

993
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,179
story was getting written or any of this

994
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,940
stuff was happening any of us knew any

995
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:07,139
of this was going to be important later

996
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,960
on

997
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:12,118
you had a bunch of partying hippies who

998
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,740
like to see shows and like to go out and

999
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,039
like to stay up late and like to smoke

1000
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:18,959
weed and all that doing stuff and then

1001
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,358
later on people are like oh man that was

1002
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,940
kind of important we want to know

1003
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:25,920
specifics yeah like play by play and so

1004
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,500
you try to give you the most accurate

1005
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,780
play-by-play and then if two people have

1006
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,480
a different play-by-play it doesn't mean

1007
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,040
that someone's lying it just means that

1008
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,740
their memory map is a little different

1009
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:39,239
maybe or what's stuck in their head is a

1010
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:42,539
bit different

1011
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:43,919
you know I think sometimes also

1012
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:47,400
like

1013
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,338
because I believe the story the way I do

1014
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,960
and you believe the story that the way

1015
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:54,000
you do

1016
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,119
when we talk

1017
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,119
we can like

1018
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,099
we're not trying to convince any it's

1019
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:05,460
like this is actually what we believe

1020
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:07,440
right yeah so like we're not lying

1021
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,059
I'm not wording it properly but the

1022
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,700
whole point is it's just

1023
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:13,019
this is the story as we remember it

1024
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:16,799
like

1025
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:18,539
I'd be happy for someone to like help me

1026
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,300
remember it better

1027
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:24,838
because I want to know the truth too

1028
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:26,460
you know like and and you know like it

1029
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:27,838
took me a minute to remember the like

1030
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,900
breeding stuff that we did together

1031
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:33,539
Francis you know and I was like oh yeah

1032
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,160
of course I mean like where did I get

1033
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:37,800
all that [ __ ] from

1034
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:41,098
you know like I got a lot of genetics

1035
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,320
from you you know like the Maui you had

1036
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:46,079
gotten that from Jason King right

1037
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,400
no we got that from uh like that was

1038
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,980
that was some of the first weed I ever

1039
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,599
grew Shawn and I grew that in Chicago oh

1040
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,039
that's right what was the wee doing here

1041
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,500
from Jason Kingman didn't we get a

1042
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,639
strained from him the mothership the

1043
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,619
mothership right

1044
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,639
yeah

1045
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:04,559
because I've heard of pineapple mother

1046
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,358
[ __ ] but never another [ __ ] that

1047
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,099
remember that story I told you about the

1048
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:09,299
the weed that got mailed to us the

1049
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:11,160
plants and we thought they were going to

1050
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,519
send us cuttings and the chick sent us

1051
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:15,179
like plants and two gallon pots yeah

1052
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:16,338
yeah yes

1053
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:18,659
[Music]

1054
00:43:16,338 --> 00:43:20,519
she got the mothership and it was

1055
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:22,920
actually at one of Eddie lepp's house

1056
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,780
that it got sent to that's fun that he

1057
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,059
had not not his main property where he

1058
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,400
grew but like uh Jason was renting a

1059
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:31,259
house from him in Lake County and they

1060
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,000
sent us that dude it was it was such a

1061
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,640
big box when I opened it up I almost

1062
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,440
[ __ ] my pants because it was literally

1063
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:41,098
like two plants that were two feet tall

1064
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,179
with bamboo steaks in soil but I thought

1065
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,039
they were going to send like little

1066
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:45,598
cuttings like in rockwool or something

1067
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,900
I've had that happen a few times it's

1068
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,359
weird these two giant ass plants

1069
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,800
you know and communication is off a

1070
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:56,039
little bit on that

1071
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,619
we uh but yeah uh you know the the Maui

1072
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,679
got brought out by uh John and I yeah

1073
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:05,338
and so then it was also the Mendocino

1074
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:09,480
perps yeah you know like I had the chem

1075
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:12,000
dogs and you know the super dog uh you

1076
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,818
know the uh the skunk

1077
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,280
and you had all these other strains

1078
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:20,039
you know like I didn't have that diverse

1079
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,660
of the collection that you did no you

1080
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:23,659
had a couple things but they were really

1081
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:26,279
good things

1082
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:28,318
when I think about it's like oh yeah all

1083
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,140
that all those other strains that we

1084
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:33,059
crossed you know with the stuff that you

brought in you know yeah whether it was

1086

flour oh [ __ ] oh my God now I'm going to

1106
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,099
start [ __ ] on the Discord everyone's

1107
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,099
gotta like make memes and [ __ ]

1108
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,599
dog flour because I haven't had any in a

1109
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,019
really long time

1110
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,900
honestly I I told Matt you did a really

1111
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:53,818
good job you did a far better job than I

1112
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,519
would have you've been thinking about it

1113
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:59,579
a lot more than I have and you know so

1114
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:03,659
you know there was little details that

1115
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:06,180
honestly don't really matter that much

1116
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:09,299
you know the core of the story was

1117
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:11,699
correct like one little detail that you

1118
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:15,300
got wrong was the only reason why I got

1119
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:17,879
the chem dog was because I gave

1120
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:20,220
um Greg the skunk

1121
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,539
like you know he didn't want to give it

1122
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:22,858
to me until I had something that he

1123
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:25,079
wanted

1124
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:26,880
you know and

1125
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,720
so

1126
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,000
um

1127
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,379
but like I said the details was so

1128
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,940
little

1129
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,619
you know that

1130
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,119
I mean you can by all means ask

1131
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,280
questions

1132
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,318
but

1133
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,540
I don't know like I was thinking more

1134
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:47,099
like I could tell a couple of stories

1135
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:49,259
about oh yeah you know like how I got it

1136
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:52,980
across country oh yeah

1137
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,660
um when I met klopp you know when I met

1138
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,818
Greg

1139
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:59,279
I want to tell people when I met like

1140
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:02,519
not just met you but like the moment

1141
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,140
that we became friends for life you know

1142
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,059
because there was that moment

1143
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:10,199
do you remember the moment

1144
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:12,299
I mean I I remember uh so what I

1145
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:15,719
remember what really broke us through in

1146
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:18,539
terms of friendship was Sean and I were

1147
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,279
trying to [ __ ] uh figure out those

1148
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:23,699
water cooled lights

1149
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,019
and they kept for that it was before

1150
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:26,460
that

1151
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:28,920
well actually I don't know if it was

1152
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,358
before that but that wasn't the moment

1153
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,680
for me at least but go ahead you tell

1154
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:32,940
your side they don't tell mine well I

1155
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,279
mean the other part of it too is that

1156
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,619
people have different memories of things

1157
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,599
you know I'm like really I'm losing it

1158
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:40,858
because one is one thing there's certain

1159
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,240
things that I'll never forget but go

1160
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,279
ahead you tell you because I think I

1161
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,559
think we actually became friends when

1162
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,359
you were working at like the first time

1163
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,159
we started talking was when you were at

1164
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:52,159
Slavic Shop

1165
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,318
yeah Hydro Depot

1166
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,940
before when there was no shops in Mendo

1167
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:59,099
or anything like that we had to go south

1168
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,579
in order to get and I mean I remember

1169
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:05,599
going I remember going to uh your house

1170
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,599
in cazadero

1171
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,500
you know

1172
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:12,358
and uh yeah and that's where that's

1173
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,838
where I actually I think that's where we

1174
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:18,480
actually did our first exchange of cuts

1175
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,279
you know uh remember you used to make

1176
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,900
that pasta dude with like all the

1177
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,359
veggies and the olive oil and the

1178
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:28,380
balsamic and all that stuff

1179
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:30,960
and uh yeah it came down you know and uh

1180
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,579
you had you invited me down for dinner

1181
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,159
um but the thing that I was gonna tell

1182
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:38,099
was like we we were leaving after

1183
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:40,739
talking to you one day and Sean was like

1184
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:43,440
we should leave a join a Mendo perps on

1185
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:47,578
his on his windshield wipers

1186
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,500
[Laughter]

1187
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:53,099
you know I could hear him saying that

1188
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,318
right now in his voice

1189
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:56,519
do you know uh this I don't know if this

1190
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:59,099
is gonna be this this should probably

1191
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:02,280
get cut out or whatever dude but

1192
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:06,838
um I reconnected just within the last

1193
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:09,859
month after the years of trying with his

1194
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:09,858
wife and daughter

1195
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,519
whose wife and daughter scones

1196
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:20,219
oh oh that's awesome

1197
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:21,719
yeah his daughter is like going to

1198
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:23,459
college next year

1199
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:25,559
I mean they're pretty good

1200
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,960
wow you know I'll send you pics dude

1201
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:30,960
after this call or whatever like she got

1202
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,199
like she looks so much she looks like a

1203
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,539
much prettier version of Sean

1204
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,578
she's got like

1205
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:42,960
no she's not Paul but she's got his skin

1206
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:44,818
tone like the super like pale Irish how

1207
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,280
about attitude

1208
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:48,838
you know she's nicer

1209
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,700
but

1210
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:52,799
I mean that's the funny thing too is

1211
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:55,919
like Sean was so much like a bunch of my

1212
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,339
friends back home I was the nice one

1213
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,380
you know I was the mellower ones yeah

1214
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:03,619
you know and I think he would have said

1215
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,260
that you were the soft one but

1216
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:08,760
I would say that about him

1217
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:11,579
you know yeah I mean all right so let me

1218
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,680
let me let me tell my story sure I don't

1219
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:16,019
want this edited out okay because I want

1220
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:19,799
this to be live on the internet for

1221
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:23,818
eternity got it all right so Francis and

1222
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:27,180
Sean were customers at my hydro store

1223
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:28,079
okay it was uh called Hydro Depot at the

1224
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:30,118
point

1225
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,039
and um

1226
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,660
you know we're just being casually

1227
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:35,759
friendly I was just trying to provide

1228
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:39,539
good this and be cool and stuff like

1229
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,740
that and I had given you my phone number

1230
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:42,480
and

1231
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:43,919
I don't know if this will this is

1232
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,818
definitely before we started training

1233
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,800
clones

1234
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:49,558
you know but I gave you my phone number

1235
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,760
for some reason and you called me one

1236
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:52,859
night

1237
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,460
and you said Gabby

1238
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:59,098
do you have a part for an airflow oh

1239
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,139
yeah like it's like a part that like

1240
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,579
sticks out on the bottom of the airflow

1241
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:05,879
like to drain it

1242
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:07,619
and somehow you broke yours and for

1243
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,039
those of you that don't know the airflow

1244
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:12,599
is an aeroponic system that if that

1245
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,880
thing's not getting water

1246
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,260
and if what is not pumping through it

1247
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,880
constantly

1248
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,460
your plants are in big trouble fast

1249
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,200
because yeah aeroponics there's no

1250
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,358
median right so the roots are just

1251
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:26,219
dangling in this tube by itself so

1252
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,719
Francis calls me up he's like hey Gabby

1253
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:32,399
I know it's late but we got an emergency

1254
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:34,500
airflow the drain broke off it's not

1255
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,079
holding water you know we're going to

1256
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,358
lose everything and I was like oh well I

1257
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,940
have an airflow at my store you can come

1258
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,558
and get it so I drove over there met

1259
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,838
these guys over there

1260
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,640
and they uh

1261
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,380
you know we open up the box get out the

1262
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,598
part for the airflow

1263
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:54,420
and then you decide well you know since

1264
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,760
we're here there's a couple more things

1265
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,380
that I need and I'm like sure no problem

1266
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,180
at this point like I've already made the

1267
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,059
trip might as well sell you some more

1268
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:05,219
[ __ ] right so you're like grabbing

1269
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,680
things I want this I want this but

1270
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:10,739
you're just holding it in your hand

1271
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,719
and before we know it you drop the

1272
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:16,618
airflow part it's like this

1273
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:18,779
PDC manifold you know like two inch PVC

1274
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:20,760
or one and a half inch PVC it has all

1275
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,660
these things on it and my floor is

1276
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,880
cement

1277
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:25,858
and it was so heavy because of all the

1278
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,019
stuff that was attached to it when it

1279
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:30,119
hit the ground that just shattered oh my

1280
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:33,420
God and it was just like

1281
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,460
oh my God like at that point

1282
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,960
like your crop was [ __ ] I don't

1283
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,099
remember actually what happened but it

1284
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,740
was like

1285
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:42,300
this is bad you know I think like the

1286
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:44,039
next day I think the next day you went

1287
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,619
to like Friedman brothers or something

1288
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:50,039
like that and just got like PVC in the

1289
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:53,579
cap and stuck it in but like your plants

1290
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:55,380
were like not happy with you no it was

1291
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,780
definitely not happiness definitely not

1292
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,519
and and even though it was that moment

1293
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,740
of Sorrow

1294
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,079
that was the moment that I always felt

1295
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:06,558
like we connected and became friends

1296
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,559
forever

1297
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,940
it was funny the part you didn't know

1298
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:18,899
that Sean was walking and he tripped

1299
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:23,780
and uh he found blaming Sean well he

1300
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,780
fell he's [ __ ] dead bro he's dead

1301
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:28,880
and he broke he's a nice guy this is the

1302
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,740
nice guy

1303
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,260
he broke he broke it and then we had to

1304
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:37,199
we had to we had to make it happen oh

1305
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,359
but yeah I mean we came like we came

1306
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:42,358
from Hydro World because coming from

1307
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:45,179
where we came from like soil

1308
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:47,039
working with soil wasn't really like

1309
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,139

first time I ever grew weed please right

1316
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,400
so

1317
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:08,039
my parents

1318
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:12,119
they helped me get this apartment

1319
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:14,639
and it was in Green Point in Brooklyn

1320
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:17,000
which is like a really at the time he's

1321
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:20,338
like an extremely polish neighborhood

1322
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,380
like now it's like super hip it ran all

1323
00:54:20,338 --> 00:54:24,900
the old people out now it's like young

1324
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:28,800
students and stuff like that it's two

1325
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:31,440
stops on the L train from Manhattan so

1326
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,660
you're in Brooklyn but you can be in

1327
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,519
Manhattan in less than five minutes yeah

1328
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:36,539
you know so it's like it's an awesome

1329
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,420
spot

1330
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:41,099
and uh so I got this apartment it was on

1331
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,099
the third story

1332
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:47,160
of this Brownstone

1333
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:49,140
and on every story there was two

1334
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,879
apartments on the bottom story there was

1335
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:52,799
like a card room it's like a private

1336
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,338
card room with these old polish guys

1337
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,760
that play cards then on the Second Story

1338
00:54:56,338 --> 00:55:01,400
there was a gay couple and then like a

1339
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,520
Polish couple that spoke zero English

1340
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:08,579
right and then on the top story it was

1341
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,739
me and my girlfriend at the time

1342
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,839
and

1343
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:15,679
um

1344
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:15,679
uh

1345
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:20,879
that lived next to us that were young

1346
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,818
right so

1347
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,318
I was growing in this apartment and just

1348
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:27,960
like you said

1349
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:29,519
getting rid of soil and stuff and you

1350
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,900
know anything like that it was super

1351
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,579
because

1352
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,599
you had to put all your trash out on the

1353
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,700
street

1354
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,980
you know and if the cops thought you

1355
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:39,838
were growing looking at your trash like

1356
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,179
they don't even need a warrant to do

1357
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,679
that like it's out on the street they

1358
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:45,659
can just go through it

1359
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,818
so

1360
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:50,159
my toilet

1361
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:53,039
I'm on the third story

1362
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:54,058
and there was so much suction on this

1363
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,699
toilet

1364
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,859
like literally you would not sit on it

1365
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:00,239
when you flushed that toilet okay

1366
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:01,920
because [ __ ] your balls that's

1367
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,979
dangerous up down the pipe yeah yeah

1368
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,760
exactly right so but I thought I'd take

1369
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,760
advantage of this

1370
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:12,500
literally

1371
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:16,800
I used to flush everything

1372
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:18,539
the trim the soil everything went down

1373
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,579
the [ __ ] toilet

1374
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:22,019
this is some 90s story right here dude

1375
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:24,359
oh yeah that's what I thought we should

1376
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:28,318
start with this so like I mean I was

1377
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:31,619
growing in like two or three gallon pots

1378
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:33,000
and at the end of the cop uh crop I

1379
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:34,740
would cut the stem

1380
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,358
I don't remember how we got the stems

1381
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:37,739
down the toilet but I I know everything

1382
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:39,420
went down the toilet we must have like

1383
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:41,219
grind it up or something

1384
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,599
and I would just have these five gallon

1385
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:44,098
bucket of soil and I'd turn it over into

1386
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,140
the toilet and then like with a stick

1387
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:48,059
I'd [ __ ] just like break it up and

1388
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:52,199
like one flush it would just go straight

1389
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:52,200
down right and

1390
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,300
I mean I did like two or three crops

1391
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,519
there before I moved to California

1392
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:03,359
and

1393
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:06,599
so one day you know the inevitable day

1394
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:10,380
comes where I stick I stick this five

1395
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:13,440
gallon bucket into the toilet

1396
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:14,760
it floods the place oh [ __ ] it doesn't

1397
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,940
go down

1398
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,319
and at that moment I'm like oh my God

1399
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,539
like

1400
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:23,338
I gotta call a plumber

1401
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:27,960
and there's gonna be

1402
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:31,380
two crops worth of soil jammed in these

1403
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,480
pipes like you know I'm like I'm so

1404
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,920
busted I'm like thinking like I gotta

1405
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,039
cut down all my [ __ ]

1406
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,920
yeah like this is this is bad like I I

1407
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:42,300
like you know and the place had one

1408
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,700
bathroom

1409
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,440
oh no it's like a railroad apartment

1410
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:47,699
right it was one room to the next room

1411
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,858
to the Next Room

1412
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:51,960
and then there was a kitchen with a

1413
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:53,639
shower right next to it a bathroom that

1414
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,358
was it I used to live in one of those

1415
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,500
okay and uh so this is this is a bad

1416
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,098
situation

1417
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:03,179
so I run to the hardware store and I buy

1418
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:05,220
a plunger

1419
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:07,679
which I never had because

1420
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:11,959
the [ __ ] thing had yeah you know you

1421
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,960
just so I buy a plunger

1422
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,400
flush it and it just [ __ ] goes right

1423
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,400
down

1424
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:21,179
and like

1425
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:24,558
oh my God and I think I continued to

1426
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:24,558
flush it down the toilet because

1427
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,160
what else the [ __ ] was I gonna do

1428
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:32,400
literally yeah there was nothing to do

1429
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:34,799
I'm in New York City like

1430
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,358
because only so many other people's like

1431
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,760
dumpsters that you could dump you know

1432
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:40,259
that's shady too like trying to put your

1433
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,059
[ __ ] in somebody else's dumpster or

1434
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,220
something like that that's what yeah

1435
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:46,500
when I lived in New York I flushed

1436
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:47,699
everything I flushed everything down the

1437
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,858
toilet

1438
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:52,439
that is [ __ ] hilarious I used to live

1439
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:54,480
in a big apartment complex like that in

1440
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,159
San Diego and slowly but surely as

1441
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,599
people would move out I'd rent the next

1442
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,578
apartment and thought I was being all

1443
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,500
sneaky you know but they had the same

1444
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,780
kind of toilets I never thought to have

1445
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,599
the Ingenuity to flush the soil though

1446
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:08,579
oh it was the dumbest idea ever I just

1447
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,280
you know it was kind of it was kind of

1448
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:12,720
like you know the stupid [ __ ] that we

1449
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,599
did on dead tour that we could still be

1450
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,739
in jail for and we're not like you know

1451
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,780
like

1452
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:20,578
holy [ __ ] why did I do such stupid [ __ ]

1453
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,160
like I'd never do that again you know

1454
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:25,460
and I would never recommend anyone

1455
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:28,679
Flushing anything

1456
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:31,440

1457
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:33,659
just a bat I just got lucky

1458
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,240

1459
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:39,118

01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,759
the building and everyone was super

1473
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:14,460
private yeah you know like nobody ever

1474
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,680
like nobody ever said anything to me

1475
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:18,000
even though once you got up to the

1476
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,858
Second Story you could totally smell

1477
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,818
that just reads it probably right down

1478
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:23,039
the street

1479
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:26,639
yeah so

1480
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:29,159
I'm like holy [ __ ] I'm like who is it

1481
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:31,199
and so knock on the yeah I like walk up

1482
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:33,239
the door and I'm like hello

1483
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:36,358
and it's like the neighbor's girlfriend

1484
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:37,858
you know the girl that lives next door

1485
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:40,338
and she's like

1486
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:42,900
could I have a joint please

1487
01:00:40,338 --> 01:00:45,779
I'm like what

1488
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:49,700
I open the door and I literally grab her

1489
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,700
and pull her in to my place

1490
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:55,079
the way it was is once you're in my

1491
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,318
place you're basically in the grill yeah

1492
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:00,960
yeah right yeah and she was like oh my

1493
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:04,259
God she's like we knew you were growing

1494
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,900
but we had no idea it was like this

1495
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:10,200
right and like they were really cool

1496
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:12,240
like you know if I wasn't growing and

1497
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:13,858
paranoid I would have been friends with

1498
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,139
them like the whole time we would have

1499
01:01:13,858 --> 01:01:18,179
had great neighbors so it's so cool and

1500
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:20,519
I was literally only meeting them days

1501
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:24,480
before believing like we were harvesting

1502
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:26,039
getting the [ __ ] out yeah and so yeah

1503
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,380
she's like yeah obviously we've been

1504
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:30,960
smelling it for nine months and you know

1505
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:33,420
I I just couldn't take it anymore I I

1506
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,240
had to ask and I'm like all right that's

1507
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:38,280
cool and she's like hey so do you want

1508
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:41,399
to see mine

1509
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:44,460
I'm like what she's like yeah she's like

1510
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,440
it's nothing like this yeah but you know

1511
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,420
I got some plants over at my place too

1512
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,940
I'm like oh my God I can't believe it so

1513
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:53,338
I'm like all right I'll go and see it

1514
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:56,880
so I go over there they have no lights

1515
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:58,078
they just have plants in the window to

1516
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,019
the street

1517
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:03,240
and like when you're at the bottom of

1518
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:06,719
the street there's like two windows on

1519
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:08,578
every story yeah and like they had pot

1520
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:12,779
plants growing in their window I had no

1521
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:16,619
idea and like when you go up the stairs

1522
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:18,960
it like zigzags across right so like if

1523
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:22,318
the cops saw the plants in their window

1524
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,639
oh yeah come up the stairs like they

1525
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,858
would immediately know it's coming from

1526
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,598
my door yeah you know what I'm saying so

1527
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:29,338
I was like you gotta get rid of this

1528
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,960
[ __ ] right first of all

1529
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:33,659

1530
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,818
not gonna happen you know they weren't

1531

1533
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:42,119
I

1534
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:43,559
I forget what time of year it was but

1535
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:46,740
I think we're approaching winter

1536
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:48,540
actually and you know they had these

1537
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:51,179
pathetic plants that were starting to

1538
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:53,880
bloom but like I was like look I will

1539
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:55,500

1541
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,179

1542
01:02:57,298 --> 01:03:03,119

1548
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,260
not just in your window it wasn't like a

1549
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:18,719
south facing good window it was winter

1550
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:22,380
time they had no lights but when they

1551
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:24,298

1552
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,740
didn't you know I didn't want to drive

1553
01:03:24,298 --> 01:03:28,980
across country with it my plan was to

1554
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:32,899

1555
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,900
them plants oh

1556
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,500
you know when I first started growing

1557
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:40,139
let me just finish this one I used I

1558
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:43,318
Grew From Bad Seed right like getting

1559
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:46,739
clones you know there wasn't Riot Seed

1560
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:48,838
Co at the time yeah so like you know

1561
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,879
just like everything else that we had at

1562
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:56,039
the time it came from bag seed

1563
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:57,780
and I named every one of my plants a

1564
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:00,960
girl's name

1565
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:04,200
and the one that made it out West the

1566
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,760
one that I saved was called Francine ah

1567
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:11,358
I've heard of that one

1568
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,359
oh really my friend Francis no yeah

1569
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:19,260
you had that pipe from uh uh

1570
01:04:16,338 --> 01:04:21,179
yeah that you never smoked anything but

1571
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,559
the Francine out of but it was in the

1572
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:24,539
collection

1573
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,940
yeah my whole collection burned in the

1574
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:31,099
fires and melted the five dollar houses

1575
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:31,099
so hot that the glass melted

1576
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:36,298
but yeah I found like I found a plate of

1577
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:39,179
glass that had like my used to be my

1578
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:41,039
pipes like after he had this case that

1579
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:42,539
had a bunch a bunch of different pipes

1580
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,480
in it from dead tour and one of them was

1581
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:47,880
this piece that like the Francine piece

1582
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,760
and he only smoked Francine out of it

1583
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:54,660
and so when he retired that cut because

1584
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,339
it rotted you basically retired smoking

1585
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:58,318
out of that pipe I think I don't think

1586
01:04:56,338 --> 01:05:01,619
we ever smoked that yeah it was a

1587
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:04,318
bubbler Francine bubbler the Francine

1588
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:06,358
bubbler passion and devotion I dig it I

1589
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:09,599
dig that

1590
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:11,338
yeah the friends I definitely had it

1591
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,260
so

1592
01:05:11,338 --> 01:05:14,519
you got a question after I just wanted

1593
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,359
to finish saying about Francine you had

1594
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:20,039
a question Francis

1595
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:21,358
I was actually just gonna say dude that

1596
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,079
uh

1597
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:25,318
um

1598
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:27,599
I similarly when I was the last place I

1599
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:29,699
was in when I was growing in Chicago I

1600
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,859
was always super militant about like

1601
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:35,098
walking my dogs and I would try to see

1602
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:37,259
if it smelled anywhere and it never did

1603
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:40,380
and I thought it was so clever

1604
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:42,059
and then this guy knocked on my door and

1605
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,920
he was my neighbor and he was like would

1606
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:45,599
you mind coming into my room and coming

1607
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,579
up in my apartment and talking to me and

1608
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,539
I was like sure you know he's like I

1609
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:50,400
just don't want to talk to you in the

1610
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:53,219
courtyard and so I walked into his house

1611
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,900
and it smelled like someone was actively

1612
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:57,298
harvesting in there

1613
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:59,280
and like all the smell that I thought I

1614
01:05:57,298 --> 01:06:01,619
was so slick on he's like dude he's like

1615
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,220
for about two weeks every couple months

1616
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:06,720
my entire apartment smells like and met

1617
01:06:05,219 --> 01:06:10,439
my girlfriend and I weren't convinced

1618
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:13,679
it's you yeah I was like I thought I was

1619
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:15,599
so slick you know and I was and because

1620
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,879
it didn't smell outside my door it

1621
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,280
didn't fell outside the windows I cocked

1622
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,818
everything I was like so careful and

1623
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:25,440
it's straight really right next door

1624
01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:28,199
reeked dude reeked in his house like

1625
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,000
worse than my house like I couldn't you

1626
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:31,980
were just pumping it all right next door

1627
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,480
yeah I had no idea but apparently it

1628
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,338
smelled like someone was harvesting

1629
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,440
fresh weed in his house I walked in and

1630
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:40,519
I was like oh my God he's like no it's

1631
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:43,380
not a problem it's not a problem at all

1632
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:45,960
you know and I was like so panicked

1633
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,760
because yeah it's like you I don't think

1634
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,880
people understand today the Panic of

1635
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:53,220
having a small scene but not even most

1636
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:56,099
of your friends knowing and like you not

1637
01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:58,699
like it just was so sketch it just felt

1638
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,700
so sketched

1639
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:06,838
was that the trip that you basically got

1640
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:08,759
to California and your car caught on

1641
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:10,798
fire and you had to move back and no

1642
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,020
again no that was the time that I

1643
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:14,699
actually made it that was the time you

1644
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:16,679
made it because the first time you tried

1645
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:19,618
right like your VW bus with the pinions

1646
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:21,118
or whatever like it caught on fire you

1647
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:23,280
caught you caught all your [ __ ] on fire

1648
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,920
like basically right as you were getting

1649
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,480
to California and failed I actually had

1650
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,200
I actually had forgot about that for a

1651
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,318
while

1652
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:33,000
thanks for reminding me

1653
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:35,279
no he had the story of like how he was

1654
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,039
driving out like hippie style in this VW

1655
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,380
bus and you had to stop every so often

1656
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:42,480
and like adjust

1657
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,119
um well that happened so I had to adjust

1658
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,480
the points but that was when I was

1659
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:51,298
driving east so me and my girlfriend at

1660
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,579
the time we bought this uh Volkswagen

1661
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:54,960
bus on the West Coast

1662
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:56,880
and

1663
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,220
we drove it out east and when we drove

1664
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,619
it out east we had to stop like all the

1665
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:03,480
time to adjust the points but her dad

1666
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:05,760
was a mechanic

1667
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,199
and like he didn't want us to go

1668
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,059
but he's like all right if you're gonna

1669
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,219
go I'm gonna like fix this thing up a

1670
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,839
little bit so you're not like stranded

1671
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:15,659
in the middle of nowhere

1672
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:18,359
and so he fixed it up and the whole way

1673
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:20,399
across country we never had to adjust

1674
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:24,179
the points

1675
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:26,338
and we were 137 miles from the

1676
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:29,940
California border

1677
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:31,140
and it stalled and I was like oh I was I

1678
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,818
actually wasn't even that stressed about

1679
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,619
it because I was like

1680
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:37,199
yeah you know the last time when we're

1681
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:39,059
driving east we had to stop every 200

1682
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,460
miles and adjust the points yeah you

1683
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:43,920
know we just we just drove almost 3 000

1684
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:45,960
miles I was 137 miles from the

1685
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,060
California border

1686
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,338
and so I tried to turn the ignition and

1687
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:52,920
it makes like one little sound

1688
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:54,179
like trying to turn over and then just

1689
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,539
stops

1690
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:58,500
and I'm like huh and then look out the

1691
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:01,259
mirrors

1692
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:03,719
and it was breathing fire oh I know

1693
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:06,960
about the uh out the vents there was

1694
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:08,759
fire coming out of there and so like

1695
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,560
me and my girlfriend and I think we had

1696
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:12,420
a cat at the time that like we had it

1697
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,679
like the cat was like we had a bed in

1698
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:15,600
there and the cat was underneath and we

1699
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,279
had to like try to get the cat out of

1700
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,859
the cat when the cat got out the cat was

1701
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,480
like under the burning van I'm scared

1702
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:23,640
people want to [ __ ] come out or like

1703
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:27,838
trying to like you know

1704
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:29,660
Jesus so that time we had to like go

1705
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:32,939
with our heads between our head you know

1706
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:36,059
tails and like call our parents to fly

1707
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:37,919
us back home yeah we didn't make it but

1708
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:39,839
regarding that story something that you

1709
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,719
don't know Francis I don't know how

1710
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:46,559
interesting this is to the viewers

1711
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:49,198
last like two months ago

1712
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,239
my insurance provider calls me up and

1713
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,500
they say hey your license has been

1714
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:55,259
revoked

1715
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:57,600
I'm like what are you talking about I

1716
01:09:55,260 --> 01:10:01,320
was like I haven't even had a ticket in

1717
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,480
five years a year or more uh like they

1718
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:04,619
were like yeah something happened in

1719
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:07,859
Arizona

1720
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:10,500
in 1990

1721
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:12,599
and your license has been revoked

1722
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,100
and so what happened was when my man

1723
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,280
caught fire

1724
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:19,199
it like literally took an hour for a

1725
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,039
police department a police car to show

1726
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:22,919
up

1727
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:24,840
and then like another hour for the fire

1728
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,279
department to show up by the time they

1729
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,800
showed up it wasn't even on fire it was

1730
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:30,960
just hot yeah right

1731
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,840
and so like after losing everything we

1732
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:37,020
had and our dreams of making it out you

1733
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:40,260
know out west yeah so I yeah I hear you

1734
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:42,420
guys fine so I

1735
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:46,699
after losing everything we owned in our

1736
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:46,699
dreams of going out west to see Jerry

1737
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,159
he writes me a ticket for driving with

1738
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,678
no insurance

1739
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,658
and is it actually caught up like I

1740
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:57,359
never paid a ticket you know [ __ ]

1741
01:10:54,658 --> 01:11:00,420
yeah 18 you know 19 year old deadhead

1742
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:02,339
[ __ ] making bad decisions driving

1743
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,980
across country with no insurance that's

1744
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:07,560
a bad decision any of our young viewers

1745
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:09,059
out there should not do that you know

1746
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,219
like the flushing it down the toilet

1747
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:14,520
driving cross country these are not

1748
01:11:11,219 --> 01:11:17,340
recommended you know they you know don't

1749
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:20,340
do what I did how does one fix a ticket

1750
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,719
like this that is that old and just so

1751
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,619
so what happened was this is already

1752
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:26,539
like

1753
01:11:22,619 --> 01:11:26,539
10 years ago or more

1754
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,719
I couldn't renew my license when I tried

1755
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:34,980
to renew it they told me about the

1756
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:37,319
ticket and I paid it I actually now I

1757
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:38,759
paid it 10 years late you know like it

1758
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:44,340
took it took a while for them to track

1759
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:45,320
me down right but so I paid this [ __ ]

1760
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,219
ticket

1761
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:50,279
and so

1762
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:53,520
now I realize I've been driving around

1763
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:57,238
for six months with no insurance

1764
01:11:53,520 --> 01:12:00,120
and I had no idea yeah a DMV they didn't

1765
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:02,099
contact me that they expect you know

1766
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:04,260
revoked my license so if I would have

1767
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,239

01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:08,100
you know I'm gonna lose everything have

1769
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,519

1793
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:08,819
that yeah right you know until about

1794
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:10,920
eight bucks over eight dollars but you

1795
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:12,299
know I would have paid you know and I

1796
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,800
went to DMV they're like yeah it's not

1797
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,840
our responsibility to tell you that your

1798
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,579
license has been revoked you know and I

1799
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,079
was like so what are you telling me that

1800
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:22,039
I need to check the DMV website every

1801
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:22,039
morning when I wake up

1802
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,900
so that's that's the finale of of that

1803
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:29,579
Volkswagen story and that failed good

1804
01:13:27,899 --> 01:13:31,319
story though

1805
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:32,819
see my memory is [ __ ] up but there's

1806
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:36,179
certain things that I remember clearly

1807
01:13:32,819 --> 01:13:39,299
yeah I mean I may not have the entire

1808
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:42,840
chem dog history down as much as Francis

1809
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:46,679
does but you know I haven't lost it all

1810
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:48,360
yet I still got something I mean I've

1811
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:51,119
said I've said this before on the

1812
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:54,059
podcast or whatever but like basically

1813
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:57,840
all the stories that I have before I

1814
01:13:54,060 --> 01:14:00,000
came into it come from him yeah you know

1815
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,159
and him and I just sitting around like

1816
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,219
you people do like like friends and

1817
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:07,500
Stoners shooting the [ __ ] about things

1818
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:09,899
and the reason why I believe them over

1819
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:12,300
most of the other stories was just

1820
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:15,059
because he told them to me so long

1821
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:17,219
before it got famous yeah

1822
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:20,280
like you know like when we were growing

1823
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:22,140
the chem dog like nobody like I mean

1824
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:24,539
people the only people that like there

1825
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:27,179
was like a few there was like maybe four

1826
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:31,800
friends that had it

1827
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:34,800
it was you know like me him skunk VA and

1828
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:37,500
I see like that was pretty much it and

1829
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,659
like you know I mean it wasn't

1830
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:42,719
like it wasn't famous it wasn't well

1831
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:44,639
known it wasn't like any of that kind of

1832
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,719
stuff there wasn't any Legend to having

1833
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,300
it

1834
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:50,340
so there wasn't any reason to embellish

1835
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,779
him

1836
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,840
back back

1837
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:57,539
when I started selling the chem dog

1838
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:00,239
people would buy it

1839
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:02,279
was it was just like you took one smell

1840
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:04,500
of it and you know that you have never

1841
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:07,679
had anything like that before

1842
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:10,020
and you know new people would just be

1843
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,880
instantly ready to

1844
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,560
I mean if I remember for whatever price

1845
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,300
if I remember what you were telling me

1846
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,539
right probably the best place to get

1847
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,340
chem dog was outside of a Jerry band

1848
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:22,800
show at The Warfield

1849
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:24,659
or somewhere like that

1850
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,699
I mean

1851
01:15:24,658 --> 01:15:30,299
I really

1852
01:15:26,698 --> 01:15:32,099
I didn't have to go far to sell it you

1853
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,719
know the only people that were getting

1854
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:36,060
the chem dog

1855
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:39,000
were friends of mine and friends of mine

1856
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:40,500
would beg me to sell it all to them

1857
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,238
just so that they could sell it to their

1858
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,579
friend like you couldn't no one else

1859
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:45,839
could make money on it you know I I was

1860
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:48,179
selling this [ __ ] for 400 actually

1861
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,340
that's not true I think skunk VA he

1862
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:52,980
might have made some money on it

1863
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:54,719
um but uh you know I was telling the

1864
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:56,459
ship 400 bucks an ounce

1865
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,319
and like people like fine I'll buy a

1866
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,859
pound because you know at the time I

1867
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:04,979
would only Harvest three or four pounds

1868
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:06,000
and you know it's three months to the

1869
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:08,939
next crop

1870
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,380
so I'd be fine just selling the weed

1871
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:12,238
over that three to four months for the

1872
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:15,000
as much money as I could

1873
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:17,879
and so you know back then I was getting

1874
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,380
you know 400 bucks an ounce 6 400 pounds

1875
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,819
but you know it started off with friends

1876
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,440
just buying an ounce and then they would

1877
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:24,000
be like yeah you know I'll just buy the

1878
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:27,238
whole thing

1879
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:30,840
and um so I told the story about

1880
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:34,439
how me and not so dog so I shared the

1881
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:36,779
story about how not so dog and I met and

1882
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:40,500
I wanted to share the stories what I can

1883
01:16:36,779 --> 01:16:44,340
remember of it of how uh skunk VA and I

1884
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:46,619
met and how klopp and I met yeah

1885
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:49,380
so

1886
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:53,219
start with skunk VA

1887
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:54,779
I moved to California you know after

1888
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:56,880
that apartment

1889
01:16:54,779 --> 01:16:58,920
you know with my neighbor friends asked

1890
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,020
me for some wages before I left yeah we

1891
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,940
successfully made it out to Cali

1892
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,219
and

1893
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:07,500
rented this house it was like a little

1894
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:10,260
cottage in the backyard where we turned

1895
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:14,819
one of the rooms into a grow

1896
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:18,860
and I think we had six 600 watt lights

1897
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:18,859
total of 3 600 watts

1898
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:26,039
you know coming from a place where you

1899
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:28,500
know when I left Staten Island

1900
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:31,140
you know that was I think it was less

1901
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:33,899
than that you know and you know people

1902
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:35,640
are growing with fluorescent lights and

1903
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:38,158
so

1904
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,900
and you know if you get

1905
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:41,639
three pounds

1906
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:43,559
and you're getting sixty four hundred a

1907
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:46,500
pound

1908
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:49,560
that's pretty good yeah it's decent you

1909
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:52,738
know like you know like you could

1910
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:55,800
you're a baller yeah you know yeah so

1911
01:17:52,738 --> 01:18:00,178
back then it was way easier

1912
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:03,060
so but because I was so paranoid

1913
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:04,859
I never wanted to sell weed to people

1914
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:07,500
around

1915
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:11,460
like around like where I live

1916
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:13,439
and so I was relying heavily on Grateful

1917
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,819
Dead Jerry Garcia

1918
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,079
but

1919
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:21,779
when I had a crop come down

1920
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:24,359
and they weren't playing which you know

1921
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:25,559
was rare but you know every now and

1922
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:28,439
again there was a month or so where

1923
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:31,560
there was nothing happened yeah and you

1924
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:33,359
know so I went to Golden Gate Park to

1925
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,000
the Panhandle

1926
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:40,639
and

1927
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,640
I this was before I had the chem dog

1928
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:44,520
um

1929
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:46,439
but I met Jason down in the Panhandle I

1930
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,300
like was like Hey you know I got some

1931
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:51,299
time but I want to sell

1932
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:52,679
and you know he was living out there

1933
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:55,079
and

1934
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:58,020
you know that's how we became friends is

1935
01:18:55,079 --> 01:19:00,979
I offered him some of my homegrown

1936
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:05,400
in the panhandle of Golden Gate Park

1937
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:07,259
like the shadiest drug dealing part of

1938
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:10,259
Golden Gate Park

1939
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,260
like

1940
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:16,380
he started doing good

1941
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:19,319
I was growing like random seeds uh

1942
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,579
you know see grown stuff she had some

1943
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:23,759
Francine

1944
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:28,100
but uh you know it

1945
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,100
there was some good stuff but it was

1946
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,020
you know probably it was actually today

1947
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:36,119
I would appreciate it more you know I

1948
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:39,179
had some stuff that had a lot of sativa

1949
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:41,579
in it sure and you know but it was hard

1950
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:44,399
to grow particularly when you're not the

1951
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:47,579
best grower and these things are getting

1952
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:51,119
big but then when you would smoke it

1953
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:53,760
you would get that sativa Terps and be

1954
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:57,000
like holy [ __ ] you know like it was

1955
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,679
impressive you know I'm sure skunk VA

1956
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,539
would remember the strain names I I

1957
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:03,719
don't really remember anymore what it

1958
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:06,539
was it was nothing it wasn't chem dog or

1959
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:08,819
sour or super skunk anything on that

1960
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:09,779
nothing that carried on not too much it

1961
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:12,599
might have been

1962
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:14,939
I might have taken home some RFK yeah

1963
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,260
you know from Club I definitely want to

1964
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:19,259
talk more with you about that after we

1965
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:21,960
go overclock okay

1966
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:24,060
um but yeah and

1967
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,039
so

1968
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:28,320
I believe at the time like

1969
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:29,640
he's just a traveling hippie

1970
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:32,340
and

1971
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:35,280
he eventually gets a we did many

1972
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:37,380
transactions he helped me sell a lot of

1973
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:38,880
my weed and then eventually he moved up

1974
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:42,659
to Sonoma County

1975
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,760
and you know I taught him how to grow

1976
01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:45,658
so

1977
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,000
um

1978
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:49,979
I think you were telling me that that he

1979
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,658
credits someone else's being his mentor

1980
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:54,119
is that what you said I believe it was

1981
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:56,299
the the person that he got the uh

1982
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:56,300
Virginia

1983
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:02,340
yeah

1984
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:04,079
I think that was more of a like uh

1985
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,100
because I think I remember him telling

1986
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,198
me about this guy I think it was more

1987
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:09,659
like a mentor on a personal level

1988
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:11,939
you know could be I I was the one that

1989
01:21:09,658 --> 01:21:13,019
first introduced him to Growing really I

1990
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:15,839
think

1991
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:17,340
I could be wrong I'm sure if Jason tells

1992
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,159
different he's correct because his

1993
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:22,619
memory is like so ridiculous

1994
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:28,819
um but yeah you know I met Jason like

1995
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:28,819
that or skunk VA and he uh

1996
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:35,400
you know we became super tight and

1997
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:36,899
partners in a grow he grew the chem dog

1998
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:39,299
and then

1999
01:21:36,899 --> 01:21:42,359
he uh he eventually became partners with

2000
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:45,600
Ben in a grow and so that's how

2001
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:47,579
Ben or uh IC Collective

2002
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,380
that's how they got it

2003
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:52,140
so

2004
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:55,319
but yeah like I've been friends with

2005
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:57,060
those guys now since

2006
01:21:55,319 --> 01:21:59,219
the Grateful Dead

2007
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:01,500
you know and so that's one thing that I

2008
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:04,739
wanted to say like you got a little bit

2009
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:08,399
of the timeline wrong I actually got so

2010
01:22:04,738 --> 01:22:10,198
Jason excuse me skunk VA I don't even

2011
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:13,799
know how he wants to be addressed

2012
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:16,759
that's fine yeah but uh

2013
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,760
he uh

2014
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:22,139
we used to go see Jerry together at The

2015
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:23,340
Warfield it was you know the best thing

2016
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,140
ever

2017
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:27,179
and

2018
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,780
he had a friend that came from New York

2019
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:33,239
but not New York from Virginia

2020
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:35,179
and he saw the chem dog

2021
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:39,479
and he really wanted

2022
01:22:35,179 --> 01:22:42,539
and Jason was real and he had some

2023
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:46,079
huh wasn't it the Francine he wanted Kim

2024
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:47,579
dog oh oh no nothing

2025
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:48,840
you're right because I didn't even have

2026
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:50,880
that because you didn't have the chem

2027
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,860
dog yet he wanted the Francine I didn't

2028
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,420
even have the chem Doug

2029
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:56,880
right because

2030
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:58,380
right I'm trying I'm trying to remember

2031
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,760
like

2032
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,079
surprised that he wanted the Francine

2033
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,520
that bad that he was able that I was

2034
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:03,359
able to get skunk for it I don't exactly

2035
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,300
remember

2036
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,979
I do remember some trade was made

2037
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,579
I met him

2038
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:14,459
and picked up the

2039
01:23:10,579 --> 01:23:16,920
uh skunk cut the VA skunk

2040
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,480
which is not the Super Skunk but it's

2041
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,940
definitely some skunky weed probably a

2042
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:26,399
cross of it yeah and

2043
01:23:20,939 --> 01:23:29,279
Greg wanted this cut or chem dog so

2044
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:31,559
Greg would never give up the chem dog

2045
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:33,359
till I had this

2046
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,760
and he wanted this

2047
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:37,679
so he was willing to trade it to me he

2048
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,420
asked that I not like really spread it

2049
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,460
around so the only people that I ever

2050
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:45,658
really gave it to were people that I was

2051
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:47,039
working with sure you know

2052
01:23:45,658 --> 01:23:48,539
um

2053
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:50,100
but

2054
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:52,859
that's the

2055
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:56,100
much shorter story of how I got the chem

2056
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:58,979
dog from Greg we traded for that skunk

2057
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:00,000
and the part of the story that I like to

2058
01:23:58,979 --> 01:24:03,419
tell is

2059
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,238
I drove across country and I had it in a

2060
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:08,940
like Burger King Cup

2061
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:10,919
you know it was like in a you know two

2062
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:13,979
inch Oasis Cube or something like that

2063
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,500
and it was a growing it was a growing

2064
01:24:13,979 --> 01:24:18,119
cutting and like if there was a trucker

2065
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,859
coming by I just like put the cap on it

2066
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:21,658
or if I was like running into a gas

2067
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:24,479
station or something I just put the cap

2068
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:26,460
on it but I drove the chem dog across

2069
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:29,158
country

2070
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:31,260
um in like two Burger King you know I

2071
01:24:29,158 --> 01:24:33,539
had one probably that had like a couple

2072
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:35,159
of chem dog cuts and another one that

2073
01:24:33,539 --> 01:24:36,658
had the skunk cuts

2074
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:39,179
wow

2075
01:24:36,658 --> 01:24:41,698
and you said in the video that I didn't

2076
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:43,560
want the other cut that he had

2077
01:24:41,698 --> 01:24:45,238

2081
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:54,479
of these skunks it was already like

2082
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,939
an ambitious thing to do and of course

2083

01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:33,179
and he's like hey

2120
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:36,679
you guys doing down there smoking weed

2121
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:36,679
weed because of course we were yeah

2122
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:43,139
that's how I met clop it was one day

2123
01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:45,179
like me and my girlfriend was sitting on

2124
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:47,940
the streets smoking weed

2125
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:50,760
and he called us up into his place

2126
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:54,839
and at this point he had never grown

2127
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:57,000
weed but like we showed him kind bud

2128
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:00,179
and it was indoor

2129
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:03,479
and you know he was like you can grow

2130
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:06,600
weed like this in your house

2131
01:27:03,479 --> 01:27:11,158
and we're like yeah that's what this is

2132
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:12,659
and so like I'm not gonna say I'm uh his

2133
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:14,819
mentor or anything because he did

2134
01:27:12,658 --> 01:27:16,559
everything by himself but like I

2135
01:27:14,819 --> 01:27:18,960
inspired him at that moment he like

2136
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,480
immediately went I'll never forget he

2137
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,340
had a 10 gallon fish tank

2138
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:25,678
and he put some dirt on the bottom of it

2139
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:28,920
and then he planted some seeds

2140
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:31,020
and they sprouted and his cat [ __ ]

2141
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:33,260
dug him up

2142
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:36,840
I've heard that so many times

2143
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:40,079
his cat dug him up

2144
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:44,579
but he eventually like he did it again

2145
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:47,039
and he put some plants in a closet it

2146
01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:49,679
was like maybe a two foot deep by six

2147
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:53,158
foot long closet

2148
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:55,739
um with like shop lights

2149
01:27:53,158 --> 01:27:58,619
and that was the first cannabis that I

2150
01:27:55,738 --> 01:28:02,039
ever saw grown so I had gotten you know

2151
01:27:58,619 --> 01:28:05,519
beautiful kind bud in California and you

2152
01:28:02,039 --> 01:28:08,639
know Dead shows but I had never

2153
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:11,300
seen it grown yeah and even even though

2154
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:14,219
it was under fluorescent lights

2155
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:15,960
he was able to harvest weed in a couple

2156
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:17,340
of months

2157
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,380
and

2158
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:21,539
that was kind of the inspiration for

2159
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:23,279
everything you know at that point I was

2160
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:25,619
like I gotta do this

2161
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:28,079
you know and that's

2162
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:30,179
so and

2163
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:32,939
you know obviously

2164
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:34,380
after you know doing all right he

2165
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:36,238
eventually moved out of that place got

2166
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:37,619
another place and started growing with

2167
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:39,779
some real lights

2168
01:28:37,619 --> 01:28:42,539
he didn't always grow with uh oh

2169
01:28:39,779 --> 01:28:44,158
obviously yeah but

2170
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:45,840
um

2171
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:47,759
and I mean

2172
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,159
we talked about the RFK a little bit

2173
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:52,020
privately yeah

2174
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,638
we went to some Grateful Dead shows and

2175
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:56,460
the story is similar to the chem dog

2176
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:59,880
story but didn't turn out quite as

2177
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:02,340
famous of course sure but um

2178
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:04,319
yeah so he bought some flour

2179
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:07,319
at the Dead show

2180
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:09,119
found a couple of seeds planted them

2181
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:09,960
and he got the RFK number one two and

2182
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:11,279
three

2183
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,859
wow

2184
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:16,198
and there's three different ones

2185
01:29:13,859 --> 01:29:18,599
yeah there was oh interesting

2186
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:21,059
interesting how different were they yeah

2187
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:24,000
remember they were very different

2188
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:25,860
oh yeah different enough that he would

2189
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,600
keep them all

2190
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:30,000
interesting very interesting I wonder

2191
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,460
which one is still around

2192
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:36,079
yeah you have to talk to him about it

2193
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:36,079
yeah I can't wait you know

2194
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:40,379
I'm a little embarrassed because you

2195
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,719
know my memory isn't as good as Francis

2196
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:46,500
is or

2197
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:48,899
um skunk VA or klopp you know you're

2198
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:51,899
doing fine they all have their piece of

2199
01:29:48,899 --> 01:29:53,638
the story and you know

2200
01:29:51,899 --> 01:29:55,920
everything that I've heard has been

2201
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:58,079
accurate yeah you know I haven't I

2202
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,960
haven't heard you know just some like

2203
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:03,658
little details that really

2204
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:06,239
it's more about personal stuff I mean

2205
01:30:03,658 --> 01:30:08,879
okay there's one thing that I have no

2206
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:10,879
evidence to but I'd like to bring this

2207
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,980
up for discussion

2208
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,060
I don't really believe and I hate to

2209
01:30:13,979 --> 01:30:18,299
just

2210
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:20,520
call people out but I'm gonna yeah

2211
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,739
I don't believe that Greg

2212
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:26,219
had these

2213
01:30:22,738 --> 01:30:28,619
seeds from the same batch

2214
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:30,539
five or so years later

2215
01:30:28,619 --> 01:30:33,539
and then that's when he was germinating

2216
01:30:30,539 --> 01:30:34,738
them yeah like those later seeds was

2217
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:37,439
something else

2218
01:30:34,738 --> 01:30:39,238
and I mean like he's even said it before

2219
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:42,119
that like the chem dog is whatever he's

2220
01:30:39,238 --> 01:30:43,799
growing at that moment yeah and

2221
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:46,859
you know

2222
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:49,980
I don't think just because

2223
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:52,920
think about it from his perspective

2224
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:54,899
if you just popped a couple of seeds and

2225
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:56,340
pulled the most most amazing chem dog

2226
01:30:54,899 --> 01:30:58,439
ever

2227
01:30:56,340 --> 01:31:00,659
are you gonna wait five years to plant

2228
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:03,119
more of them and then five years more to

2229
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:05,599
plant the rest it's just like you know

2230
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:09,059
yeah the logic's never worked out what

2231
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,560
yeah with poor like knowledge on how to

2232
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:12,179
save the seeds

2233
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,600
like the seeds probably would have been

2234
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:17,779
no good five years later yeah definitely

2235
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:21,780
nobody was thinking in fridges

2236
01:31:17,779 --> 01:31:24,238
right so I kind of

2237
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:25,738
that part of the story even you know

2238
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:27,839
you know question that

2239
01:31:25,738 --> 01:31:29,698
but that wasn't even any part of the

2240
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:33,300
story that I had anything to do with

2241
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:35,638
it's fair you know so uh wait what how

2242
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:37,800
did you interact with the chemd when did

2243
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:40,079
that come around

2244
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:44,539
I never had the candy oh you never had

2245
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:46,859
it well so now here's he did not because

2246
01:31:44,539 --> 01:31:47,579
let's just say

2247
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:49,738
um

2248
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:51,539
and I I could tell this part of the

2249
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:52,500
story I suppose

2250
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:54,000
um

2251
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:57,479
so

2252
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,479
uh I used to be a bit at times I used to

2253
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:04,500
be a bit of a bridge between skunk VA

2254
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:06,359
and Gabby here and there right

2255
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:08,158
um you know they they had some battles

2256
01:32:06,359 --> 01:32:10,979
and stuff like that back and forth but

2257
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:16,259
he would still come to Gabby's shop

2258
01:32:10,979 --> 01:32:19,439
uh to buy stuff yeah right and there was

2259
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:21,239
this thing where he had gotten online I

2260
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:22,799
think it was an 06 or something like

2261
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:24,599
that he had gotten online and he had

2262
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,820
started talking about the chem on the

2263
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:29,280
forums for the first time which is where

2264
01:32:26,819 --> 01:32:34,139
the whole skunk VA moniker and all that

2265
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:36,719
started right yeah and you know at that

2266
01:32:34,139 --> 01:32:39,659
point chem dog himself had not had the

2267
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:44,039
actual chem dog for some years yeah

2268
01:32:39,658 --> 01:32:48,960
right so he wanted it back and so when

2269
01:32:44,039 --> 01:32:51,119
Kim dog told us if you bring me the chem

2270
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:55,920
dog I'll give you this new chem that I

2271
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:58,979
had yeah so skunk VA ended up flying out

2272
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:01,500
to back east or something with the the

2273
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:04,559
uh the chem dog what we call the chem 91

2274
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:07,198
you know giving it to giving it to dude

2275
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:10,440
and dude gave D and he brought it back

2276
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:12,779
and he gave it to ice Eagle yeah right

2277
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:15,238
and and I see Collective then gave it

2278
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:20,340
some food after they'd bombed it up

2279
01:33:15,238 --> 01:33:22,859
right but at that point in 06

2280
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,900
um you know uh Gabby was doing so well

2281
01:33:22,859 --> 01:33:27,179
with the shop and stuff like that he'd

2282
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:30,238
kind of taken a that was the beginning

2283
01:33:27,179 --> 01:33:32,760
of your kind of hiatus

2284
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:35,039
um you know from collecting cuts and

2285
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:39,360
having that whole thing going on the the

2286
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:41,960
shop was really booming then you know he

2287
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:44,819
was you know so the chemd came around

2288
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:47,060
you know kind of after

2289
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:49,079
um after he had I guess you could say

2290
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:51,539
retired for a bit

2291
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:54,600
gotcha I I actually

2292
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:56,100
I never liked the chemd nearly as much

2293
01:33:54,600 --> 01:34:00,120
as everyone else

2294
01:33:56,100 --> 01:34:03,179
no you know like I just you know and

2295
01:34:00,119 --> 01:34:06,420
that's part of you know why I'm saying

2296
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:07,800
this year for me is the original chem

2297
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:09,600
dog

2298
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,400
and then there's everything else

2299
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,739
you know dude you might you might have

2300
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:16,519
uh you might have you probably lost this

2301
01:34:13,738 --> 01:34:16,519
stuff in the fire

2302
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:22,259
uh in the early in the very early 2000s

2303
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:24,238
you had that you had this really nice

2304
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:27,420
camera and we remember we did that

2305
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:29,658
little like mini Greenhouse rip of the

2306
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,658
camera

2307
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:40,579
yeah my avatar on IG is I still have

2308
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:40,579
like eight by eleven and a half photos

2309
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:46,260
you I will that you print it out for me

2310
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:47,840
and my avatar is actually a picture of

2311
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:50,940
that stuff that you and I grew together

2312
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,800
I don't even know 2002 or something on

2313
01:34:50,939 --> 01:34:55,079
it was forever are we talking about are

2314
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,699
we talking about the greenhouse like the

2315
01:34:55,079 --> 01:34:58,819
bigger Greenhouse oh the small ones no

2316
01:34:56,698 --> 01:35:01,799
the little one in your yard

2317
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:03,599
the little not the bigger one the little

2318
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,699
one in your yard

2319
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:08,400
yeah

2320
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:10,379
yeah I mean like you know he just cut

2321
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:12,238
out there for a second but what people

2322
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:14,100
should realize is that like with these

2323
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:17,279
stories and stuff

2324
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:19,500
you know we've acquired knowledge pretty

2325
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:22,019
well at this point and it's pretty easy

2326
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:24,179
to like get started and learn a lot but

2327
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:26,040
like in the early and mid 90s and

2328
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:28,319
throughout the 90s really knowledge was

2329
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:29,899
hard to come by and people had some

2330
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:32,519
pretty hokey setups in the beginning

2331
01:35:29,899 --> 01:35:33,839
yeah sounds like it you know just

2332
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,280
because you're trying to get started

2333
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:38,219
you're trying to figure out stuff that

2334
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:40,019
worked there's not much there's not you

2335
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:41,939
know there's not grow stores there's not

2336
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:44,280
people there that'll help you get set up

2337
01:35:41,939 --> 01:35:46,019
or learn or anything like that I mean

2338
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:47,399
it's not as easy to find grow books

2339
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:48,960
either like unless you went on High

2340
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:51,719
Times and risking your address I mean

2341
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:54,300
when I first moved to California the

2342
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:57,539
first little bit I was there you know it

2343
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:58,940
was like you know going to uh I had to

2344
01:35:57,539 --> 01:36:01,260
go to Berkeley

2345
01:35:58,939 --> 01:36:05,279
from Mendo which was a two and a half

2346
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:07,380
hour drive yeah and you know uh Gabby

2347
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:09,179
worked at the first store that opened up

2348
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:11,819
in Sonoma

2349
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:13,800
and so I only had to drive an hour and

2350
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:15,719
10 minutes

2351
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,480
um just so people know it's like the

2352
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:20,460
stories that I tell are like what I

2353
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:22,198
remember from him telling me this stuff

2354
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:24,119
but he was telling me all these stories

2355
01:36:22,198 --> 01:36:26,638
you know

2356
01:36:24,119 --> 01:36:31,079
um 20 plus you know over 20 years ago

2357
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:33,060
yeah long long time you know and I mean

2358
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:35,279
I don't think chem started to become

2359
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:37,560
famous or like well known as far as to

2360
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:41,219
like the Kana Community until probably

2361
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:43,380
like 0607-ish when skunk VA got online

2362
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:46,920
and started really telling the story to

2363
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:49,739
a wider audience so for I don't know

2364
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:52,380
years it was literally like at least on

2365
01:36:49,738 --> 01:36:55,678
the west coast group of us yeah it was

2366
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:57,119
Gabby and skunk VA and myself and I see

2367
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:59,520
Collective and we were pretty much like

2368
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:02,639
the only people that had it

2369
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:04,320
you know yeah and I mean and that's

2370
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:06,420
that's how they kept the cuts I mean he

2371
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:09,479
kind of talked about how you know he was

2372
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:12,300
he was told to keep it close and he he

2373
01:37:09,479 --> 01:37:14,399
didn't want to be considered stingy with

2374
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:16,560
it per se but he wanted to keep his word

2375
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:20,519
you know to to whoever he got it from

2376
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:22,260
and uh yeah I mean it it sounds like it

2377
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:24,420
was kept pretty pretty tight in those

2378
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:26,760
circles so it would have been hard for

2379
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:28,679
for that to proliferate uh the culture

2380
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,600
at the time super hard you know what I

2381
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:32,460
mean

2382
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,920
it didn't it didn't leak really out of

2383
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:37,020
our tiny little group and I mean really

2384
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,719
like when it comes down to it like like

2385
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:41,820
Dude said it was like it wasn't even

2386
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:43,560
like he gave it to like random people it

2387
01:37:41,819 --> 01:37:45,719
was literally like the people that were

2388
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:47,760
closest to him that he was actively like

2389
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:51,600
growing and partnering and doing things

2390
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:53,520
with yeah you know so it kind of when

2391
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,900
you just when you when you have like

2392
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,000
these growth Partnerships if people

2393
01:37:54,899 --> 01:37:58,859
don't know like you're sharing your

2394
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,600
library as you're there so they have

2395
01:37:58,859 --> 01:38:02,279
every opportunity to take Cuts if they

2396
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,500
want to so you kind of go into it with

2397
01:38:02,279 --> 01:38:06,000
the mindset that like what I'm sharing

2398
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,738
is what I'm sharing because we have this

2399
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,420
here I don't think I don't know if

2400
01:38:07,738 --> 01:38:11,939
people know this but I'll just say it

2401
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:14,819
anyway is that I think when most famous

2402
01:38:11,939 --> 01:38:16,379
people tell stories

2403
01:38:14,819 --> 01:38:19,019
um you know can a famous or whatever

2404
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:21,060
right certainly me not that I'm famous

2405
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:23,760
but like certainly me but I believe

2406
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:26,100
almost everyone it's like when they tell

2407
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,600
the story it's almost always a

2408
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:30,120
collaborative effort there's almost

2409
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,980
always some friends involved it's like a

2410
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:34,079
loose collection of homies doing stuff

2411
01:38:31,979 --> 01:38:35,759
together you know and some of that

2412
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:38,819
sometimes depending on the ego of the

2413
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:41,340
person either gets included or left out

2414
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:43,019
yeah you know very much like a lot a lot

2415
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:44,460
of times people think oh you know I was

2416
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:47,280
in my basement I was all by myself

2417
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:49,619
nobody even knew no it's like just

2418
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:51,179
that's not really how how weed growing

2419
01:38:49,619 --> 01:38:53,519
worked in my opinion it was like your

2420
01:38:51,179 --> 01:38:55,980
best friends yeah they kind of had

2421
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:59,159
everything you had yeah you were helping

2422
01:38:55,979 --> 01:39:02,579
each other keep things alive like I mean

2423
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:04,819
the the dog got lost in our crew by

2424
01:39:02,579 --> 01:39:08,519
individuals numerous times

2425
01:39:04,819 --> 01:39:11,579
just never all four of us at once yeah

2426
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:15,900
you know actually no

2427
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:17,579
you know and so it's like I try to be

2428
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:19,738
you know I don't want to I don't I don't

2429
01:39:17,579 --> 01:39:21,119
ever want to get accused of like you

2430
01:39:19,738 --> 01:39:22,678
know writing people out or something

2431
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:25,260
like that but sometimes I don't mention

2432
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:27,960
it just because like I'm worried about

2433
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:29,699
their privacy sure maybe they've gone on

2434
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:31,380
to do something else or maybe they have

2435
01:39:29,698 --> 01:39:33,178
a career or something like that that

2436
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:35,219
isn't the most conducive to like talking

2437
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:37,920
publicly about weed stories or something

2438
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:40,079
well in this case Gabby he

2439
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:42,658
and we talked about this off air you

2440
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:45,119
just prior he just didn't want to insert

2441
01:39:42,658 --> 01:39:48,000
himself into the story he felt like he

2442
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:50,639
didn't do enough to Warrant having like

2443
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:54,119
some big place and some story it wasn't

2444
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:56,579
a big ego Flex for him on it the crazy

2445
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:59,539
they want the attention as far as I'm

2446
01:39:56,579 --> 01:40:03,479
aware and this is just probably raw luck

2447
01:39:59,539 --> 01:40:04,920
I don't think anyone would have the cut

2448
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:07,079
if

2449
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:09,960
he hadn't brought it West yeah there's

2450
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:11,519
no way no because what it seems to be is

2451
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:14,279
that and I was talking about this even

2452
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,020
with some like pretty unknown you called

2453
01:40:14,279 --> 01:40:17,759
chem fam or whatever but yeah people

2454
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:19,860
that are very close to chem dog and have

2455
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:22,679
been in that little circle for a long

2456
01:40:19,859 --> 01:40:26,639
time it's like it got law the original

2457
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:29,039
cut got lost back East yeah and you know

2458
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:32,460
it it survived in this little teeny

2459
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:34,619
Circle that we had so in that regard the

2460
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:37,800
only you know he can say he's not

2461
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:39,539
important you know but like if he hadn't

2462
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:42,840
brought it out to us

2463
01:40:39,539 --> 01:40:44,119
then nobody would have it well it

2464
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:48,060
invited

2465
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:49,800
by even further extension had had he not

2466
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:51,300
shown clock that weed we wouldn't have

2467
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,100
sour

2468
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:55,619
yeah I mean yeah there's all kinds of

2469
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:58,199
yeah there's all there I mean there's so

2470
01:40:55,619 --> 01:41:00,840
it's like you can be you know I I I joke

2471
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:04,319
or or whatever about like you know like

2472
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:06,239
uh being in the forest being Forest Gump

2473
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:08,219
and like stumbling around like an idiot

2474
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:10,138
while like Fame like important things

2475
01:41:08,219 --> 01:41:11,579
happen around me or whatever but at some

2476
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:13,440
points in time

2477
01:41:11,579 --> 01:41:15,658
I think everyone has a little bit of

2478
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:18,658
that where like no one no no one knew

2479
01:41:15,658 --> 01:41:21,899
any of these stories how many 17 year

2480
01:41:18,658 --> 01:41:24,059
old kids have have you know how many

2481
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:26,399
young kids how many young hippies have

2482
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:29,780
cracked seeds like Gabby was talking

2483
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:33,059
about and nothing ever came of it yeah

2484
01:41:29,779 --> 01:41:35,179
and so a lot of it too is like you have

2485
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:38,159
differing memories from people

2486
01:41:35,179 --> 01:41:40,260
and nobody had any idea that like

2487
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:41,599
everyone was gonna like parse every

2488
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:44,659
single statement

2489
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,659
yeah yeah

2490
01:41:44,819 --> 01:41:50,340
hoping

2491
01:41:46,738 --> 01:41:54,238
little tidbits will bubble up

2492
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:54,960
so we were just talking Gabby about

2493
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,299
um

2494
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:59,460
about how you were talking offline about

2495
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:01,619
how you didn't want to interject

2496
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:05,698
yourself into the story

2497
01:42:01,618 --> 01:42:08,399
but I was kind of saying huh

2498
01:42:05,698 --> 01:42:10,618
I'm trying to remember when

2499
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:13,138
what part of it we're talking about just

2500
01:42:10,618 --> 01:42:14,939
just chem dog in general and I was I was

2501
01:42:13,139 --> 01:42:17,880
basically saying that like I if I don't

2502
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:19,618
think if you hadn't brought it West

2503
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:22,920
I don't think anybody would know what it

2504
01:42:19,618 --> 01:42:24,479
is because it in our little how much how

2505
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,679
much Grant how much credit do we give

2506
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:26,658
the postman

2507
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:29,158
for

2508
01:42:26,658 --> 01:42:31,559
delivering uh [ __ ] you know like in the

2509
01:42:29,158 --> 01:42:34,259
end it's just like

2510
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:36,060
you know and while you were gone I think

2511
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,900
I think I'm par I think I'm part of the

2512
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:39,780
story

2513
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:42,059
sure you know but like

2514
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:45,359
you know the what I wanted to be my

2515
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:46,440
legacy was The Not So dog

2516
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:48,118
yeah

2517
01:42:46,439 --> 01:42:50,638
really

2518
01:42:48,118 --> 01:42:53,819
well I mean I was working on it you know

2519
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:55,980
yeah I was working on Francis and I you

2520
01:42:53,819 --> 01:43:00,179
know we were working on doing some

2521
01:42:55,979 --> 01:43:01,859
breeding to make the next thing that was

2522
01:43:00,179 --> 01:43:04,440
going to be

2523
01:43:01,859 --> 01:43:07,380
you know better than the dog yeah and

2524
01:43:04,439 --> 01:43:11,939
honestly

2525
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:12,779
I think we failed terribly you know and

2526
01:43:11,939 --> 01:43:14,698
um

2527
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:19,079
that's breeding

2528
01:43:14,698 --> 01:43:21,899
yeah and you know it was first of all my

2529
01:43:19,079 --> 01:43:24,960
failed terribly we actually made some

2530
01:43:21,899 --> 01:43:27,299
really awesome seeds yeah they just

2531
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,158
weren't what we wanted you didn't hit

2532
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:31,260
the goal you were going for

2533
01:43:29,158 --> 01:43:34,559
we were trying to get

2534
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:36,360
get you know chem and chem crosses

2535
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,520
and to me

2536
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:41,579
nothing that we did

2537
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:45,300
was actually dog-like

2538
01:43:41,579 --> 01:43:47,880
got you you know like the sour was

2539
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:49,800
Stronger on it and you know like

2540
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:53,699
we could keep Crossing it back to the

2541
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:56,699
chemdog and it just

2542
01:43:53,698 --> 01:43:57,779
I was never satisfied with what what we

2543
01:43:56,698 --> 01:44:00,000
had gotten

2544
01:43:57,779 --> 01:44:03,118
you know I didn't think it was just like

2545
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,658
in the beginning phases of of the

2546
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:08,939
project you know of breeding and so

2547
01:44:06,658 --> 01:44:11,759
what's interesting about that is that

2548
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:13,019
and wait let me just say this real fast

2549
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:17,460
so

2550
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:22,619
the name not so dog I have strains

2551
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:24,719
called the NSD not so dog okay and it

2552
01:44:22,618 --> 01:44:28,139
would be like NSD one two three four

2553
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:29,760
five you know and

2554
01:44:28,139 --> 01:44:32,699
because

2555
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:35,880
there were never doglike enough that's

2556
01:44:32,698 --> 01:44:37,678
hilarious so that's why I say like

2557
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:39,960
you know

2558
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:41,520
I think I'm part of the story and I I

2559
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:44,698
met people

2560
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:46,139
that you know we were all together at

2561
01:44:44,698 --> 01:44:47,759
this time

2562
01:44:46,139 --> 01:44:51,060
you know

2563
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:54,060
so I mean like you didn't really go into

2564
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:56,820
detail on sour like you mentioned

2565
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:59,039
meeting Club but when people may not

2566
01:44:56,819 --> 01:45:03,139
know by extension is that klopp is the

2567
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:03,139
sour guy the diesel guy you know

2568
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,260
that's why that's why when we're talking

2569
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:15,179
about it when we're talking about it

2570
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:16,199
about the the AJ sour sure okay I

2571
01:45:15,179 --> 01:45:17,880
thought that that was the stuff that

2572
01:45:16,198 --> 01:45:21,359
came from clock

2573
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:22,199
you know and you know maybe they you

2574
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:25,439
know

2575
01:45:22,198 --> 01:45:27,779
had rejuvenated it to me sure as we said

2576
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,719
that rejuvenated

2577
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:31,738
but you know made some but I think I

2578
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,000
thought that that's where the stuff

2579
01:45:31,738 --> 01:45:36,899
originally came

2580
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:39,238
from and I do like the story that

2581
01:45:36,899 --> 01:45:40,799
Francis was telling about it being

2582
01:45:39,238 --> 01:45:44,519
accidental

2583
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:46,679
like yeah that's that's what I think all

2584
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:48,360
you know I think it was all true

2585
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:50,819
I can't like come on the show and say

2586
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:52,920
Francis you were wrong you got that

2587
01:45:50,819 --> 01:45:54,000
completely wrong most of it seemed

2588
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,980
pretty right up

2589
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,840
yeah that's good if he did though you

2590
01:45:55,979 --> 01:45:59,638
could you could say that

2591
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,020
I mean it does get it does get

2592
01:45:59,639 --> 01:46:02,400
interesting when you talk to different

2593
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:03,840
people because one of the things that

2594
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:05,698
Matt and I have learned is that when you

2595
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:08,760
take 20 year old memories and you start

2596
01:46:05,698 --> 01:46:10,859
comparing them what people remember and

2597
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:13,139
what stands out and like what there

2598
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:15,658
could be some some variations that they

2599
01:46:13,139 --> 01:46:18,600
remember things a little different like

2600
01:46:15,658 --> 01:46:20,158
you know the the NSD or whatever the

2601
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:23,280
whole reason why I came up with that

2602
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:24,899
name was because I was trying to join IG

2603
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:26,158
and every name I came up with they

2604
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:28,738
rejected

2605
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:31,019
I'll tell a story for a minute there was

2606
01:46:28,738 --> 01:46:33,299
this time where because there was only

2607
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:35,820
like four of us that had the dog

2608
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:38,520
a lot of times Gabby would go and he

2609
01:46:35,819 --> 01:46:40,319
would buy some dog off whoever had it

2610
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:42,659
the freshest

2611
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:45,118
and at the time

2612
01:46:42,658 --> 01:46:47,039
um our buddy icy Collective was living

2613
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:49,618
in Tahoe

2614
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:50,519
and Gabby went up to Tahoe and got some

2615
01:46:49,618 --> 01:46:52,859
dog

2616
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:56,280
and he came back and I remember going

2617
01:46:52,859 --> 01:46:58,139
out it was like dark and he picked me up

2618
01:46:56,279 --> 01:47:00,179
and we we was outside of willitz which

2619
01:46:58,139 --> 01:47:01,560
is a little town in Mendo and he's like

2620
01:47:00,179 --> 01:47:04,739
dude I want you to see this stuff it's

2621
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:06,480
wild and like so I'm in the dark and I

2622
01:47:04,738 --> 01:47:08,099
opened this bag and I stick my head in

2623
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:09,899
there and I'm like dude I don't know I

2624
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:11,940
don't know it doesn't remind me of the

2625
01:47:09,899 --> 01:47:14,039
dog it's not so it's not so dog I don't

2626
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:16,259
I don't know it doesn't and he was like

2627
01:47:14,039 --> 01:47:18,300
it looks so Frosty it's so amazing I

2628
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:20,699
can't believe it and I was like

2629
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:23,520
I think it's a different cut and it

2630
01:47:20,698 --> 01:47:24,719
turned out that icy had been partying a

2631
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,300
little bit and there must have been some

2632
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:30,179
kind of like strain mix up or label

2633
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:32,460
mistake or a clone screw up on some

2634
01:47:30,179 --> 01:47:34,859
level and he filled his entire room with

2635
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:36,020
what he thought was the dog and it

2636
01:47:34,859 --> 01:47:38,639
wasn't

2637
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:40,860
and I like remembered that it was like

2638
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:44,579
this random joke not so dog and so I

2639
01:47:40,859 --> 01:47:46,139
popped it into the IG and it worked and

2640
01:47:44,579 --> 01:47:47,279
I was like oh well I guess that's my

2641
01:47:46,139 --> 01:47:49,440
handle

2642
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:52,679
you know but yeah but what we were

2643
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:55,198
trying to do I I also named our seeds I

2644
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:57,658
also named our clones not so dog yeah I

2645
01:47:55,198 --> 01:48:00,599
mean remember the labels NSD one two

2646
01:47:57,658 --> 01:48:03,000
three four five and six we what we were

2647
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:06,539
trying to do is we were trying to get

2648
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:10,500
like the power and the density of the

2649
01:48:06,539 --> 01:48:13,260
dog in the same strain as like this we

2650
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:15,899
wanted like the frost of the skunk and

2651
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:17,880
like the stink and some of the Terps huh

2652
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:19,920
it's not gonna get confusing Frost of

2653
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:22,319
the skunk or the super skunk which came

2654
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:24,600
West Gabby

2655
01:48:22,319 --> 01:48:26,340
well that's something that this is super

2656
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:28,880
clear from Scentsy seeds was the one

2657
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,880
that was white

2658
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:33,060
so that could that could be empty seeds

2659
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:36,718
that [ __ ] was why

2660
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:39,480
so that could Veer us off because so I

2661
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:41,340
had I I think I I might and maybe I'm

2662
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:43,799
wrong maybe I've been operating under a

2663
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:44,880
misconception for a really long time

2664
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:48,179
but

2665
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:50,579
when when you in in that era when we met

2666
01:48:48,179 --> 01:48:54,420
and you gave me the dog and you gave me

2667
01:48:50,579 --> 01:48:58,679
the skunk did you give me the vas gunk

2668
01:48:54,420 --> 01:49:00,779
or did you give me a different skunk

2669
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:03,719
I was pretty sure

2670
01:49:00,779 --> 01:49:05,819
that you had given me the VA skunk

2671
01:49:03,719 --> 01:49:08,158
because when we grew it together all

2672
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:10,079
those times you would tell me the story

2673
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:11,638
and you would never be like oh I lost

2674
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:14,219
that one but I have this different one

2675
01:49:11,639 --> 01:49:15,900
now that's really good

2676
01:49:14,219 --> 01:49:18,719
well there was the skunk and there was

2677
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:21,479
the super skunk from Scentsy seeds we

2678
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:23,279
did buy some of those seeds

2679
01:49:21,479 --> 01:49:26,218
so which one would you compare to the

2680
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:28,079
the one in the catalog

2681
01:49:26,219 --> 01:49:30,139
well that was the super skunk from

2682
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:32,760
Scentsy seeds

2683
01:49:30,139 --> 01:49:34,679
I mean he's telling you the story that

2684
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,060
you would look at the picture you'd look

2685
01:49:34,679 --> 01:49:38,760
at the picture and hold it up next to

2686
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:41,639
your buds and you'd be like yeah

2687
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:44,460
oh yeah we would get Gabby had original

2688
01:49:41,639 --> 01:49:48,359
copies of Neville's

2689
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:51,179
um Neville's uh uh catalogs there I am

2690
01:49:48,359 --> 01:49:54,179
sorry about that uh Gabby had original

2691
01:49:51,179 --> 01:49:55,800
copies of Neville's catalogs and like we

2692
01:49:54,179 --> 01:49:58,380
would clip off when we were gardening

2693
01:49:55,800 --> 01:50:00,960
together we would clip off side nugs off

2694
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:01,859
the off skunk and hold it up to the

2695
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,039
picture

2696
01:50:01,859 --> 01:50:10,738
and Gabby would be like yep that's it

2697
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:14,039
and it would look exactly like to the T

2698
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:16,019
what was on that picture so did the VA

2699
01:50:14,039 --> 01:50:17,100
skunk look exactly like the one in the

2700
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:21,360
catalog that's what we're trying to

2701
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:23,219
figure out no I don't think so

2702
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:25,738
you know like I said it was unbelievable

2703
01:50:23,219 --> 01:50:28,560
how uniform the [ __ ] was and exactly

2704
01:50:25,738 --> 01:50:31,439
like when you pop it was the only time

2705
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:35,520
ever in the history of the universe that

2706
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:39,000
somebody pops a seed and gets exactly

2707
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:41,639
what they're expecting yeah I mean it

2708
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:44,939
was like why would I keep all 10 of them

2709
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:49,020
when this one is exactly

2710
01:50:44,939 --> 01:50:50,879
what I'm wanting sure you know so so

2711
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:53,699
there was the seed grown Scentsy stuff

2712
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:55,440
and then there was the VA the the Clone

2713
01:50:53,698 --> 01:50:57,839
that we picked up

2714
01:50:55,439 --> 01:51:00,960
so what I don't know picked up was far

2715
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:04,260
in advance of the census

2716
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:07,520
is what you know is what I got from you

2717
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:07,520
at your house in Sonoma

2718
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:16,799
I lost it when I got in trouble

2719
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:19,320
uh

2720
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:22,320
and I didn't have and at that time that

2721
01:51:19,319 --> 01:51:24,059
was like the Kush Sour Diesel era and it

2722
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:25,859
was like nobody was interested in Old

2723
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:27,960
cuts and it was really hard to get stuff

2724
01:51:25,859 --> 01:51:30,658
backed up

2725
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,920
so I've been hunting it for a million

2726
01:51:30,658 --> 01:51:34,738
years

2727
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:36,539
and I pull on strings

2728
01:51:34,738 --> 01:51:38,579
super skunk

2729
01:51:36,539 --> 01:51:40,198
I think you could put that [ __ ] next to

2730
01:51:38,579 --> 01:51:41,579
any weed today

2731
01:51:40,198 --> 01:51:43,259
and

2732
01:51:41,579 --> 01:51:44,819
you know

2733
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:47,460
have a look

2734
01:51:44,819 --> 01:51:49,920
have the nose

2735
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:52,139
is pretty much perfect weed

2736
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:54,719
as close as you can get to it

2737
01:51:52,139 --> 01:51:56,819
I love it one thing I disagreed with you

2738
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:58,020
about on the podcast was when you were

2739
01:51:56,819 --> 01:52:00,679
talking about

2740
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:00,679
you know

2741
01:52:00,899 --> 01:52:05,879
it's all about the potency

2742
01:52:03,539 --> 01:52:08,760
and I agree that it was some of the most

2743
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:12,239
potent weed of its time

2744
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:14,460
but what made the chem dog amazing was

2745
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:18,479
the terp profile

2746
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:21,658
and that's what I wanted out of the

2747
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:23,399
breeding project was to get because I

2748
01:52:21,658 --> 01:52:25,379
wanted to get some vigor

2749
01:52:23,399 --> 01:52:26,519
and because the chem dog was such a

2750
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:28,920
hurting plant

2751
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:30,600
yeah you know I I think the way you

2752
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:33,000
described it was accurate Matt you said

2753
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:35,340
the plant would consume itself yeah

2754
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,380
before you'd finish it like he was just

2755
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:40,560
trying to finish and still have a green

2756
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:42,600
leaf on it not like you know like it's

2757
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:45,060
two weeks to go everything is yellow

2758
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:48,480
you're not done yet but like this plant

2759
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:49,920
is dying you know it was it was a

2760
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:51,839
difficult plant to grow and we didn't

2761
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,940
have the resources that we did do today

2762
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,940
you know like

2763
01:52:53,939 --> 01:53:00,658
if I was growing the chem dog today I

2764
01:52:56,939 --> 01:53:04,379
would definitely do leaf tissue analysis

2765
01:53:00,658 --> 01:53:07,979
you know during the crop to see what

2766
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:10,560
it's taking and because that's smart

2767
01:53:07,979 --> 01:53:13,500
back in the day we were guessing

2768
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:16,219
yeah we didn't have these resources and

2769
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:20,399
we were failing I mean the funny part

2770
01:53:16,219 --> 01:53:22,139
you know now the chem dog grown to a

2771
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:23,879
point where it's gonna die

2772
01:53:22,139 --> 01:53:25,980
was still better

2773
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:28,980
than all the other wheat out there yeah

2774
01:53:25,979 --> 01:53:31,198
you know so he would do this thing where

2775
01:53:28,979 --> 01:53:34,678
he was fully organic when we met and I

2776
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:35,460
wasn't and uh he wouldn't call it chem

2777
01:53:34,679 --> 01:53:37,800
dog

2778
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:40,920
because he's like I grow organic I'm not

2779
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:42,060
going to call my weed chem you know but

2780
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,859
then there would be this funny thing

2781
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:47,280
where he'd look at me and he goes but it

2782
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:49,920
does like GH3 part and it won't eat

2783
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:51,840
itself quite as much if you needed that

2784
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,940
you know that's because that's what Greg

2785
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:55,800
was doing

2786
01:53:53,939 --> 01:53:58,319
okay well other people were doing like

2787
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:59,639
when I was organic I never had done the

2788
01:53:58,319 --> 01:54:02,460
hydro

2789
01:53:59,639 --> 01:54:04,199
you know yeah so

2790
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:06,420
so I'll tell this part of the story

2791
01:54:04,198 --> 01:54:08,099
briefly

2792
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:09,239
um this is part of the story that I like

2793
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:12,179
to tell

2794
01:54:09,238 --> 01:54:14,339
is you know Greg called it the chem dog

2795
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:17,579
and he specifically told me you have to

2796
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:19,079
grow this one chem because it's so hard

2797
01:54:17,579 --> 01:54:21,179
to defeated you'll never get a

2798
01:54:19,079 --> 01:54:23,399
successful crop out of it if you try to

2799
01:54:21,179 --> 01:54:26,158
you know grow it organic and for me that

2800
01:54:23,399 --> 01:54:29,939
was like a challenge sure I was like

2801
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:33,359
well I'm definitely not gonna grow it

2802
01:54:29,939 --> 01:54:34,799
using Hydra you know

2803
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:39,479
and

2804
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:42,239
man I used to do so much trying to feed

2805
01:54:39,479 --> 01:54:45,118
my plants indoors

2806
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:47,638
you know with Organics I not only had

2807
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:51,299
like guano teas but I used to make like

2808
01:54:47,639 --> 01:54:53,060
vegetable scrap teas and all this nasty

2809
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:56,100
like

2810
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:57,139
anaerobic [ __ ] going on like smelled so

2811
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:59,760
bad

2812
01:54:57,139 --> 01:55:02,159
doing whatever I could trying to feed my

2813
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:07,920
plants organically

2814
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:12,599
and one day I read on the back of this

2815
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:16,699
flyer from a hydro nutrient company it

2816
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:19,199
was a actually uh green Air Products

2817
01:55:16,698 --> 01:55:21,719
that never was successful

2818
01:55:19,198 --> 01:55:22,859
but on the back of the whole thing and

2819
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:25,439
they were explaining what's the

2820
01:55:22,859 --> 01:55:28,079
difference between organic and inorganic

2821
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:29,519
okay and you know so inorganic is

2822
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:33,658
minerals

2823
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:36,739
and Organics are minerals mineral

2824
01:55:33,658 --> 01:55:38,279
compounds that are held together

2825
01:55:36,738 --> 01:55:41,279
bicarbon

2826
01:55:38,279 --> 01:55:45,059
and that they need to be broken down

2827
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:48,000
into that more mineral form

2828
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:50,699
for the plant to uptake it yeah and then

2829
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,279
it says the minerals

2830
01:55:50,698 --> 01:55:55,019
are the building blocks of all life on

2831
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:56,779
the planet

2832
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:59,520
you know and out

2833
01:55:56,779 --> 01:56:01,139
it was like a a moment for me when a

2834
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:04,380
light switch went on and I was like oh

2835
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:07,560
maybe I need to try this

2836
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:09,179
and I did you know and I don't think it

2837
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,920
was the GH3 part at first I don't even

2838
01:56:09,179 --> 01:56:13,199
think that [ __ ] existed

2839
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:14,819
you know it was like a general

2840
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:16,079
hydroponics they had like a three-part

2841
01:56:14,819 --> 01:56:19,679
powder

2842
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:21,479
it's like a a micro and then the grow

2843
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:23,158
with a bloom

2844
01:56:21,479 --> 01:56:24,539
and um

2845
01:56:23,158 --> 01:56:26,819
yeah but

2846
01:56:24,539 --> 01:56:30,060
the first time I fed my plants Hydro

2847
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:32,399
nutrients even in like a cocoa or peat

2848
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:34,940
moss type stuff

2849
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:34,939
okay

2850
01:56:35,219 --> 01:56:38,819
you know and

2851
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:41,100
what I did and what I still believe to

2852
01:56:38,819 --> 01:56:42,420
this day is the best is using mineral

2853
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:44,460
nutrients

2854
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:46,800
and adding some Organics

2855
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:49,139
that way you know you're giving the

2856
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:51,719
plants everything that it needs right

2857
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:52,679
and then you can give it some things

2858
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:55,859
that

2859
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:58,079
it appreciates and a little humility not

2860
01:56:55,859 --> 01:57:01,079
thinking like we know plants only need

2861
01:56:58,079 --> 01:57:02,579
16 elements well yeah now we know when

2862
01:57:01,079 --> 01:57:05,340
we give the plant silica they benefit

2863
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:06,479
from it they may not die without it but

2864
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,920
if you're trying to get the highest

2865
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:10,079
quality product

2866
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:12,239
it's helpful you know when you can use

2867
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:14,880
properly and so

2868
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:18,658
um yeah that's what I try to do is use

2869
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:20,460
minerals add some organic additives

2870
01:57:18,658 --> 01:57:23,460
um compost tea

2871
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:25,380
you know when you can do that

2872
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:26,819
um that's how I think you get the best

2873
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:28,139
quality

2874
01:57:26,819 --> 01:57:31,099
and

2875
01:57:28,139 --> 01:57:34,679
quality and quantity I agree

2876
01:57:31,099 --> 01:57:36,539
out of an indoor grill and the other

2877
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:37,980
thing that I'll say is

2878
01:57:36,539 --> 01:57:39,899
and I'm gonna have to let you guys go in

2879
01:57:37,979 --> 01:57:42,118
a few minutes but no worries I can

2880
01:57:39,899 --> 01:57:44,098
finish with this part is

2881
01:57:42,118 --> 01:57:45,539
a lot of people think they're growing

2882
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:48,179
organic

2883
01:57:45,539 --> 01:57:51,679
because they have a like 100 gallon

2884
01:57:48,179 --> 01:57:55,920
smart pot filled with ocean forest soil

2885
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:57,658
right and and I give give it just water

2886
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,739
and they think that their product is

2887
01:57:57,658 --> 01:58:00,779
superior

2888
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:03,839
because they didn't use any nutrients

2889
01:58:00,779 --> 01:58:04,920
sure like just because they made it to

2890
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:08,279
harvest

2891
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:10,079
you know I don't think if I think if

2892
01:58:08,279 --> 01:58:13,939
you're growing in a container

2893
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:13,939
and you're trying to grow organically

2894
01:58:14,219 --> 01:58:18,658
I think you're kidding yourself if you

2895
01:58:16,198 --> 01:58:22,019
think that you're getting the best

2896
01:58:18,658 --> 01:58:24,000
like the most nutritious food out of it

2897
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:25,980
yeah the most nutritious medicinal

2898
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,840
product out of it

2899
01:58:25,979 --> 01:58:31,138
yeah now

2900
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:34,860
to take that to the next part is

2901
01:58:31,139 --> 01:58:38,460
I think the best medicine or food

2902
01:58:34,859 --> 01:58:42,118
will be grown in the ground with soil

2903
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:44,579
that's been nurtured and loved so I

2904
01:58:42,118 --> 01:58:46,979
didn't become an organic snob to like

2905
01:58:44,579 --> 01:58:49,859
somebody that instantly went full-on Cam

2906
01:58:46,979 --> 01:58:51,359
and you know I think you know if you

2907
01:58:49,859 --> 01:58:53,399
nurture the land

2908
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:54,299
you know you can grow the most amazing

2909
01:58:53,399 --> 01:58:58,079
product

2910
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:59,820
directly in ground yeah you know if you

2911
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:02,880
have to go we can continue it tomorrow

2912
01:58:59,819 --> 01:59:06,799
too let's do that

2913
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:10,319
I'll tell one super quick story which is

2914
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:13,320
uh Gabby had gone to the Oregon Country

2915
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:15,359
Fair for a long time and so he used to

2916
01:59:13,319 --> 01:59:18,658
work there and so once we became really

2917
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:20,399
good friends he brought me up there a

2918
01:59:18,658 --> 01:59:23,219
number of years and I worked the cruise

2919
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:24,960
that he was already part of right and so

2920
01:59:23,219 --> 01:59:27,658
it's outside of Eugene or whatever and

2921
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:29,939
this was like the heart of organic weed

2922
01:59:27,658 --> 01:59:32,519
growing land yeah and I would come up

2923
01:59:29,939 --> 01:59:37,198
there with like my hydro super skunk and

2924
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:39,060
my hydro chem dog my hydro Mendo p and

2925
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:41,098
super dog that Gabby and I had made

2926
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:42,719
together and I was like the only one

2927
01:59:41,099 --> 01:59:45,719
there with salt weed and they were all

2928
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:47,880
like salt is terrible only cheating evil

2929
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:50,158
