it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,920
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,599
be joined by members of the can

got something please please do yeah the

33
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,319
night cap Exotica season 2 we just did a

34
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,159
run in the Arizona facility it was one

35
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,359
of the first actual like seed pop runs

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,840
that we did we selected a really

37
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,400
beautiful plant from that um so super

38
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,759
excited for her and then I have her and

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,600
new pollinations um the other ones that

40
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,078
are notable that I done recently is the

41
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,000
blue tint which is the blue dream to

42
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:34,158
Lemon kushman it's just more blueberry

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,680
it's like it's it's less Haze less musk

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,159
there's a little bit of it in there but

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,759
it really goes back to the true

46
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,600
blueberry um flavor and then the lemon

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,560
Cushman just kind of compacted things a

48
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,280
little bit made it tighter and gives a

49
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,478
little more bling there's a nice color

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,439
element to it as well and the ones I

51
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:52,560
like the best I'm finding the blueberry

52
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,078
up front and then a really nice lemon on

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
the exhale that's kind of like trick

54
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,199
cereal you ever get the lemon on trick

55
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,399
cereal yep that's that you can find that

56
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,880
in Irene and all kinds of stuff like

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,239
that too yeah I love that I've

58
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,359
experienced it before and I love that

59
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,640
it's when they're growing there's a

60
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,239
little bubblegum in it but it kind of

61
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,038
goes away after the Cure I don't taste

62
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,919
it um but I really really really enjoy

63
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,759
smoking that and then um The Onion baji

64
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,199
which is the chem4 Sunshine Daydream

65
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,719
crossed lemon Cushman that is the

66
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:23,399
nastiest thing that I have smelled in so

67
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,719
long it's cheesier than cheese um there

68
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,920
was a cut in organ called the silver if

69
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,519
you guys ever had that one that was like

70
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,799
it was a it was a haze it might have

71
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,959
been it might they call it super silver

72
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,920
also or or no they call it Sil Silver

73
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,840
Surfer also that sounds familiar though

74
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,679
that really does yeah so I had a little

75
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,479
sample green bod shared a little sample

76
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,800
with me and and it was like I remember

77
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,479
in the 90s in Cleveland getting this bag

78
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,120
of weed that's I thought it smelled like

79
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,439
sewage fruit that's what I called it it

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,560
was like pukey it was like puke and and

81
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,919
uh and fru at the end of it it was so

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,920
disgusting I remember having it under

83
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,359
the car like under my seat of my car not

84
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,238
taking it in my house I was coming back

85
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,680
into my car later and the whole car

86
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,239
[ __ ] stunk it was the most righteous

87
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,760
[ __ ] ever I've never saw it before or

88
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,560
after I got it one time and then when I

89
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,639
when H green bod gifted me some of the

90
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,120
flower from the from the Silver Surfer I

91
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,559
was like that's it it's [ __ ] that and

92
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,280
one of the other dudes on the Discord

93
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,479
knows about the silver he's been asking

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,400
about it I've never been able to get a

95
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,479
cut of it um but the onion baji really

96
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,879
mimics it it is like white cheddar

97
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,438
popcorn onions body odor and there's

98
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,239
just a touch of bubble gum when it's

99
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,840
growing like Northern Lighty kind of

100
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,039
bubblegum yeah yeah background um it's

101
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,519
the stinkiest thing it tests really high

102
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,079
which I don't generally care about but I

103
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,640
do have a job to do and that's part of

104
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,840
part of the job kind important so um it

105
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,318
does test really high it's a bell ringer

106
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,360
for me it it's very heady it smokes like

107
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,119
a haze like a really strong Haze um but

108
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,360
it's just [ __ ] phenomenal so that's

109
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,680
that's the one I'm reversing right now

110
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,920
and that's gonna I'm going to hit all my

111
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,079
new Cuts with that I'm going to hit a

112
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,318
lot of the um current stuff I have in

113
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:08,319
the stable I got a lot of um just old

114
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:10,399
ogs and you know chem and Kush varieties

115
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,878
um a lot of new stuff as well I think it

116
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,158
will blend really well with both the

117
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,560
kind of hey hazes and the ogs and the

118
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,120
Daner stuff just that flavor profile I

119
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,600
think is going to really lend itself to

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,120
some interesting crosses um so I just

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,680
finished the reversal of that um I'm

122
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,800
shedding pollen now we're probably I

123
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,120
don't know seven weeks from seed

124
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,560
maturation and then we'll do all the

125
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,079
pheno Hunts on site out there in Arizona

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,639
so that'll be a cool one and then um God

127
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,120
what else am I smoking I I uh I found so

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,038
I used the night piff which I had

129
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,918
mentioned earlier and I crossed that

130
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:47,478
into the purple Cav as well and we did a

131
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,680
run of about 50 in the facility and we

132
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:52,519
found one that is just completely unlike

133
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,720
all the others extremely dense and super

134
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,758
tight and one of the capis for THC and

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,479
cannaboid content is the density which I

136
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,160
just found that out from Mark Lewis

137
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,680
recently oh really

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,400
yeah so so you can sort of look at

139
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,160
density and have a correlation at least

140
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,239
with cannaboid content um and this this

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,320
rang true for this one too every other

142
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,160
plant that I tested from this cross was

143
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,199
like you know lower mid 20s kind of like

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,520
a 22 24 and this thing hit

145
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,560
29 smokes like a haze like the effect

146
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,000
again is different but the flavors there

147
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,038
it's very aty the mango is Stripped Away

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,639
entirely it's like old books and um and

149
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,639
leaves the incense trade in the air when

150
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,000
it burns that one I call the taser and

151
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,519
that's um kind of an homage to my buddy

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
who is the family that gave me the

153
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,478
purple Cass in the first place it's kind

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,800
of an homage to him and a little a

155
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,519
little thank you back but super excited

156
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,120
about that one as well and then um I did

157
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,719
do some land race

158
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,639
work um I got some purple trky from a

159
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,960
dude that used to be in the group yeah I

160
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,840
remember yeah moment he was passing

161
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,918
those out rosta rosta far yeah yeah so

162
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,519
um he gave me some purple trans I did I

163
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,799
did some I did pretty decent Siz hunt

164
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,000
with that actually in my backyard did

165
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,680
you find anything cool in there I did

166
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,759
yeah yeah so I did I did that and then I

167
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,959
was running um I was running some blue

168
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,319
Panama that was gifted to me from some

169
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,719
friends who I was working with at the

170
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,039
time that just got rid of all their

171
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,280
males and I found I found some really

172
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:23,439
nice like very very Haze like um stuff

173
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,598
in the blue Panama that I really enjoyed

174
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,918
and so I crossed that with the I called

175
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:29,000
it the selection I made for the purple

176
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,079
try was what I call Purple South African

177
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,478
or Ps say and it was like it's like

178
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,000
grape syrup super black the plant stays

179
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,439
green but the bud goes really really

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,519
dark and I used that you know just a

181
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,319
one-off cross when I did the land race

182
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,639
check I was looking for thcv stuff and

183
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,199
so I just did like a Solo Cup run you

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,519
know so in January I put all these

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,520
plants that were like you know this high

186
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,799
in Solo cups outside let them all go to

187
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,719
flower they all finish like this high

188
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,680
with one megabutt on the whole thing and

189
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
um and did selections from there just

190
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,680
reved right out of the Solo Cup which

191
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,360
was super easy I was able to do like

192
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,280
basically 500 plants in like I don't

193
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,400
know 8 by eight area in my backyard I

194
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,918
had to water many times a day with a

195
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,318
hand can my my son was young at the time

196
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,719
he was helping me out just watering them

197
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
all the time literally like need to be

198
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,120
watered constantly and a cool thing I

199
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,840
learned from that is if you do that and

200
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,478
you do a pollination in the early spring

201
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,198
you can actually let everything rev the

202
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,038
seeds will finish and then you can take

203
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,000
cuts off the plant again yep I love

204
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,120
doing that that was just unutilized

205
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,639
technique but it's it's it's great yeah

206
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,918
I mean that was an easy way to hit

207
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,800
numbers grow really small plants

208
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,758
contained to some degree and then I

209
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,478
could pollinate everything and then

210
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,879
still get the cut off the clone of the

211
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,758
best one at the end of the day yeah

212
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,560
seeds from it so that was a good

213
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,000
learning experience there um but so

214
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,839
recently in the facility I I have I I

215
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,120
crossed the blue Panama into the purple

216
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,839
South Africa

217
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,199
and have run the seeds from that and

218
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,279
found some really interesting stuff

219
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,319
actually they're super sensitive though

220
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,519
to the high ppfd and high EC that we run

221
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,439
in the facility just being like an

222
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:15,279
indoor grow um so it's G to need some

223
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,800
taming but it is like magenta the whole

224
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,198
bud turned super dark and it smelled

225
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,520
like foot cheese it was like tow jaming

226
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,038
it was disgusting but it was like

227
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,359
disgusting in the best possible way so

228
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:29,318
actually I'm I'm the onion baji is going

229
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,560
to hit that land rice genetic also which

230
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,599
just be a [ __ ] disgusting stinkfest

231
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,038
so I'm excited for that but the land

232
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,919
race work is honestly the interesting

233
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,199
thing I think is my my ideas early on

234
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,158
were that you know hermaphrodites are

235
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,240
sort of like a modern cannabis problem

236
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:48,480
you know sex issues or due to bad

237
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,759
breeding practices people using bag seed

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,480
and blah blah blah BL blah and in the

239
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,399
land race stuff that I've run I found

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,080
more Herms in land race consistently

241
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,360
than I have in just general modern

242
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,120
cannabis drains yeah which I thought

243
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,800
really because it just kind of you know

244
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,799
took that idea and smashed it for

245
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,439
me they're a little finicky and

246
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,120
definitely lower lower cannaboid content

247
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,720
it's hard to find something from the

248
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,919
land race that's really really good I

249
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,600
did run the the black African magic

250
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,120
recently um that was pretty interesting

251
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,839
where did you find something that

252
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,560
someone labeled that so Kora genetics

253
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,920
has some um yep Kora um I can send you a

254
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:32,039
link I grew him out I got a bunch of

255
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,599
pictures they were really interesting um

256
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,399
definitely L racy tighter in some of

257
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,480
them some dark colors kind of a cherry

258
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,679
luden smell on the best of them the rest

259
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,720
of them were very haylike and yeah you

260
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,519
know not much to speak about um the labs

261
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,959
in Arizona aren't quite sophisticated

262
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,560
enough to really pick up on some of the

263
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,399
minor cannaboids and so we were looking

264
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,078
for thcv in those and and didn't pick

265
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,639
any up but that doesn't mean that it

266
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,359
didn't have it it's just I don't think

267
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,919
the labs are actually capable of testing

268
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,039
for it out here quite yet yeah

269
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,759
so I did run those those recently as

270
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,120
well and and since then honestly I'm

271
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,078
just going back to my regular work

272
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,360
because I think there's more uh more

273
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,799
value and do do you know the history

274
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,278
behind the African black magic the the

275
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,199
mythology and whatnot yeah yeah I've

276
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,559
read about it a little bit and obviously

277
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,920
when those were passed to me super

278
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:22,439
skeptical and you know not going to call

279
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,519
anybody anything you know no no it's

280
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,200
it's it's not even that realistically

281
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,480
like the first time I ever saw it

282
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,120
referenced was DJ schar's book yeah and

283
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,039
he described it as some weed he was

284
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,959
brought that looked like crumbled pieces

285
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,319
of [ __ ] you know like

286
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,359
brown but had thick thick heavy dark

287
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,680
smoke and [ __ ] him up like nothing

288
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,560
ever and I think with Modern Eyes

289
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,239
reading that like knowledge he would

290
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,759
realize that's just African cob like

291
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,399
Malawi cob you know yeah right so I

292
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,679
think really it's the African black

293
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,480
magic really is a process of how it's

294
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,479
dried and cured as opposed to a specific

295
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,680
straight gotcha yeah that makes sense

296
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,759
yeah I mean I don't know what the origin

297
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,159
of these are outside of what he told me

298
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,720
um sounds interesting though I like

299
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,240
Africans you know yeah I still I'll send

300
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,160
you some I still have some yeah that's

301
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,079
cool yeah yeah it was interesting I mean

302
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,958
I like the Mala a lot I I really like

303
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:16,719
the South African stuff that I grew um

304
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,599
from rosta I I enjoyed all that I enjoy

305
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,320
the smoke of all this stuff it's just I

306
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,800
find that if I'm smoking a lot of land R

307
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,639
stuff I'll end up finishing and capping

308
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,000
off with something modern to sort of get

309
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,600
that effect back I know what you mean I

310
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,600
definitely know what you mean I think

311
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,320
also in in modern times and uh newer

312
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,759
Growers the idea of land races sounds

313
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
really exotic and unique and cool see

314
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,000
something like that that isn't in the

315
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,839
modern cannabis world but like in theory

316
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,078
or that's in theory but in practice like

317
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,240
it takes big pops a lot of it's going to

318
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:50,319
smell like hay not be applicable to

319
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,879
indoor grows not finish in any time that

320
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,360
they're comfortable with there's so much

321
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,799
that goes to it but it's it's great

322
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,079
seeing people take hold of it that know

323
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,039
what they're getting into and really

324
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,000
giving these things a shot seeing what's

325
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,240
in there and be willing to to go through

326
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,919
the hard work and and big Pops to find

327
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,560
it I admire that yeah I think that's

328
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:08,439
it's it's restrictive for big pops

329
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,838
because of those a for aformentioned

330
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,920
reasons I think I can get away with big

331
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,279
pops with the more modern stuff that's

332
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,919
going to test well because I can always

333
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,278
homogenize into some pre-rolls or make

334
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,519
some extract or whatever where the land

335
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:23,399
Ray stuff I'm probably not going to get

336
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,919
more than one pass on that yep so I'm

337
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,679
GNA grow this out I mean the the

338
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,719
selection I made from these I'm going to

339
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,799
grow out we just took a clone run of it

340
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,519
um

341
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,240
today actually so I'm going to continue

342
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,440
down that line and see what's there I

343
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,120
don't think it's going to be a high test

344
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,720
or anything but it is the truth of

345
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,919
exotic you know it is exotic and this

346
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,720
this plant is really unique and the

347
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,198
smell of it is not like anything that

348
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,240
you smell in modern cannabis generally

349
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:52,278
so it'll be interesting to see if I can

350
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,839
make it work at all yeah I think you can

351
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:58,600
with enough time enough uh dedication

352
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,320
you absolutely can I mean a lot of me

353
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,680
you know I say that again it's future

354
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,920
breeding work it's like something I want

355
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,439
to add in to get something novel out and

356
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,360
absolutely sometimes it's okay if

357
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,279
something if the the purpose of a plant

358
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,919
is just a building block you know

359
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,159
absolutely

360
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:18,399
absolutely yeah so for you yeah very

361
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,719
much a means more than an end in itself

362
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,039
at least at the moment right yeah yeah I

363
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,040
mean it's part of the enjoyment that

364
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,319
keeps me going you know it's part of the

365
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,958
it's part of the learning experience

366
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,879
it's part of the exploration it's part

367
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,239
of the discovery of what's interesting

368
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,439
about being in the Cannabis industry so

369
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,159
I'll keep growing them and keep trying

370
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,000
to Source them of course um that dude

371
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,799
also gave me some Chinese seeds that are

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,519
they're as big as like BB's they're the

373
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,958
biggest seeds I've ever seen in my life

374
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,679
wow they're massive dude they're like

375
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,119
it's crazy that sounds cool though yeah

376
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,120
he's got he's got an extensive land race

377
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,480
collection he did a lot of work in

378
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,839
Switzerland so I think he had a lot of

379
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,959
connections through there um and it did

380
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,120
a lot of work in Africa too so he's got

381
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,198
some interesting connections he's a

382
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,480
really interesting guy he's accessible

383
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,399
he's definitely an OG and uh and knows

384
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,278
his [ __ ] um so shout out cor genetics I

385
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,679
definitely recommend oh yeah yeah they

386
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,759
have some cool [ __ ] man he's a cool guy

387
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,719
I think they were even the ones that

388
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,159
were doing like Viking and stuff like

389
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,480
that like redoing bringing back some

390
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,480
really obscure rare [ __ ] I I think it's

391
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,720
great man yeah that's his whole his

392
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,120
whole thing is obscure and rare which I

393
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,240
appreciate was that is that bald man laa

394
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,240
running it no his name's Hardy okay I'm

395
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,360
not familiar I I knew there was like La

396
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
La in the collective and monkey and a

397
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,839
few others that I knew but I'm not

398
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,519
familiar with that dude not familiar

399
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,720
with who who's in his Circle or isn't

400
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,480
I've crossed with him a couple times and

401
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,320
we were kind of in in similar circles

402
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,159
and and he was um you know generous

403
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,600
enough to give me with some stuff and

404
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,120
that's cool man and likewise I'll I'll

405
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,000
do the same back to him till the end of

406
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,639
time because he's I I appreciate that

407
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,600
about the community you know oh yeah H

408
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,839
yeah that's awesome and yeah thanks so

409
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,399
much for telling us about those uh those

410
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,240
projects yeah um was there any more

411
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,278
recent work you wanted to highlight

412
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,879
because otherwise I wanted to get into

413
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,399
like maybe a broader discussion on the

414
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,519
industry and and your thoughts on

415
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,078
certain

416
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,278
things

417
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,758
um what else have I been doing that's

418
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,039
interesting I mean it's I I'm I'm

419
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,079
running a line now called red bananas

420
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,120
which is an offshoot and um has some

421
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,559
more modern stuff in it but keeping true

422
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,360
with the banana line um like the red

423
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,919
bananas a lot it's a great extract plant

424
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,278
as well I don't know always popping new

425
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,278
season it's always the next thing you

426
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,879
know that's the thing is like as much as

427
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,439
I complain about the fickle nature of

428
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,919
the uh of the like the retail consumer

429
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,199
that we're always selling to it's like

430
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:44,240
I'm the same way I like I want thing and

431
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:46,078
so as soon as one Project's done it's

432
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,240
kind of onto the next but I'm really

433
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,919
excited now to be um to be pollinating

434
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,120
again because I've had a Hiatus on that

435
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,039
for a while so that's really the focus

436
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,480
will be on really collecting um some

437
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,559
better hard data on reversal

438
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,639
specifically and um I am offering a DIY

439
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,039
reversal kit nowadays so something

440
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,600
really simple just to let people make it

441
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,159
at home and figure that out but what I

442
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
want to do to be able to support that a

443
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,919
little bit more is specific like ml

444
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,240
dosages um you know for how much you're

445
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,639
going to need to get a successful

446
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,159
reversal and what types of plans do

447
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,120
better with this or that what's the

448
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,159
minimum apply you know maybe you should

449
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,198
talk to

450
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:26,198
fadan yeah everybody's getting into the

451
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:28,278
the spray market and I'm trying to get

452
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,519
out I mean I'm not really getting you

453
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,399
know what done is a lot of times when

454
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,039
people when people support I've I've

455
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,519
offered it as a freebie like I'll give

456
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,120
you a kid as a freebie because I have a

457
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,360
shitload of it um so it's more just that

458
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,240
and and I don't know I think it's like

459
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,759
in the same way that as a as a director

460
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,639
of cultivation I have to be very open

461
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,079
and um and supportive of hom Growers you

462
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,680
know which for sure most people who are

463
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,039
in that who are in that that position

464
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,519
they want to sell them all their weed

465
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,879
and that's not really what it's really

466
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,959
about for me so in the same way that I

467
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,318
want to support hom Growers I want to

468
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,439
support other breeders too I don't

469
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,678
really have any secrets that I don't

470
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,558
also share um any Tech I share and so

471
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,679
the same thing with if you need access

472
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,359
to those types of chemicals to be able

473
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,519
to do a reversal or information on how

474
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:15,078
to do it I'm pretty much an open book so

475
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,679
it's just a it's not really a business

476
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:21,720
venture by any means it's just something

477
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,559
else that I have Shar to share yeah it's

478
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,519
it it is like one of those gate kept

479
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:27,959
type things for a long time I remember

480
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,639
even back on overgrow was a huge it was

481
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,360
hard to get people's like data what they

482
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,480
were actually putting in their spray to

483
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,678
reverse like people it was all smoking

484
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,000
mirrors and and nowadays you can find

485
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,200
the info really easy and it's just a

486
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,119
little bit of like especially for me

487
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,798
because I wasn't a chemist like I I did

488
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,199
horrible in chemistry in high school it

489
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,599
was just about doing it trying it not

490
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,679
being scared to fail you know and I

491
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,480
think that's the biggest thing to

492
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,600
overcome with reversals not being scared

493
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,720
to fail there's going to be failure you

494
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,759
will have success too yeah I I learned a

495
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,360
lot from from doing the so many so many

496
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,359
at a time yeah at the time when I was

497
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,319
pumping out the seeds it was like I

498
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,399
would have a general population area

499
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:10,038
that I would do the STS sprays and also

500
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,440
the seed maturation that was just always

501
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:14,759
on a 1212 time and then I would have

502
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,080
four additional Chambers off to the side

503
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,279
so as soon as that group of plants that

504
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,918
was going to be a donor was ready to

505
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,158
reverse they'd go in the tent and the

506
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,799
plants that were going to be U met by

507
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:24,960
them would be in the tent with them

508
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,759
they'd go through their pollination

509
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,880
phase then I'd pull I'd call the males

510
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,519
or call the reversed and pull everything

511
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,400
else into the general population area

512
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,038
and just let everything mature there and

513
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,480
then refill the 10 and keep doing that

514
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:37,319
so I had four of those at a time and was

515
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,640
just going Perpetual seed making seed

516
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,639
making seed making so learned a lot

517
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,038
about in a quick amount of time about

518
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,919
how much to apply when to apply how far

519
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,558
in advance to your flower date can you

520
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,880
start to apply to get those numbers up

521
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,399
in the plant um just some interesting

522
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,039
different techniques and things like

523
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,519
that so and again I just to reiterate

524
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,599
too I learned more about breeding from

525
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,400
from autof flowers than anything else by

526
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,839
far and it's absolutely because there's

527
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,360
like there's a well one there's a can't

528
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,839
miss scenario the selection is easy

529
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,240
right because if you just keep it on 16

530
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,079
hours and it and it flowers you have an

531
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,440
Autoflower if it doesn't you don't have

532
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:16,720
the trait so selections on that end are

533
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,159
really easy because you can just do a

534
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,839
wide swathing spray and anything that

535
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,400
doesn't reverse isn't going to go into

536
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:24,959
flower and will'll never create pollin

537
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
to hit anything so it's like that's a

538
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,558
lot of learnings in autof flowers and

539
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,080
and even more so recessive traits and

540
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:34,279
the heritability of those absolutely is

541
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:38,279
really important today for everyone

542
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:41,599
who's seeking the roadkill skunk if it

543
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:44,079
is you cannot find it in an F1 you're

544
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,480
going to have to go down your line and

545
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,279
you're gonna have to do some [ __ ]

546
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,919
work and put in some effort if you want

547
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,879
to try to find that so anyone selling F1

548
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,559
seeds as like a roadkill skunk I think

549
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,919
like that's if it's recessive and it's

550
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,759
looking like it is I think it is I do

551
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:02,600
think it is right

552
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:05,279
so anyways um enough about Auto flowers

553
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,000
you know a lot of times people will ask

554
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,519
me like in different interviews like

555
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,839
what what I think about autof flowers

556
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,639
and that's the first thing that I'll say

557
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,720
is like for learning breeding and

558
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,960
learning like heritability traits

559
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,640
because it's visual you can see it you

560
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,000
can act on it a lot of times some of

561
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,480
these things like the the autoflowering

562
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,798
dwarf type plants they're so fast to go

563
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,519
through the generations you can go

564
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,079
through successive Generations really

565
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,119
fast yeah you can learn a lot by doing

566
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,918
it I think that's like for for people

567
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,439
with small spaces that don't have a lot

568
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840
of money for electricity and all this

569
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,200
other stuff but they really want to

570
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,439
learn how to breed and breed correctly

571
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,159
and and what goes into that they're

572
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,000
perfect for it it's it's one of the best

573
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,600
teachers you can get it's one of the

574
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,480
only aspects of our industry that

575
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,959
actually is true breeding when you look

576
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,558
at just like gatekeeping and Crossing

577
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,679
one to another it's like this is a you

578
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:53,918
actually have to do work and a lot of

579
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,360
the work's already been done for you

580
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,799
because we already have Autoflower stock

581
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,639
to choose from but if you want to create

582
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:03,319
an Autoflower from a photo period in

583
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,559
Auto across you got to do a lot of work

584
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,759
yep it's a lot and and it is super

585
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:09,440
interesting and it could be also

586
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,038
wasteful if you're making them at scale

587
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,600
because when I was making autof flowers

588
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,038
I would only select the best of the best

589
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,240
plants that got pollinated to keep the

590
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:20,319
seed from everything else was bird food

591
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,240
you know like so I would create I don't

592
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,519
know a million seeds and keep maybe

593
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,319
120,000 or something like that because

594
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:31,119
everything else was just like traits I

595
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,359
want plants I didn't want I didn't want

596
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,278
the the it's it's open PW you know like

597
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,399
it's true open PAW like I don't want

598
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:38,759
that to continue into the Next

599
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,200
Generation so I leave those seeds behind

600
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,038
and that becomes bird food and

601
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,159
everything else carry on to the next one

602
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,960
and then keep doing that in a very

603
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,600
linear sense which is generally lost in

604
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,880
the Cannabis world as far as like

605
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,480
absolutely absolutely

606
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,520
is people don't like to walk from seeds

607
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,759
that they could possibly

608
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,879
sell well yeah I mean that's yeah and

609
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,640
that's the thing too is the uh like the

610
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,278
old adage who cares you know what I mean

611
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,320
like if if people are buying it and it's

612
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:08,519
not broken and they want your f1s and

613
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,000
they want your seeds and you don't have

614
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,440
to do any actual breeding work to have a

615
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,839
viable business or a viable brand or

616
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,880
whatever then who cares why even do it

617
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,519
you know there's no Val there's no value

618
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,919
added in that if you're already selling

619
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,879
a shill out of

620
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,720
seeds oh one thing that came to mind oh

621
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,080
sorry Matt do you want oh good good it

622
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,798
was going to change the subject though

623
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,079
so if you had anything no no good okay

624
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:35,558
um one thing I wasn't quite clear on how

625
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,119
much fem work do you do relative to

626
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:39,519
regular work I do all fem work now I

627
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,639
haven't done any regular work in a

628
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,000
couple years and mostly because the

629
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,120
facility I was working at there no male

630
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,079
plants they didn't want mail plants

631
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,599
there was no need for mail plants we

632
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:53,000
were we were breeding specifically and

633
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:56,399
Seed making specifically to be able to

634
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,558
grow multiple Acres outside from seed

635
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,200
and if you had male plants in there then

636
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,240
the value would be instantly lost

637
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,080
because you'd have to do so much

638
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,519
separation of the males or calling and

639
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,119
if they ever made it out to the crop

640
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:12,798
holy

641
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:15,278
[ __ ] yeah so all fem work from there um

642
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,400
you know doing some doing some cour work

643
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:20,240
at the um at the UC Davis seed biotech

644
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,080
really opened up my eyes of just the

645
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,798
value of fem work um in all breeding

646
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,158
lines and especially with cannabis

647
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,519
because you know you only have value in

648
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,919
the female flow

649
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,679
and so if you know the traits of the

650
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,080
female flower it's much easier to

651
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:35,840
predict the heritability and predict

652
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,558
what you're going to get out targeted

653
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:41,839
direct breeding at a at a fast rate yeah

654
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:45,240
so I've I've honestly gone completely

655
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,918
the other direction and um will probably

656
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,839
continue fem work for the rest of my

657
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,038
life and I don't see the value for me in

658
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,519
doing regular breeding today I think

659
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,158
there's a novel aspect that people want

660
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:58,960
to attach to it like I'm going to get

661
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,840
something different but again it's the

662
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,360
reality of breeding regular work is that

663
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,839
you need to grow out the progyny to know

664
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,319
which male use and if you're not doing

665
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:10,000
multiples if you don't have space for

666
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,599
that first of all which is extremely

667
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
restrictive then you're there's no

668
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,038
purpose at all um and if you're not

669
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,960
gonna actually do that what's the goal

670
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:22,960
you know if the goal is just to get a

671
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,000
great cup out or a clone only out then

672
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,360
why not just do fem anyway I agree and

673
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,038
and the market realistically too

674
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,038
regular Seed Market has completely

675
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:34,519
plummeted in the US where it used to be

676
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,119
Vice verse like the fem Market was a

677
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,000
really hard push when I was doing it

678
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,839
real big and regular seeds were

679
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,398
everything and there were all these uh

680
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,720
ideas that you know fem seeds were

681
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,519
subpar you would get subpar weed they

682
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,759
would all be Herms they would all you

683
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,720
know and I don't think that those are

684
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:52,278
are necessarily as attached as they used

685
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,759
to be and it seems to be a much bigger

686
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:55,679
demand for fans in the market now yeah

687
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,158
because so many people are doing it

688
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,399
people are doing big big hunts you know

689
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,480
you know I'm this is a Divergent a

690
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:05,519
little bit but the the biggest loss of

691
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,720
our community recently is the

692
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:11,119
genetic um availability going to these

693
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,278
massive you know corporations and msos

694
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,278
and absolutely um you know I'm I'm a

695
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,240
grower for an MSO myself it's not like a

696
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,759
big MSO it's not like a publicly traded

697
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,519
one it's not massive so there is a

698
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,599
startup and Grassroots um aspect to it

699
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,558
that I can really cling on to and enjoy

700
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,879
about what I'm doing now but when the

701
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,918
price of pounds fell so low everybody

702
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,480
started selling their genetics off and

703
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:37,960
yep you know if you got loose grips you

704
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,038
loose scripts sync ships man it's like

705
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,558
the whole industry is tanking because of

706
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,960
the availability of everything is

707
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:45,839
everywhere and so with that though I

708
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,000
think a lot of those msos and larger

709
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,959
outfits they do see the value in fem

710
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,919
seed and being able to run large numbers

711
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,640
and make selections for themselves and

712
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,640
I've sold a lot of them seeds so I know

713
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,038
what they're doing and yeah you know

714
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,520
that's that's what they're doing and

715
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,079
they'll pull out you know an S1 of

716
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,240
something and call it their cut of the

717
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,439
same thing which oh sure always have to

718
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,759
bend them over and spank them a little

719
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,919
bit for that it's so annoying yeah it is

720
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,640
annoying yeah but you know the other

721
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,960
reality that we have today is that we

722
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,480
have people that work in marketing

723
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,519
divisions who have never seen a plant or

724
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,399
touched a plant or had anything to do

725
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,158
with a plant no idea of the history and

726
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,759
the respect and credit that should be

727
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,440
given ahead of our own you know pumping

728
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,519
ourselves up sort of thing you know you

729
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,720
know I I heard about in Canada and this

730
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,000
is the first time it was like maybe a

731
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,759
year and a half ago when I first heard

732
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,240
about this and didn't realize it in

733
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:38,278
Canada the way the msos operate or I

734
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,278
should say msos multi- territory I don't

735
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:43,079
know what they're called over there but

736
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:44,720
like it's the buyers work for the

737
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,278
government and they're not people who

738
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,759
smoke or have any knowledge about

739
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:50,839
cannabis but they're the ones choosing

740
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,599
which strains get grown in their country

741
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:56,158
wow blows my [ __ ] mind like that's

742
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,119
crazy that's who's determining but

743
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,840
essentially it's determining what clones

744
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:02,199
get saved and held over time and it's

745
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,000
people have nothing to do with cannabis

746
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,519
doing that because like we saw in the

747
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,640
states um as things as rains tightened

748
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:11,038
and as cookies and gelato and Sh became

749
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,520
more in demand there became a point of

750
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,640
where people that that were keeping

751
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,599
these mom's rooms had to make that

752
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,960
conscious decision do I keep spending

753
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:23,558
money on electricity and time and energy

754
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,840
and soil medium Fe feed all that uh to

755
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,278
keep these moms alive that nobody's

756
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,158
buying the bud for anymore and I don't

757
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,200
see you know like that really happened

758
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:34,120
and that's that led to a great drop in

759
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,840
genetic diversity I mean and then you

760
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:39,119
have people that are non-cannabis people

761
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,119
in charge of whole

762
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,919
countries I mean that I guess you know

763
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:48,038
there's no risk anymore so it's just a

764
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,720
job at this point right so it is what it

765
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:54,000
is we gotta all kind of live with the

766
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,159
times and do our best to lightly educate

767
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,038
or pass on the knowledge that's

768
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,080
important pass on the understanding that

769
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:02,319
there needs to be some credit given to

770
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,278
the Trailblazers who literally gave up

771
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,720
their freedom in life for us to even be

772
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:08,798
in this position um but that's probably

773
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,558
a Fool's errand honestly yeah that's

774
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,119
what we try to do and it is a Fool's

775
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,079
errand you have to like self flatulation

776
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,558
a lot to be doing that I'm telling you

777
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,678
yeah I think it's the good fight though

778
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,240
man you guys gotta keep it going it's

779
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,559
it's something I think it's just

780
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,720
stubborn

781
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:27,599
essentially good I can respect that too

782
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,759
yeah stubborn and ego is what everybody

783
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,038
say I've got I've got one of those

784
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,759
questions for Pico right now uh since

785
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:35,720
we're kind of in the broader you know

786
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,679
broader Reflections I guess on the

787
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,798
industry uh what are your thoughts on

788
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,519
the modern Gene

789
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:46,398
for um I'm trying to diversify it as

790
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,120
much as possible it's a little

791
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:52,038
depressing because it's not my flavor I

792
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:54,639
guess but in my fickle nature my flavor

793
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:57,519
today is not my flavor tomorrow anyway

794
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,799
um so I don't know I can appreciate I

795
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:04,839
can appreciate the new the new guard of

796
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:06,440
things but um I always just go back to

797
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,038
there's got to be something interesting

798
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,798
and different is interesting you know

799
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:14,359
the same is not interesting and that's

800
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,798
that's where I I lose interest really

801
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,000
quickly and it's the same thing if I go

802
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:21,000
back to my history if I just growing all

803
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,679
OG all the time is extremely boring now

804
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,079
I would [ __ ] kill to have that OG cut

805
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,798
and be growing that just for my own

806
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,599
personal smoke even because it was

807
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,519
[ __ ] killing and I loved it and I

808
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,839
still love it and I don't have it

809
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,278
anymore but I talk about that the last

810
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,678
several episodes I get hit up daily by

811
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:39,278
other breeders like hey did you keep any

812
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,399
OG Cuts Like It's it happened yeah yeah

813
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,119
and I've got so many now in the stable

814
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,759
but none of them are hitting the button

815
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,398
the way I want and and honestly some of

816
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,240
what we're doing in the indoor grow I

817
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:51,639
think has taken away from that flavor

818
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,880
profile like being as true as it is I'm

819
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,960
sure the vroid and you know those sorts

820
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,120
of things are playing a role in a lot of

821
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,720
this and just general pathogen um in the

822
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:04,558
modern gene pool so what what I'm trying

823
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,038
to do with our with our operation is

824
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,000
really establish a clean plant program

825
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,798
um which is mostly starting from seed

826
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,839
you know and not

827
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,079
intermingling those with cuts that might

828
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,319
come in from whoever or wherever

829
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,798
absolutely and and for me that's the

830
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,439
only way out from the virid or from

831
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:26,158
other pathogen issues is just to start

832
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,840
from seed keep really clean plants and

833
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,360
um and always have something you and and

834
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,079
that really serves our purposes of at

835
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,398
the end of the day what we're trying to

836
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,839
do is sell weed too and having unique

837
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,639
things in the market is always going to

838
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,319
help because at the end of the day we

839
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,399
are competing against everyone that has

840
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,278
the same list of clones essentially and

841
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,759
um you know it just becomes milk toast

842
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:45,398
and then what you have is buyers that

843
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,558
are just Price shopping because it's all

844
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:49,000
the same so oh yeah if it's got the name

845
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:50,639
and nobody can see it or smell it before

846
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,038
they smoke it anyway then they're just

847
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,519
Price shopping for who's gonna who's

848
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:54,919
about to go out of business who's going

849
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,278
to give me the cheapest price to

850
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,278
liquidate their you know absolutely

851
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,038
Lemon Cherry gelato rents or whatever

852
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,599
the [ __ ] it is so it's a little I mean

853
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,638
as much as I say that I still see so

854
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,079
many people doing good work so many

855
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:11,038
people putting out new interesting

856
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,278
things and so many people continuing to

857
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,679
try to diversify the gene pool and try

858
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,200
to do what I would consider the right

859
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,240
thing for the plant and being good

860
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,639
stewards of the plant um you know by

861
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,599
just continuing their own path and

862
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:28,319
making and marching forward you know

863
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:29,839
endlessly so it's it's I think I maybe

864
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,200
it's better than it used to be I don't

865
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:36,000
know it's hard to say man there's like

866
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,840
there's more good weed today than I

867
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,519
think there has been in the past but

868
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,199
that's also why the price is dropping

869
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,200
down to nothing because there's

870
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,159
everybody's growing it I mean what

871
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,360
legality really did was it just took

872
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,600
away the threshold of risk for anyone

873
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,240
and and so even people who are doing it

874
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:56,319
you know in the Rainbow Market or

875
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,558
whatever the risk is a thousand times

876
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:02,000
lower I mean so County for instance they

877
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:04,798
if we were completely illegal last year

878
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,038
doing things totally illegal had no lure

879
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,720
whatsoever it's like $100,000 a day fine

880
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:12,158
and if you were close enough if you were

881
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,759
close like you have 10 [ __ ] acres and

882
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,960
if you were close enough to your Harvest

883
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,599
window and you got like a multi-million

884
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,399
dollar crop then that's [ __ ] worth it

885
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,678
but if you're if you were licensed and

886
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:26,038
legal you were facing uh I think we had

887
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,919
at one point we were facing 4X in fine

888
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:32,839
so we had 4 and something thousand in

889
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,799
fines pending for um because we had an

890
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:36,599
emergency situation and had a storm and

891
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,558
we had to harvest early and throw it in

892
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,278
a building that we had we ended up

893
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,038
amassing hundreds of thousands of

894
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:44,440
dollars of fines just because that

895
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:46,679
building wasn't properly license oh my

896
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,360
God all of the weed was accounted for

897
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,880
all of the metric tags were there all

898
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,678
the weights were there everything was

899
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,960
done to show that there was no like

900
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,399
Divergent of this crop but you we could

901
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,840
have done it illegally and made way more

902
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,119
money and never never had to pay any of

903
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,439
the [ __ ] taxes or do anything so it's

904
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,439
just like I don't know it's it's really

905
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,000
like open this market up into an

906
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,320
interesting way where no one has to risk

907
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,880
it to you know to get gain out of it and

908
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:12,638
um that's [ __ ] everything up even

909
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,519
worse than the genan pool thing I think

910
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:18,319
the the players of today are the real

911
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,319
stain on our industry when I talk to

912
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,678
people about legality like you know

913
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,000
there a lot of people that aren't big in

914
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,360
the Cannabis world like my family

915
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,599
members they're talking to me about it

916
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,479
and I try to explain it to them and in

917
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:31,918
the way I explained it is it became more

918
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,360
legal for rich people to grow and more

919
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,679
safe for rich people to grow I don't

920
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:40,119
think there were a lot of advantages

921
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:42,320
necessarily to the smaller Growers

922
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,719
though I don't think any big Advantage

923
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,960
came for the home

924
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,759
grower personally maybe less maybe less

925
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,480
fear at night sleeping which is a big it

926
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,759
is a big thing in that sense but you

927
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,278
also have less fear because you're

928
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,079
getting pushed out of the business and

929
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:01,119
you need a new hustle anyways you know

930
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,759
that's the way I look at it for sure um

931
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,959
yeah any other broad Reflections on the

932
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:06,599
industry I mean you kind of did touch on

933
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,240
white labeling a little bit or an

934
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:10,759
implication maybe did you want to talk

935
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,719
to that uh more

936
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,520
explicitly yeah I mean I'm opening I'm

937
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,799
I'm open to talking about it I mean it's

938
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,599
something that you know we've discussed

939
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,560
as I think somewhat of a necessary thing

940
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,200
depending upon what an outfit's needs

941
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,559
are and how they're trying to grow their

942
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,199
business and what their business model

943
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:30,519
looks like um I've done white labeling

944
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,598
for other brands um I don't have any

945
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,079
issue with it it was still something

946
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,359
there's two sides to it I think the

947
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,320
Viewpoint is that oh you're not doing

948
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,559
your own work um you know you're a bad

949
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,399
breeder or whatever but the reality is

950
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:44,039
that it also opens up a lot of time for

951
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,838
those individuals to work on other

952
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,878
efforts that are going to continue their

953
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:51,279
business along and not be bogged down by

954
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,279
the um you know actual production of the

955
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,960
seed part of it so it'd be like the same

956
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,400
thing as hiring someone to run your grow

957
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,358
in my opinion yeah it's you know you're

958
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,838
going to hire someone to come take

959
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:01,598
clones for you it's not going to affect

960
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,639
the overall outcome they're still doing

961
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,359
all the direction they're still telling

962
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,920
me what they want how they want it

963
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,519
they're giving me Plants you know nine

964
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,639
times out of 10 to do the breeding work

965
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,880
that they want and you know I have skill

966
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,159
and Will Travel I'm happy to help and

967
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,358
and that's what a lot of the that's what

968
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,598
the bank was about you know what I mean

969
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:22,319
the bank was about essentially helping

970
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,559
and aiding and it was about selling

971
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,400
seeds also so if that was the platform

972
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,960
in order to sell seeds and it went

973
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,838
through a white leling thing happy to do

974
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,880
it I think we see a lot of extractors

975
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,639
the same stuff you know they kind of

976
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,559
work for I mean it it has become really

977
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,199
really difficult and expensive to sort

978
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,880
of build a brand and get out there and

979
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,439
start something new now because I'm I'm

980
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,920
going through it I mean my you know I've

981
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,960
been working for a long time but I

982
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,280
haven't really self-promoted I'm not

983
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,720
good at Instagram I'm not a marketing

984
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,000
guy um by any means I try to do good by

985
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:58,399
that stuff but you know the um Mass

986
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,960
Appeal had has evaded me I think in a

987
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,160
lot of ways and a lot of my work is more

988
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,480
real than it is fluff you know it's

989
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:08,239
actual like good strong plants that are

990
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,079
genetics that will yield for you and

991
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,879
produce time and time again have great

992
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,400
Vigor and you know it's not just about

993
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,318
taking a picture it's more about serving

994
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,599
the broader Market I think a lot of the

995
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:21,239
hype [ __ ] is serving a very very small

996
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,559
amount of the market um in my state it's

997
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:27,639
probably 3% three or 4% of the consumer

998
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,318
who actually cares about like finding

999
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,480
that hype strain or finding that one in

1000
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:33,079
a million or paying you know 80 bucks an

1001
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,199
eth it's like a tiny amount of the

1002
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,240
market you know what I mean so for what

1003
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,078
we're doing it's like we got to sell a

1004
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:41,759
lot of weed and and in order to do that

1005
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:45,160
I need to have a broad scope of things

1006
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,520
that are available um for everybody so I

1007
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,440
I went off on a tangent I forget where I

1008
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,440
started with that with the white

1009
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,920
labeling thing but yeah it's I mean it's

1010
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,358
a part of the market um you know it's

1011
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,720
what happens in Europe to everyone it's

1012
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:58,559
been happening for a long time and a lot

1013
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,439
don't realize that like yeah if you want

1014
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,199
to do

1015
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,480
business there are brokerages which will

1016
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:06,159
take your plants make as many seeds as

1017
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,440
you want for you they will package it

1018
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,719
for you they will do all the leg work

1019
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,280
they will do all the shipping they will

1020
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,719
do everything and they'll pay you a

1021
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,359
percentage back and that's the white

1022
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:15,838
labeling you know my white labeling was

1023
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:18,799
a little different I would basically

1024
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,279
create and then offload to whomever and

1025
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,200
they could do their own everything with

1026
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,359
it after that and just provide good

1027
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,199
quality seeds you know to them at a

1028
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:29,880
reasonable price and for me you know

1029
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,439
that was still like seeds were worth

1030
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,358
about as much as gold I can sell a pound

1031
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,200
of seeds for like a buck a seed and

1032
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,920
that's going to net me about 30 grand

1033
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,000
you know gold is probably what 28 right

1034
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,559
now I'm not watching the spot price but

1035
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,519
it's like seeds are worth more than gold

1036
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,759
in that terminology so if white labeling

1037
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,838
is the thing that helps to move the

1038
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,560
needle and allows something like the

1039
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:56,838
bank to take hold and be a driver for

1040
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:59,960
the greater good of many then um I see

1041
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:03,960
that as a as a solid move yeah you know

1042
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,318
I I I was I did white labeling for a

1043
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,800
while for others so I don't see like

1044
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:11,480
I've never seen it as like a necess like

1045
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,039
something evil or anything like that

1046
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,358
when I was doing it was for friends and

1047
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,079
I'd fly out do it make it for them I

1048
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,480
knew they were capable of doing it it's

1049
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,119
just they didn't have the time to do it

1050
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,599
you know yeah and that way I knew they

1051
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,200
were also getting a good product and

1052
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,519
something if I would put my name behind

1053
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,879
it then I'm sure they they would be

1054
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:28,759
stoked with it yeah um but it's also

1055
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,960
about dropping your ego really hard

1056
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,319
because sometimes you'll watch what you

1057
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,039
made be taken and put on a platform and

1058
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:38,000
the other people be

1059
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:40,440
like well I've seen that too I mean you

1060
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,358
get there's a I I'm not g to lie that

1061
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,159
there is like a slight what if or

1062
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,639
resentment when you see something that

1063
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,118
even if you sell it for a dollar seed

1064
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,598
and it cost you 15 cents to make it you

1065
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,880
know which is a great margin and then

1066
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,200
they take that dollar seed and sell it

1067
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,318
for nine bucks a seed or 25 bucks a seed

1068
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:58,000
which has happened it's like oh I could

1069
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:59,519
have done a little I should Market

1070
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,880
better because I could have made a lot

1071
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:04,159
more money doing this but um at the end

1072
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,960
of the day happy to do the work and you

1073
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,318
know no skin off my teeth in the same

1074
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,720
way and I consider it a partnership more

1075
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:12,358
than just like a you know a thing but in

1076
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:14,358
the same way um you know our outfit down

1077
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:16,279
down in Arizona is um partnered up with

1078
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:18,039
Dr Green Thumb so we're doing all the uh

1079
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,040
grow in the state of Arizona for their

1080
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,239
brand and that's the same thing you know

1081
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,800
we're white labeling they come and check

1082
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,919
up they make sure the quality is on

1083
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,119
point um but we do every aspect of work

1084
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,760
outside of that and uh and try to

1085
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,000
support the relationship and support the

1086
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,319
brand in the way that they know that we

1087
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,760
will and that's why we're partnered up

1088
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:38,358
in the first place um so in the same way

1089
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,839
I think any sort of white labeling is

1090
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:43,159
still serving a great purpose and um and

1091
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,400
if you come at it with an honorable

1092
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,239
place and integrity and and the mission

1093
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,599
for both sides is really good

1094
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:50,919
stewardship of the plant and moving the

1095
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,920
thing forward then I think it's it's all

1096
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,200
good and and I'm I'm happy I got a

1097
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,119
family to take care of I'm happy to have

1098
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:58,480
a job in the industry you know what I

1099
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,680
mean and pay my bills like last year I

1100
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,199
was on the precipice of taking a job

1101
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:05,519
totally outside of cannabis which would

1102
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:07,118
have been the first time since out 20

1103
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,679
plus years that I would have been doing

1104
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,358
something outside of cannabis and was

1105
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,118
really seriously looking at that I went

1106
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,799
to the emerald Cup last year and was

1107
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,880
like severely depressed at just the

1108
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,640
downturn The Fallout there was so few

1109
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,400
people there the I mean the sizes of the

1110
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,838
booths had gone from like people had six

1111
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,559
booths next to each other and they were

1112
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:30,279
squished in and sharing one amongst like

1113
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,799
four other companies all of a sudden and

1114
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,200
it was like oh my God what happened to

1115
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,359
my industry so I was like a fingernail

1116
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,559
away from taking a job that was all the

1117
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:44,318
way outside of the industry and hanging

1118
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:46,000
it up and um really glad that I didn't

1119
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,239
because I was just saying it's more

1120
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,119
interesting to be in it and again I

1121
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:52,239
learn every day so it's it's I believe

1122
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:55,519
it's my life's purpose I believe I was

1123
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,719
I'm here to do this um as silly as that

1124
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,199
may sound to some really feel like you

1125
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,679
know I've dedicated my life to it up to

1126
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,719
this point I want to continue on that

1127
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:04,598
mission and um even to get to that point

1128
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,239
was was kind of sad as far as the state

1129
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,760
of the industry goes it's I mean that's

1130
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:11,799
passion right that's what you're

1131
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,640
explaining is Passion um and there is a

1132
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,000
reality too to the economic side of

1133
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:18,879
white labeling right like yeah it costs

1134
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,480
x amount if you have a smaller op to

1135
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,880
make seeds it's obviously going to cost

1136
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,199
more the smaller you're op to make seeds

1137
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,599
and in reality a lot of these and why

1138
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,519
this whole thing even started in Spain

1139
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,880
and and the Dutch went there was because

1140
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,519
of legal laws legal loopholes kind of

1141
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,480
set it up and over time people realized

1142
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,960
oh it's actually cheaper to buy the

1143
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,719
seeds repackage them and to make them

1144
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,960
ourselves get Ri all the risk that comes

1145
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:46,199
with that and there's a a whole economic

1146
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,559
side to it that really drove the market

1147
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,919
that way I think and almost made it a

1148
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,679
necessary part of it for a lot of you're

1149
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,559
absolutely right yeah and that and

1150
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,440
that's why that's why the idea of the

1151
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:00,358
bank was more of a conduit to allow

1152
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,240
people here I mean I I think that at one

1153
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:03,799
point with the bank with what we were

1154
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,479
doing and how many seeds we were not

1155
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,318
only creating but also um testing and

1156
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,800
growing that I think we were probably

1157
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:13,599
one of the biggest seed producers in

1158
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,280
North America if not if not entirely we

1159
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,240
were there was a lot of work happening

1160
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,079
and it was it was awesome to be a part

1161
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,759
of that and hopefully we can revisit

1162
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,760
that at a later

1163
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:27,919
date uh is that Matt lagging out a

1164
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,680
little bit yeah there was a little Li

1165
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,440
you're you're good though I'm good okay

1166
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:35,480
Matt I don't know if when you're back

1167
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:41,079
that's one minut 1 hour

1168
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:43,159
37 40 we'll say roughly got it got it

1169
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,519
okay um I wanted to offer a kind of

1170
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,480
paraphrase for this white labeling topic

1171
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,280
like kind like both of you are saying

1172
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,079
there's nothing inherently bad about

1173
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,040
white labeling like with any industry it

1174
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:58,039
comes with scale at a certain point um I

1175
00:42:54,039 --> 00:43:01,079
suppose what's important here is between

1176
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:03,279
the uh you know for the customer it's

1177
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,800
about how these products are being

1178
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,400
framed I guess and then between the

1179
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,160
producer and the seller it's about

1180
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,440
Symmetry and some kind of fairness um

1181
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:14,239
and if those conditions are in place

1182
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,760
then white labeling is totally fine but

1183
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,479
sometimes those are not as long as

1184
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,520
you're paying as long as you're paying

1185
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,559
for something and getting what you're

1186
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,599
told you're being PID you're paying for

1187
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,599
like this genetic says this and that it

1188
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,960
shouldn't be an issue to me that's

1189
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,240
that's the way it should go you know

1190
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,679
like I haven't ever done it yet you know

1191
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,118
but I'm not saying I wouldn't do it

1192
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:37,159
because like the Market's crashed the

1193
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:39,358
Market's absolutely crashed and and I

1194
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:41,159
don't always make fem seeds anymore you

1195
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,880
know and there's an absolute demand for

1196
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:47,000
it but it's just one of those things you

1197
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,640
have to be able to present it with what

1198
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
it is like these genetics are what we

1199
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:54,118
say they are and transparency is key in

1200
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,920
that and not everybody does it that way

1201
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,680
but it's not necessarily on the onus of

1202
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,280
the people making the seeds to force

1203
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:04,399
other people to behave at the same time

1204
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,680
yeah the key's been relationships yeah

1205
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,200
absolutely 100% like they know they can

1206
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:11,279
trust me to not only do a great job and

1207
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:14,519
carry it out keep up communication

1208
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,839
ensure that what I'm saying it is it is

1209
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:20,679
um you know but also help to serve their

1210
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,480
greater needs whatever those may be and

1211
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:26,118
and vice versa and they're giving me you

1212
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,838
know an opportunity work and happy to do

1213
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:30,119
the work you know so at the end of the

1214
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:32,239
day that's what it kind of comes down to

1215
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,000
for me so yeah no there shouldn't be an

1216
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,959
issue I don't think I think it's awesome

1217
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,199
that you get to go through these

1218
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,639
populations of all these different

1219
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:38,879
things that's the only thing I when I

1220
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:40,519
think about this [ __ ] like that's the

1221
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,318
first thing I think about populations

1222
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:47,079
getting to see all these data points

1223
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:49,519
like oh best man I mean yeah population

1224
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:51,519
equals speed if you want to get the get

1225
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,559
to the best fast the bigger the

1226
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,199
population you can you can run the

1227
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:56,680
easier it's going to be to find doesn't

1228
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,679
mean you can't find great stuff out of

1229
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:01,639
10 seed pops or two seed pops or 20 or

1230
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:04,000
whatever I mean I've I've done it always

1231
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:06,159
way under the sun and I generally I

1232
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,119
always find something I like and find a

1233
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,318
keeper you know even if it's just

1234
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:13,119
compared against those comps that are in

1235
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:16,279
that group um but when I've done them in

1236
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,160
numbers of thousands um it becomes

1237
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,880
really apparent who the winners are for

1238
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:22,558
sure and at least if you're looking at

1239
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,880
it from a phenotypic range like some of

1240
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,000
it was some of it was growing a huge

1241
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,800
amount just to get the data to know that

1242
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,119
if we want to do a real hunt you know

1243
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,519
absolutely we know what we're looking

1244
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,160
now I can a reconnaissance

1245
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:39,079
reconnaissance pop yeah exactly I can be

1246
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:42,759
a sniper with my Approach rather than

1247
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:42,760
take a very shotg guny approach to

1248
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:53,440
it this has been a really cool and yeah

1249
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:56,239
very very um Rich conversation um we're

1250
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,200
probably nearing the end a bit um mat

1251
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:01,318
what were you say you said Rico that I

1252
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:04,078
was gonna see Rico swap in of M just

1253
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:05,679
ignore that um I was gonna ask people

1254
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,240
like what's what's coming up next you

1255
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:12,719
know what's happening over this next

1256
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:14,479
year um well so I'm doing um I'm H

1257
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,558
helping out a lot more with the actual

1258
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,358
marketing for this company so I'm GNA be

1259
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,880
um actually dropping off some stuff and

1260
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:23,480
doing all of my work is going to be

1261
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,000
dropping through the company I'm working

1262
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,079
for now which is the flower shop in

1263
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,719
Arizona so they have three retail

1264
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,599
locations in Phoenix I go to those the

1265
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:33,919
first Tuesday of every month and I'm in

1266
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,480
the store kind of debuting the new

1267
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,599
selections that we're doing and we're

1268
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,880
offering those as like shop drops that's

1269
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,359
so cool yeah so that's that's a really

1270
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,599
cool thing I'm trying to build that up

1271
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,838
and develop it more obviously I'm not

1272
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,519
known there um they don't know my work

1273
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,239
from anybody else's and don't have like

1274
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,838
a name but trying to do it really in a

1275
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,838
Grassroots way where I can connect with

1276
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:55,799
the retail consumer give my Spiel and

1277
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,480
also connect our cultivation facility

1278
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,519
with our retail locations that's always

1279
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,639
been a key for me in in just the sales

1280
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,119
in the legal Market is really being able

1281
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:05,920
to connect what we're trying to do in

1282
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,838
our ethos as cultivators with how it's

1283
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,159
being sold and presented on the retail

1284
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,799
level so um I'll be doing that next

1285
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:14,318
Tuesday actually because the new year we

1286
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,039
fell off and every Tuesday after that

1287
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,159
and with my feno hunts that I'm doing at

1288
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,039
the facility and when we find cool [ __ ]

1289
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:22,318
that's when we we debut it in the shop

1290
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,279
drops we pepper it out in really small

1291
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,279
amounts um so that it's going to sell

1292
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,920
out and not be widely available

1293
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,640
and then generally if those strains are

1294
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,039
good enough we'll hit we'll go into like

1295
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:34,000
a more of a production mode with them

1296
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:35,440
and not only produce for our brand but

1297
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,199
the other brands that we grow for as

1298
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,519
well so that's going to be happening I

1299
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:42,480
am doing more work on in the vein of the

1300
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:45,079
seed Hub trying to make more of those

1301
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,760
connections and bring more folks down to

1302
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:49,000
this facility to do the same kind of

1303
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,440
thing um as I said earlier in the

1304
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,480
conversation it's something I'm really

1305
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,039
like tiptoeing into everything I've done

1306
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,760
has been fairly calculated as far as

1307
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:59,039
like Risk goes and and with um having to

1308
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,720
serve a company outside of just myself

1309
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,400
and my own interests you know I need to

1310
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,279
prove it and make sure it's working for

1311
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,519
them um as well and so that's where

1312
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,160
we're trying to build like kind of the

1313
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:11,519
first couple relationships that we want

1314
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:13,440
to enter into agreements with and get

1315
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,759
into contract to have the seed

1316
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,760
production done down at our facility do

1317
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,040
the feno Hunts down there and then

1318
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,599
hopefully release the flow at in this

1319
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:24,079
kind of like shop drop model that I'm

1320
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,599
trying to build up now so that's been a

1321
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,480
lot of my focus um

1322
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:31,039
and just continuing to not only make

1323
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,000
seed and Hunt seed constantly and just

1324
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,358
learn just learn more about the plant as

1325
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,880
much as possible the the challenges that

1326
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,759
I have now is really more about

1327
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,680
management of people which um has been a

1328
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,480
real challenge you know we have 75

1329
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,598
employees down at the spot I'm at so

1330
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,079
yeah so just just that alone is a is a

1331
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:51,760
new challenge that I'm really trying to

1332
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,720
take on and um and with that I'm I'm

1333
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,160
trying to also there was a guy I was

1334
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:57,558
working with before who sadly isn't with

1335
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:58,838
us anymore his name was James um he

1336
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,519
didn't die or anything he just went to a

1337
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:03,400
different job I was like oh rest in

1338
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:05,358
peace sounded really dire no no no he

1339
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,318
went to a different job but but what he

1340
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,679
had set up at the facility I'm at now

1341
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,159
was basically a leadership program for

1342
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,598
some of the younger folks who are coming

1343
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:14,679
up into the industry for the first time

1344
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:17,440
and having their first jobs and kind of

1345
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:19,440
teaching them on not only how to behave

1346
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,798
um not behave but you know how you can

1347
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,880
be a great leader and a great motivator

1348
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:25,639
um and and really build the passion that

1349
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,798
we have for this plant into some of the

1350
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:29,358
other people who are just stepping into

1351
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:31,039
these roles for the first time um but

1352
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,078
just how to be a great leader even if

1353
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,239
you're going to be outside of this

1354
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,400
industry and continue on so that's

1355
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,919
that's a program that I'm actually

1356
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,400
focusing quite a bit of attention on

1357
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,559
right now um it's a it's a new challenge

1358
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,318
and it's kind of outside of the industry

1359
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,079
while or outside of the plant while

1360
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:48,119
still being you know very important in

1361
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:51,680
the industry um so that's a big focus

1362
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:53,838
and then um I'm really trying to do more

1363
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:56,039
education for the retail and Bud tender

1364
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,679
consumer not only about things like the

1365
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:59,400
provenance of plants the importance of

1366
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,078
lineage the importance of credit being

1367
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:05,160
given to those who came before us um but

1368
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:08,240
also more education around chemotypes

1369
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:12,000
Plant profiles the tpine specifically um

1370
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:14,959
I use crybaby's um scent kit as a great

1371
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,798
tool for Education around really

1372
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,199
debunking what has become a problem as

1373
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:22,798
far as the word Tarpin are used or turs

1374
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:24,639
are used in our industry today and and

1375
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:26,759
trying to you know the banana is a great

1376
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,838
example so having a banana strain where

1377
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,480
I can show them a tpine profile I can

1378
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:33,519
show them each individual TP and you can

1379
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,880
smell it and tell me when you see the or

1380
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:36,480
when you smell the banana you know what

1381
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,880
I mean and then I can bring out the

1382
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,480
Esters that he has also in the kit and

1383
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,318
really show them these other things are

1384
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,079
also responsible for the things that we

1385
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:48,239
smell taste and just love about the plan

1386
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,920
um so more more education is has always

1387
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,919
been the move and I'll continue that

1388
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,720
this year and then you know I really

1389
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,880
want to um I just want to continue the

1390
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,399
to develop better relationships with my

1391
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,160
community members and folks in the

1392
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,639
industry and I think too often you know

1393
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,078
we get really chippy and that's

1394
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,159
something we were talking about earlier

1395
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,400
I think before we started about there's

1396
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:11,000
a competitive nature to the breeders in

1397
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,039
general and um and that's normal because

1398
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,318
we're it this is capitalism you know

1399
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,798
we're all kind of fighting for the same

1400
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:18,119
share but the thing that always brought

1401
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:19,960
me to cannabis in the first place the

1402
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:21,400
thing I loved about it even more so than

1403
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,119
the effect that I always enjoyed and

1404
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,559
smoking and everything else was the

1405
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,240
camaraderie and the fact that if I was

1406
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,440
at a random place as like a teenager and

1407
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:30,078
found another person who wanted to go

1408
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,760
outside and and get high it was like

1409
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,960
instant friend you know just like it is

1410
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,160
with the music the same [ __ ] as me and

1411
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,559
and that really if I boil everything

1412
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:40,879
about the plant down and the community

1413
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:42,119
or the you know the quote unquote

1414
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,480
community that we always talk about

1415
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:45,880
that's what it's about it's about

1416
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,039
sharing when I do something great when I

1417
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,119
create like something amazing that I'm

1418
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:51,679
proud of I want to share it it's not

1419
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:54,160
something that I can keep to myself

1420
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,078
because my pride of ownership over what

1421
00:51:54,159 --> 00:52:00,039
I've done is really only understood when

1422
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:01,160
it's shared and so absolutely I don't

1423
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:03,599
know just continuing with that and

1424
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:05,679
trying to be like a better overall

1425
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,880
person and Community member in 2024 now

1426
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:09,159
that we're at the beginning of the year

1427
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,079
you know I'm getting sappy with it yeah

1428
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:13,838
you're old New Year's resolution I love

1429
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:15,559
it yeah I'm also I'm also in dry January

1430
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:18,279
so that's my resolution the rest of it

1431
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:20,359
is like betterment for myself and trying

1432
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,079
to be in a growth mindset always you

1433
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:24,358
know to just continue to develop not

1434
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,160
only the plant and our methodologies and

1435
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:28,598
our operations but also myself as a

1436
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,078
person as a leader as a um person who

1437
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:32,280
deals with cannabis and being a good

1438
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,559
representative for you know for the

1439
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,119
plant absolutely it's really cool you

1440
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:39,160
know I think both you and Matt Shar that

1441
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,960
a lot that kind of community oriented

1442
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:44,440
spirit and I think you know it makes

1443
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,000
sense like people are what make things

1444
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,119
meaningful

1445
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,079
um you if you die alone in your cave

1446
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,559
with your special project it's like you

1447
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:56,559
know I don't know it's not the same yeah

1448
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,760
yeah well well so that's something I

1449
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,240
shared with with our with our facility

1450
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,599
recently it was really interesting so we

1451
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:03,479
you look at like the serving size of

1452
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,480
cannabis call it an eth right that's

1453
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,280
what we always bought butes um so I was

1454
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,639
just doing like the math on how much

1455
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,839
like material we put out in the last

1456
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,279
month or I think it was the month of

1457
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:16,078
November and how many if we just take

1458
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,680
that a total amount of material you know

1459
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,680
get rid of extracts and all the other

1460
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,279
[ __ ] and trim whatever else but we just

1461
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,719
look at like our serving sample size is

1462
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:28,519
an eighth like the the facility that I'm

1463
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:31,959
running we put out 250,000 e in the so

1464
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:34,440
it's like we potentially touch 250,000

1465
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,720
people with our work you know absolutely

1466
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:40,720
to me like the revelation of that is so

1467
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:42,679
meaningful and so important that I have

1468
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:45,480
to serve this thing with my best

1469
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:47,239
intentions and U and make sure that the

1470
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,079
experience that they're having because

1471
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:51,798
of my efforts and work um is as good as

1472
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,760
it possibly can be and that I would put

1473
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:56,440
my stamp on it and stand behind it and

1474
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,640
smoke it with them you know so I think

1475
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,119
that that's an important um an important

1476
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,480
Point as well is just how many people we

1477
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,400
can touch with this thing and I happen

1478
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,960
to be in a very large facility so it's a

1479
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,760
lot and just to bring that back home for

1480
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,119
everybody else that works with us just

1481
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,640
like you know that that's a shared

1482
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,680
experience like our efforts every day

1483
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,000
for grueling at work is like it's a

1484
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:19,960
shared experience that what we're

1485
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,239
creating is something special it's

1486
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,119
something someone's going to get benefit

1487
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:24,679
out of and what a great way to spend

1488
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,440
work you know doing something that's

1489
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:30,000
also good doing it's beneficial to

1490
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,000
humanity for sure yeah one of my quotes

1491
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,559
that I've lived by recently or in the

1492
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,880
last 10 years or so is just do good and

1493
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,960
by doing well do well by doing good

1494
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,480
that's it so it's like I want to have

1495
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,199
both the moral good and the I'm doing

1496
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,280
good too um you know aspect to

1497
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:48,919
everything I do so I just try to keep

1498
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,720
those kind of you know North Stars in

1499
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,960
mind when making any decisions or just

1500
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:54,838
going through the day-to-day because it

1501
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,480
can get mundane and it can get you can

1502
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,920
get batter down you can get Negative

1503
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,400
really easily um so to stay positive I

1504
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,159
just focus on that stuff and remember

1505
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,720
that I could be shoveling roadkill off

1506
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:07,759

1507
