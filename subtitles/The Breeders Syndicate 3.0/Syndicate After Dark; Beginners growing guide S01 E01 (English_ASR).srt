links below to the breeder Syndicate

13
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,519
codex it's an awesome strain database

14
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:40,039
that's worth checking out yeah so it's

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,760
really interesting like the other day

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,679
quasia did this survey and we kind of

17
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,640
got this um idea that like you know a

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,039
big portion of people in The Syndicate

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,558
may be new

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,719
Growers and uh you know

21
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:56,759
so um I I think it'd be pretty cool to

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,439
just talk about some like really basic

23
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,759
new stuff that maybe we don't touch on

24
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,599
in the show sometimes you know what I

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,280
mean

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,599
yeah yeah I think that's a a good point

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,239
I mean I know that Matt um doesn't

28
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,359
really like talking about growing stuff

29
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:14,280
too much and so maybe that is a good

30
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,719
point um uh I think that um you know um

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,599
we can kind of just talk about from our

32
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,400
own perspectives because I mean at the

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,158
end of the day we're basically amateurs

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,799
and new ourselves at least I would

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,799
consider myself relatively yeah for sure

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,720
yeah definitely still very new yeah and

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,880
like the the hurdles are still very

38
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,599
fresh in my mind the problems that we

39
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,959
ran into so I think this is a really

40
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,359
good time to talk about it you know yeah

41
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,639
for sure um I think we could just kind

42
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:43,280
of start off with uh you know the basic

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,359
uh needs of a new grower or somebody

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,879
maybe getting into the the I don't

45
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,478
really like to call it a hobby but for

46
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,920
the sake of it's definitely a hobby I

47
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,718
would definitely say it's a hobby for me

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,359
it's a hobby you know it's uh yeah I me

49
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:00,599
and actually me and D Denali he's

50
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,319
actually another member of reader

51
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,718
Syndicate and we were talking about um

52
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,798
how it's like we call it a lifestyle you

53
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,758
know because especially some like for

54
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,319
sure especially someone like him that's

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,598
been doing it for so long it's kind of I

56
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,878
don't know what I don't think he knows

57
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,878
anything else you know so yeah but um

58
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,840
but maybe go ahead oh go ahead no go

59
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,560
ahead brother yeah so I was just gonna

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,280
say kind of thinking about starting to

61
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,120
grow um in my mind like the first thing

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,719
before I would even think about any

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,480
plants or anything I would just be

64
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,239
thinking about where am I going to grow

65
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:39,079
yeah um Y and that's and you know I

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,319
think like it's really um important to

67
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,879
think about that uh not just where

68
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,679
you're going to put your tent for flower

69
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:47,919
but are you going to have a dedicated

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,959
vegge space are you g to have a you know

71
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,158
you need to have a place to dry um and

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,120
if you're gonna if you're going to want

73
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:56,039
to be running like M you know kind of

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,280
like in a Perpetual style like a lot of

75
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:02,439
us do you kind of want some of these

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,799
places to to be like dedicated areas um

77
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,840
so that it's not just an afterthought uh

78
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,799
because you can definitely get through

79
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,400
your entire grow and not have a place to

80
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,840
dry and like you know really ruin a

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,158
harvest um so it's definitely important

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,158
to think about that I think yeah for

83
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,519
sure I think the biggest mistake that a

84
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,639
lot of new Growers make probably at

85
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,400
least what I did and I see what a lot of

86
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,000
you know other people do is I think a

87
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,239
lot of people when you first get into it

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,919
you buy like a 2 by two and like a

89
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,080
little 150 watt you know Mars Hydro or

90
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,719
whatever it is and then you find

91
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,319
yourself pretty quickly realizing like

92
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,359
you just said you need multiple spaces

93
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:46,759
potentially or I think a a another big

94
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,280
thing is you within a few months you

95
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,318
realize you need like a 4x4 at least

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
maybe even two or maybe a 4x4 and a 2 by

97
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,280
two to you know for your mom stuff like

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,760
that so it's like I think the biggest

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,039
mistake for new Growers is is spending

100
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,798
your money in not necessarily in a bad

101
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,759
way but like you're kind of wasting

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,840
money in the sense I think that if you

103
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,479
think you you know obviously there's

104
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,400
certain people that are only going to

105
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,000
have space for a two by two right so but

106
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,079
there are a lot of people I think the

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,879
majority of people that are getting into

108
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,918
it do have like a little bit of leeway

109
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:24,000
or or more room you know to play with

110
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,359
than you know maybe you're s how do you

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,879
say that then you're willing maybe not

112
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,720
willing but you you just kind of

113
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,879
underestimate what you need and stuff

114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,720
you waste money by maybe buying a

115
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,399
smaller light and then you have to turn

116
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,840
around and you know you realize quickly

117
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,560
that if you're trying to get a certain

118
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,879
amount of yields for yourself to

119
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,280
maintain your smoke or your your own

120
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,199
stash or whatever you're you're going to

121
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,478
realize pretty quickly that uh two by

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,240
two and a you know 150 watt little

123
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,719
light's not gonna probably cover it so

124
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,319
yeah yeah I mean I think you're

125
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,960
definitely right I mean obviously

126
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,719
everyone is going to come into this with

127
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,359
in a different place in their life and

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,520
have different budget and different

129
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,000
space requirements and stuff like that

130
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,159
but yeah I mean there definitely is like

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,720
a certain um just basic level that you

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,280
want to have and I think it's important

133
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,880
to kind of be looking at this as

134
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:17,319
something that um you're going to be you

135
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,639
know when you're buying like a light for

136
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,879
instance you're going to be hopefully

137
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,800
using it for a few years even you know

138
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,759
so be looking at it as like a like an

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,160
investment kind of um that's going to

140
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,199
last you for a while because you know

141
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,479
having nice equipment does um you know

142
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,759
nice equipment lasts longer you know

143
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,719
that kind of thing and a lot of times it

144
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,960
just makes it easier to use which makes

145
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,840
it like funner to grow in general you

146
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,519
know yeah yeah it defin I mean it is

147
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,198
definitely an investment uh you know I

148
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,918
think too in a in a to a certain degree

149
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,560
it does take somebody with a little bit

150
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,318
of money to get going uh you don't have

151
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,680
to be rich by any means or you could

152
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,360
just budget really well like for example

153
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,079
in my area there's no way for me to

154
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,479
really get used equipment whereas I've

155
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,079
seen other people that might have you

156
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,719
know hydro stores going out of business

157
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,478
or whatever picking up sweet deals in

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,039
their local area and things like that

159
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,719
whereas like in my whole state uh

160
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,959
there's literally one hydro stores and

161
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,160
honestly like it's cheaper by the time I

162
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,638
drive out there and everything it's

163
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,240
cheaper for me just to go to Amazon or

164
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,038
or wherever you know on the internet and

165
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,319
just order it to my to my house you know

166
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,839
um yeah for sure I mean it's definitely

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,039
important to just kind of look around

168
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,119
and like I know for me like when I got

169
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,519
into it it was really easy to just like

170
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,280
um go for like the technology that was

171
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,839
like being marketed really hard I mean I

172
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,918
definitely fell for a lot of that kind

173
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:42,279
of stuff and spent more money than I

174
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:43,879
needed to you know yeah um I don't I

175
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,198
didn't really F I didn't fall so much

176
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,680
for the tech aspect I've always try to

177
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,319
uh you know I'm a big uh promoter of

178
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,400
like the kiss I don't I don't even ever

179
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,560
say this like the first time I ever

180
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,000
called it this but like to keep it

181
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,800
simple meod basically I Tred to keep my

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,160
inputs really low and stuff like that so

183
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,079
I didn't fall for necessarily like the

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,080
tech traps but what I thought s for was

185
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,159
more like the seed traps you know like

186
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:08,000
Google I thought like you know growing

187
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,639
up in you know our age a lot of stuff we

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
just Google it right so my first

189
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,079
instinct was to Google you know what are

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
some good seed seed banks and I'm not

191
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,439
going to say any of their names on here

192
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,639
but um you know anyone that googles it

193
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,680
quickly realizes you know uh that these

194
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,759
are lik well I wouldn't say you would

195
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,199
realize that they're not necessarily

196
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
scams but just not what you're really

197
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,080
trying to get into or pay for but you

198
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,079
quickly realize that most of the

199
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,758
Google's controlled by like these giant

200
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,680
seed banks or corporations that may that

201
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,680
definitely don't have like your

202
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,759
anybody's best interests but their own

203
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,800
you know for money and stuff so I felt

204
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,439
for that trap the SE trap for a couple

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,639
years but uh yeah um back to yeah oh

206
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,639
yeah I was gonna say just for like the

207
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,519
place you're growing so I think like at

208
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,439
the B at the simplest terms like you're

209
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,639
going to at some point either decide if

210
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,918
you're going to have to be in a tent or

211
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,639
you're going to be in like some kind of

212
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,839
CLA scenario or are you're going to have

213
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,519
like a dedicated room for it right yeah

214
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,719
and so I think those are things that you

215
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,359
need to think about first um and just

216
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,360
kind of think of the area that you have

217
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,080
and just give yourself a little bit of

218
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,199
uh time to plan ahead for what you're G

219
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,719
to have I think yeah that's GNA set

220
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,439
yourself up for the biggest part of your

221
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,400
success and I think like part of that

222
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,598
too going into something else that I

223
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,000
would mention is that you want to think

224
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,000
about like the environment that you're

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,639
going to be growing in you know so right

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,158
OB viously you if you're able to plan

227
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,560
your grow to be somewhere with the

228
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,080
environment's better uh that's that's

229
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,799
just going to give yourself a leg up as

230
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,719
far as controlling it so that's

231
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,000
something to think about too um what do

232
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,399
you think about when I talk about

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,278
environment well I mean for me the first

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,759
thing that comes to mind um is is is my

235
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:54,838
area like dry is there a lot of moisture

236
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,958
in the area because for me in my area

237
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,160
you know especially in the summertime

238
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,399
humidity is is a big problem s for me I

239
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,278
wouldn't say a big problem but is

240
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,120
probably the biggest problem for me um

241
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,278
it it hasn't caused me problems lately

242
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,799
but like you know am I in a basement

243
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,480
where there's a lot of water leaking you

244
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,039
know in my mind that that that's mold

245
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,720
that's and you know I don't deal with

246
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,519
that so maybe I'm wrong and saying that

247
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,440
but in my mind whenever I think of like

248
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,839
a dark cool moist area that maybe at

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
least around here a lot of the basements

250
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:25,839
aren't finished so sometimes you go in

251
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,600
some of these basements around here in

252
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,640
my area and you'll see like mold or just

253
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,720
filth or like you know is it a clean

254
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,199
space is it a dry space and if it isn't

255
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,440
what can I do to you know maybe get my

256
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,800
tents up off the ground or or take

257
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,240
certain precautions or or get it set up

258
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,559
to where it is going to be because let's

259
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,039
you don't want to get into the middle of

260
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,719
a grow and have your lights and your

261
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,838
your plants and especially if you're in

262
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,200
a place where you it might still be

263
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,480
pretty illegal to be doing what you're

264
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,800
doing so you don't you can't really be

265
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,320
moving [ __ ] around or whatever I mean

266
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,919
you want to make sure you're you're

267
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,120
you're starting off in a good spot for I

268
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,278
was so I would definitely say uh air

269
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,078
flow too am I going to be able to get

270
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,200
fresh air into this space uh those are

271
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,278
the main things that come to my mind and

272
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,320
also I think the main thing like for me

273
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:15,200
in the winter time I'm in a cabin so

274
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,600
like my floor is kind of the crawl space

275
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,278
isn't the best so my root zones get

276
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,560
really cold so that's another thought

277
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,399
too is it in the winter time is that is

278
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,199
it going to be good enough uh

279
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,120
environment for that as well so um but

280
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,120
yeah it's kind of my thoughts on it I

281
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,240
mean if and and if is any kind of issues

282
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,839
those are the main things you need to

283
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,079
address if you're really wanting to grow

284
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,079
you know at the end of the day yeah for

285
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,679
sure I completely agree what you're

286
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,679
saying is all right I mean the

287
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,838
environment is super important I mean

288
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,199
temperature obviously is going to be

289
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,560
important humidity is going to be

290
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,440
important um you know I would say that

291
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,599
there are some places that you can start

292
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,120
if you're interested in like numbers you

293
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,360
know because I think like when you're

294
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,480
when you're new having like a number or

295
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,600
like some Metric that you can gauge as

296
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,200
far as like how you're doing is helpful

297
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,720
yeah um so I think maybe you know early

298
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,240
on for me looking at things like a VPD

299
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,480
chart um and kind of going Loosely off

300
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,000
of that and trying to get into those

301
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,000
good ranges you know for each

302
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,360
um uh like life cycle that the plants in

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,919
um yeah so I think things like that are

304
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,560
pretty you know pretty good and there's

305
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,159
a ton of good information out there so

306
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,159
as far as giving like specifics I

307
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,159
wouldn't I don't you know it's it's

308
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:36,278
obviously going to be super dependent on

309
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,240
your environment um but I would just say

310
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,480
um take things like that into account

311
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,200
before you just like get super excited

312
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,480
and throw up a tent and start growing um

313
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,240
you know we've all done that and it you

314
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,278
know you turn out some less than Stellar

315
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,480
stuff sometimes and I think early on

316
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:57,159
it's easy to get discouraged from maybe

317
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,200
growing if you kind of have like some

318
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,919
poor um experiences and just doing stuff

319
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,879
like this will set yourself up to have

320
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,120
like a really good run and you know

321
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,519
it'll be really it yeah I think you know

322
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,039
you'll know if you like it after the

323
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,159
first one or so and you're right I think

324
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:15,838
uh you know the biggest thing I know for

325
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:19,278
me too when I first started really

326
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,560
taking growing seriously again was yeah

327
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,159
you know when you run into those

328
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,919
problems because you are so uh excited

329
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,719
to get that grow the grow going or

330
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,399
whatever you could waste a lot of beans

331
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,839
you could waste a lot of soil you can

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,679
just be like you said discouraged and I

333
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,880
think that's the biggest thing when

334
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,958
especially as we try to get more people

335
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,320
into the hobby or lifestyle whatever you

336
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,198
want to call it I think that's super

337
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,560
important but um a real life example for

338
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:47,198
me right now that I'm facing on a

339
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,838
personal level um so I the way I have my

340
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:53,120
tents set up is they're in different

341
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:56,320
rooms and one of my tents uh my 4x4 is

342
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,480
actually in a room with a dog door so

343
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,199
I'm facing a lot of problems right now

344
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,039
not a lot but some issues with

345
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:05,919
temperature control because you know um

346
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,319
for for starters I made the mistake of

347
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,120
uh watering right before my lights went

348
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,760
off and I've since switched that which

349
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,839
has kind of turned everything around and

350
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,799
also I've I think what I was getting at

351
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,160
with this is just being flexible so for

352
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:21,078
me um in that room I have to have this

353
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:24,039
year for the first time I had to put in

354
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,719
a um like a radiant heater like a little

355
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:27,838
oil radiant heater in there just to kind

356
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,839
of give it a little boost to make sure

357
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,480
that I'm not having swings and and

358
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,480
humidity and stuff because I'm getting I

359
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,399
got a slight a few specs of PM and I've

360
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,278
never seen powdery Mill do ever in my

361
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,480
tents other than when I first started

362
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,399
growing about four years ago when I had

363
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,199
brought some plants inside so that's

364
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,720
just something that I think is important

365
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,479
is just being flexible and you know

366
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,000
before you get going like you said just

367
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,800
make sure you got a heater make sure you

368
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,639
got these things um you know if you're

369
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,399
planning out your grow you can save

370
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,560
yourself a lot of money by finding like

371
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,278
secondhand stuff like heaters or air

372
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,198
conditioners or stuff but can promise

373
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,399
you if you wake up one day and you say I

374
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,599
want to grow you're probably going to

375
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,720
work out like you know in the range of

376
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,240
you know six seven 800 to a thousand

377
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,278
dollars easy just to get a a good little

378
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,399
if not more you know when you're talking

379
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:17,000
about better lights and things and all

380
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,198
this these own things yeah I mean we

381
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,559
it's definitely um there definitely is

382
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,319
some like startup cost you know involved

383
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,719
and it's I just think it's important to

384
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,199
start looking at those things early um

385
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,079
there's so many cool things now like

386
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,919
obviously like I'm super new but like

387
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,159
listening to the older guys talk about

388
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,278
when they started growing it's like you

389
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,278
know they didn't have any of the

390
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:39,958
resources that there are now any of the

391
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,759
Hydra shops that there are now stuff

392
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,439
like that like right I think that right

393
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,199
now is like a really cool time as far as

394
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,320
growing because like there's so much

395
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,198
information available and that kind of

396
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,560
thing and there's products like AC

397
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,000
Infinity who um you know they have these

398
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,439
controllers that are like super

399
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,559
affordable and they'll kind of keep your

400
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,000
uh environment in a really good range in

401
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,479
like a very easy way with very minimal

402
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,958
effort and so it is worth looking at

403
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,519
those things and not kind of like

404
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:15,638
looking at them as bonuses because um in

405
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,720
a lot of ways like your environment is

406
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,440
going to be so much more important than

407
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,079
even like you know what you're feeding

408
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,639
sometimes you know so yeah yeah I mean

409
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,239
yeah I mean airf flow uh is super

410
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,000
important I mean I know there's all

411
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
kinds of ways of doing it and

412
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,480
everybody's got their own way of doing

413
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,399
it I know a lot of people will run like

414
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,120
an intake and an exhaust but I'm

415
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,318
actually fortunate enough that I on all

416
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:45,879
my tents um like a w it's worked so far

417
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:47,679
um I just have um ex exhaust fans so um

418
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,759
that's worked out really great for me in

419
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,278
my environment just it saves of course

420
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,759
it saves uh the bill and a big part of

421
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:57,559
the reason why I choose to do that is

422
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,120
noise so I do run like some AC Infinity

423
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,159
um you know uh exhaust fans and I have

424
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,480
to say I run them because they're the

425
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,078
quietest that I can find for a good

426
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,680
price like every other one I've had is

427
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,799
super loud um and just to kind of put a

428
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,439
point to you know your environment or

429
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,639
your air flow and stuff like that being

430
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,720
key is you know if you I think I think

431
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,680
when it comes to all this man is the

432
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,079
biggest thing is if you run into

433
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,919
problems to not to give up and try to

434
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:26,919
figure stuff out because all this stuff

435
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,278
is going to be flexible on the

436
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,000
individual grower and where you're at I

437
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,958
know when I started growing dude I was

438
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,120
basing a lot of my infro off of guys

439
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,399
that were growing out in the middle of

440
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,440
the desert or out in the middle of

441
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,039
California so I ran into a lot of

442
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
problems so I think the biggest thing is

443
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,639
getting your hands dirty and making

444
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,759
mistakes and then just kind of the big

445
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,720
you know what really changed my growing

446
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,800
uh I guess just making me or making me a

447
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,519
better grower is I was having pH

448
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,958
problems and overwatering when I first

449
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,078
got back into growing a few years back

450
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,518
and my girlfriend was like I was just at

451
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:00,399
the time I was just chopping them dude

452
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,879
if I run into problems in my mind I was

453
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,359
like you know oh it's just a weak plant

454
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,078
so I'm dropping it and she's like you

455
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,359
know you're Pro and we I got to talking

456
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,119
to her and she's like it's probably just

457
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,678
something that you're doing wrong and

458
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,798
I'm like you know you're right and I I

459
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,679
just spent like a month or two just

460
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,599
researching like issues and trying

461
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,839
instead of just cutting a plant down I

462
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,719
would try to put it through everything

463
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:27,480
so you know and try uh nutrients cow mag

464
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,440
you know worked on my watering uh things

465
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,599
like that you know

466
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,080
so to finish up my point I kind of got

467
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,279
off on tangent there but yeah airf flow

468
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,960
is super important so you're going to

469
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,160
need you a fan or two inside the tent

470
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,038
moving around you're gonna need you at

471
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
least an exhaust and some people are

472
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:44,879
going to need intakes as well you know I

473
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,038
mean depending on what your lights yeah

474
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,520
just you know yeah the biggest thing is

475
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,119
to to find your environment like see

476
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,240
where where you're at measure it you

477
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:57,798
know get a good idea and then figure out

478
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,000
what you need to do to uh get into the

479
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,679
range that

480
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,798
you know that you find on like a VPD

481
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,320
chart or something like that you know

482
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,440
just to give yourself a good idea I'm

483
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,720
not saying to stick directly to those

484
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,440
charts and that they're the end all be

485
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,038
all um but you you know they are um

486
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,360
established metrics for a reason kind of

487
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,079
you know yeah 100% do we have anything

488
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,199
else to really kind of talk about your

489
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,879
environment I mean I think maybe Pest

490
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,080
Control a little bit we could kind of I

491
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,520
think something as a new beginner to uh

492
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,480
maybe just to go ahead pick up is some

493
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,038
just some like little sticky traps or

494
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,480
some fly traps um do you have anything

495
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:39,839
else that you could uh think of I like

496
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,519
not really I I think there are a million

497
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,959
topics as far as IPM goes and there are

498
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,000
a lot other people that are better

499
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,759
qualified to talk about it than me if

500
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,400
you guys have pests um that you know

501
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:53,400
come to the breeder Syndicate uh Discord

502
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,720
there are a ton of smart people and they

503
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,440
will help you with your pets problem but

504
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,919
I am not the one to do it I'm sorry yeah

505
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,360
guess for me I only speak about the

506
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,038
sticky traps because generally the only

507
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:08,479
problems I really have is maybe um a few

508
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,599
uh gats or flies or whatever fruit flies

509
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,159
whatever you call them fungus flies um

510
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,719
and that's really about it so like as

511
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,880
far as I kind of almost like what you

512
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,960
saying I I'm not really an expert on

513
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,400
pest control or management so definitely

514
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,880
join the breeder Syndicate patreon and

515
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,679
join the Discord and those guys over

516
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,159
there will help you out and yeah

517
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,840
seriously it sounds like we're just like

518
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,640
plugging it but like in a very real way

519
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,480
there are super knowledgeable people

520
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,120
that can really help you with those kind

521
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,759
of things um but yeah so the next thing

522
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,558
I would think we we you know we talked

523
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:43,000
about you have your location you have

524
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:47,879
your environment y um now you're GNA

525
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,640
need a light right yeah I mean um and so

526
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,880
like the basic most basic thing that I

527
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,799
think about when you think about

528
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,400
lighting is light cycles for the plants

529
00:19:53,798 --> 00:20:01,480
right so um you are going to want to

530
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,320
know you know know like that you're um

531
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,360
uh like in a veg situation you want to

532
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:09,439
be running say 18 hours of light 6 hours

533
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,918
of Darkness for flower say 12 hours of

534
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,440
light 12 hours of Darkness you know

535
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,038
these are just basic guidelines there's

536
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,720
definitely some tweaks that you can do

537
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:19,960
yeah to fit your needs and obviously you

538
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,679
know like as you grow in uh to this

539
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,679
Hobby and kind of learn the plants and

540
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,960
stuff you'll know more what you need you

541
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,720
know what those needs are yeah I think

542
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,079
it's kind of ties into what we were

543
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,480
talking about earlier with just your

544
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,359
environment in a in a little bit because

545
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,159
you know if you're going to be growing

546
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,399
traditional plants uh you know and

547
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,240
you're not going to be touching Auto

548
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,440
flowers or growing any autof flowers

549
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,679
you're going to probably want to have

550
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,038
two tents you don't have to you could

551
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,720
simply veg to a certain point uh V your

552
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:50,679
plants to a certain size whatever that

553
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,880
may be um and then flip the flower you

554
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,559
know a 1212 light cycle you could run

555
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,200
them during veg you could run them for I

556
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,960
actually run I'll be honest like a lot

557
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,558
of most of the stuff I run

558
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,720
um as far as Veges I run 24 hours there

559
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:06,879
are sometimes in certain plants uh that

560
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,798
maybe require a little bit less light or

561
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,320
or whatever you know depending on the

562
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,759
time of the year as well you know

563
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,200
because of heat and stuff like that I'll

564
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,720
run stuff shorter but for the most time

565
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,278
and I don't know if this stems back from

566
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,880
growing a lot of ol flowers I just like

567
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,440
to push them as much as I can and uh but

568
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,799
that being said that's you know you can

569
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,038
run it there's all kinds of different

570
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,519
ways you can set up your light and

571
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:27,240
that's another thing I think that is a

572
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,679
top of that if you want to dive really

573
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,000
deep into that kind of just join the

574
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,480
Discord and and there's a lot more

575
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,640
people that know a lot of

576
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,480
[ __ ] yeah there's a yeah there's a lot

577
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,840
to read about as far as that goes we're

578
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,360
you know yeah we're new as well and so

579
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,639
as far as that you know as far as lights

580
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:45,759
goes the biggest things that I would

581
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,240
talk about when you go to buy one um is

582
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,599
make sure that you're getting enough

583
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,798
light for the space that you're going to

584
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:54,319
be growing in um yeah that you can you

585
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:57,158
know obviously just look that up just

586
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,639
Google how much light you need for the

587
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,480
amount of space you're going growing in

588
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,360
and you can find tons of way you know

589
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,038
tons of ways to figure that out yeah

590
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,678
yeah I mean if if most of the time on

591
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,400
all the lights that I've bought in the

592
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,798
last few years you know they all have a

593
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,759
description on them I think that's the

594
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:15,440
most important thing if you plan to grow

595
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:17,158
in a 2 by two then look for a light

596
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,679
that's going to be appropriate for you

597
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,760
you know if that's a almost all lighting

598
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,960
companies have different ranges of

599
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,038
Lights uh more advanced yeah in my

600
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,919
experience I would say that most of the

601
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,440
lights tend to say that they're good for

602
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,720
a space that is actually bigger than

603
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,960
what they really are good for um so I

604
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,278
think uh what I would say as far as this

605
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,519
goes is just kind of um read some

606
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:47,119
reviews get a handful of Lights in mind

607
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,440
that are good for the size of your space

608
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,959
and watch a few reviews on YouTube you

609
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,759
know that kind of thing there are people

610
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,200
that are dedicated to looking at lights

611
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:56,599
and that stuff um but you just want to

612
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,480
make sure that you're getting something

613
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,918
from like a reputable company you know

614
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,400
that kind of thing because after all

615
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,919
like you know some of these are there

616
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,519
it's a lot of power that you're pushing

617
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,559
through them and you know the risk of

618
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,158
fire and stuff like that is a very real

619
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:11,079
risk so that is something that you need

620
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,159
to think about when you know if you were

621
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:16,199
buying any other kind of electronics

622
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,880
that you were going to run you know

623
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,558
basic you know daily and for like a

624
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,960
significant period like you would think

625
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,678
about that so you need to think about it

626
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,960
for lights and stuff too yeah I I think

627
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,440
you know when you're getting off the

628
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,840
ground it's okay to take a few cor you

629
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,840
know cut a few corners but when you're

630
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,678
talking about yeah for sure safety

631
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,599
things like your light I think that's

632
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,519
super important uh not only just because

633
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,319
of you know might get a fire you might

634
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,759
get shocked there's like a lot of stuff

635
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,240
I've actually personally been shocked so

636
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:44,359
it's like something I take kind of

637
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,519
serious you know when it comes to safety

638
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,439
because you don't think about that kind

639
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,119
of stuff until it happens to you right

640
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,038
so yeah I mean you know I hate pluging

641
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,479
people but I there's plenty of people or

642
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:57,919
I should say lighting companies out

643
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,759
there that you can Google um cheap ones

644
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,440
that are good almost all of them will

645
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,599
probably get you to to where you need to

646
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,240
be as far as finishing your veg and your

647
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,119
flower um you can go out to higher

648
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,558
towards I think we both kind of are more

649
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,959
on the higher end now in our growing uh

650
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:14,839
you know careers or whatever you want to

651
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,319
call not a career but in our in the

652
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:18,240
hobby that we're at a point where we got

653
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,278
a little bit of on the better side of

654
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,679
Lights um but I will will say that I've

655
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,599
also haven't I wouldn't go as far as

656
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,278
saying I've noticed a giant difference

657
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,879
just speaking from my own experience

658
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,640
maybe in the weight department but

659
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,278
that's you know a lot of that St and I

660
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,200
think like I think like the things to

661
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:35,720
think about really like in the quality

662
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,798
like in the price of the light is just

663
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,399
like like you know if the fixtures made

664
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:41,639
well and stuff like that you know like

665
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:46,319
yeah there becomes points outside of

666
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,240
whether or not the the um LED you know

667
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,319
chipset is the correct one right you

668
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,839
know there are different spectrums there

669
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,839
are different there's literally this

670
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:57,158
could be an entire episode on its own um

671
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:59,199
yeah I would just say that people need

672
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,080
to you know just really read about the

673
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,558
lights before you buy them you know um

674
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:07,558
because if you get on Amazon and you

675
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:10,918
just Google uh grow light there's tons

676
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:13,038
of different you know um results some of

677
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,440
them will say that they're a thousand

678
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,240
watts and they're you know they're

679
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,278
really not so just kind of look at like

680
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,000
actual wattage output and stuff like

681
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,119
that you know really kind of dig into

682
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,919
that a little bit um because there is a

683
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,839
lot of information there yeah I think

684
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,559
you know to put a point on that I think

685
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,398
to you know be careful too just because

686
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,319
like I think the easiest way to probably

687
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:36,158
get some good information is probably

688
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,519
joining a Discord that has a lot of

689
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,278
people that have grown for a long time

690
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,759
and just get the general opinion on

691
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,480
stuff and then also kind of using maybe

692
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,960
something like Reddit I mean you gotta

693
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,120
even have a little bit of caution with

694
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,319
Reddit a little bit but generally most

695
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,000
people will kind of be you can kind of

696
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,918
find the information you need there

697
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,519
that's kind of what I did um you know

698
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,480
and just about trial and era but I'll be

699
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,558
honest as far as lights are concerned I

700
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,919
think they're at a point now

701
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,440
where you're not unless you're like

702
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,440
trying to save a lot of money and skimp

703
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,679
like you're probably going to get a

704
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,840
decent light especially if you wait and

705
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,919
I would also advise maybe waiting till

706
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:15,599
like uh 420 or a holiday because a lot

707
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,480
of coming up there'll be good sales and

708
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,119
stuff yeah so definitely think about

709
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,519
those things um but I do think you're

710
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:25,918
right like with lighting technology I

711
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,960
think like um most companies offer um

712
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,640
similar fixtures at like similar price

713
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,759
points so you can definitely find that I

714
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,038
I think the most important thing when it

715
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,440
comes to a light that I actually am

716
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,359
going through right now as far I just

717
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,200
upgraded one of my lights it's having a

718
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,199
dimmer switch and most of them all now

719
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,600
have them on there but if you're like me

720
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,159
and you have some that are out of date U

721
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:49,079
and that being said that specific brand

722
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,640
um you know these lights are not broken

723
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,839
I just it's just time for me to get uh a

724
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,240
new light and get a dimmer switch so and

725
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,639
that is actually one those are some of

726
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,558
the cheaper lights on the market and

727
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,240
they've worked fantastic for my little

728
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,319
two by tws and stuff like that you know

729
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,000
yeah for sure but yeah so yeah

730
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,519
definitely lots of good resources out

731
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,640
there just do your research when you're

732
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:11,119
buying a light don't just uh buy the

733
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,120
cheapest one that's what I would say

734
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,519
yeah I mean yeah you could kind of get

735
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,959
lost in the sauce and and I really think

736
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,960
as a new grower we get so excited you

737
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,240
know about equipment and gear and you

738
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,919
can kind of like almost screw yourself

739
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,038
up by like overthinking it um something

740
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,759
I like to do with with my lights

741
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:32,519
excuse me and my bigger tents or my

742
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,200
flower intents is I like to buy at this

743
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,759
point I I kind of like to buy a light

744
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,759
that obviously has a dimmer on it and uh

745
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,119
that's a made a little bit bigger you

746
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:44,599
know because it's kind of like we were

747
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,879
talking about earlier it's never it's

748
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:48,879
never a good thing to buy a smaller

749
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,200
light but it's okay to always buy a

750
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,799
bigger light so if you want to upgrade

751
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,720
you can so like for me I am currently

752
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,319
not able to put 5x fives efficiently

753
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,278
into my space

754
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,918
without having sacrific like living

755
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:05,599
space so that being said soon as I move

756
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,399
which I'm going to be doing here soon

757
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,599
I'm going to upgrade to like five by

758
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:11,839
fives or 8 by eight or whatever you know

759
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,879
so like for me I had that in mind for

760
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,240
the future you know and trying to I

761
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,799
think that's something super important

762
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,319
when it comes to the lights and stuff

763
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,038
yeah for sure and I mean you know if you

764
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,839
have an LED and you're able to just run

765
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:23,759
it at

766
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:26,439
85% in your tent versus having a smaller

767
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:29,200
LED and that you have to run at 100% all

768
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,880
the time um you know that also decreases

769
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,399
the life of the fixture and stuff like

770
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,880
that you know there's just lots of

771
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,038
different there's lots of benefits to

772
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,159
getting something that's a little bit

773
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,200
bigger than what you need probably yeah

774
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,760
for sure man that's a good way to put it

775
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,120
um do you want to jump yeah let's yeah

776
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,359
so I was gonna say the next thing that I

777
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,119
would think about is like all right so

778
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,879
you've got a place to grow you've got

779
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,119
your environment dialed in you've got a

780
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,760
light forther to grow now you got to

781
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,518
feed them something then you got to have

782
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,038
some kind of medium that they're in

783
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:01,278
right I think like this is such such a

784
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:04,679
huge topic and such a it's littered with

785
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,319
just a mindfield you know

786
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,798
um I

787
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:12,000
don't the biggest thing that I would say

788
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,720
as far as this is concerned is every

789
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,038
company will tell you that their product

790
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,200
will grow you the best plants right um

791
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:23,798
and there are better products and worse

792
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,840
products but overall if you get a

793
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:30,000
reputable brand of uh some kind of

794
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:34,199
you know some you know personally I use

795
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,919
uh Cana a&amp; B um I you know I really like

796
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:41,480
Cana uh but you can use whatever you

797
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:44,799
want um but find something that um

798
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,240
is fairly basic you know like uh not a

799
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:50,000
ton of additives and stuff and just

800
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,480
learn those things and just you know

801
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,519
just keep it simple um I think like

802
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,960
learning good watering habits I say this

803
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,000
all the time but it was one one of the

804
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,960
biggest things that helped with my

805
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,519
growing was to really learn my watering

806
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,679
cycles and like really know like okay

807
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,519
this plant is ready to drink and right

808
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,840
um just feeling like and it's it's not

809
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,200
it's not super complicated it's just

810
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,079
repetition you know um so if you're if

811
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,880
you're picking your pots up every other

812
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,278
day and filling what they feel like and

813
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,480
that kind of thing and like knowing

814
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:27,519
where they're at you get a sense of uh

815
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,679
when they're ready for water you know

816
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,319
you can like if I pick up a one gallon

817
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,278
pot I can tell you you know this is dry

818
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,599
just just Bas you know just the way it

819
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:38,359
feels at this point you know something

820
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:41,000
that uh that really helped me with

821
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,959
watering um in the beginning to kind of

822
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,240
prevent myself from overwatering was

823
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,640
actually picking up one of those uh like

824
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,240
sprayers you know like a Roundup two

825
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,840
it's they're the bigger ones it's like a

826
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,159
two gallon uh sprayer and it's got

827
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,839
several different like um nozzle um you

828
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,320
could kind of adjust the nozzle to like

829
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:01,439
different types of streams and stuff so

830
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:04,398
what I actually been doing for the last

831
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,759
couple years is using that same one and

832
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:10,398
uh for like seedlings all set it on the

833
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:12,319
Mist so like that way not only am I not

834
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,518
overwatering I'm not like blowing my

835
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,000
plant over or accidentally spraying too

836
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,278
much water on it or whatever and kind of

837
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,240
knocking the seedling down it's real

838
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,038
gentle and then when I move up to like

839
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,079
the bigger uh a little bit older plants

840
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,638
maybe like a gallon or so or half

841
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,638
gallons I'll switch over to the fan and

842
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:30,959
that just helps me especially in plastic

843
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,439
pots because in my environment plastic

844
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,278
pots tend to like I I find myself like

845
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,880
overwatering in a plastic pot more than

846
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,679
I do in say a fabric pot um so for me

847
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,559
like that sprayers like helped

848
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,278
tremendously because I think you're 100%

849
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,038
right I think one of the biggest things

850
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,480
is definitely as a new beginner is

851
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,720
overwatering and you know well and

852
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,278
something too that I would say with

853
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,639
overwatering when I you know that what

854
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,720
you're saying is definitely right you

855
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:58,558
can like especially when they're small

856
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,960
like h they just flooding them with

857
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,000
water is is rough but you know in my

858
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,840
mind overwatering is not necessarily

859
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,200
like how much water you give to plant in

860
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,720
one watering it's just how frequently

861
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,600
you're watering the plant you know

862
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,440
that's true yeah so you need to make

863
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:16,638
sure that your pots are drying out

864
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,558
basically um you know that's uh you know

865
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:20,158
I'm not say I I certainly am not like

866
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,638
saying that you should have your plants

867
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,840
drooping every time that it's time to

868
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:28,158
water um but I you know when I have my

869
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,119
plants and veg part of like uh my

870
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,559
process of learning the plants while I'm

871
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,319
kind of like looking through something

872
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,240
will be to just literally just while

873
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,678
they're in veg let them dry out until

874
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,319
they droop one time just just uh water

875
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,080
them fully note when I water it and then

876
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,038
just watch how many days it takes for

877
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:49,000
them to Dro um and then that kind of

878
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,638
gives me an idea of like when you know

879
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,319
maybe I want to feed them a day before

880
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:58,479
that um so yeah just to give yourself

881
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:00,918
like a um kind of like a way to gauge

882
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,919
you know that kind of thing and that's

883
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:04,278
back um I kind of remember what my

884
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,799
thought I lost my train of thought up

885
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:08,038
there earlier of what I was going to get

886
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:09,200
at but um about how you said you know

887
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:11,158
it's good to get in there and kind of

888
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,759
lift your pots up and kind of feel you

889
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,440
know when they're dry and then and then

890
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,319
also when they're fully wet so you can

891
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,880
kind of get that gauge and I think what

892
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,038
I was getting at with that was as a new

893
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,000
beginner I think that's super important

894
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:23,638
uh you know a lot of people watch a you

895
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,079
know I'm not going to say any names but

896
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:27,479
they'll watch a video and they think

897
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,599
like I got to put a net on this I to do

898
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,599
this and like I think a lot of people

899
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,519
will bypass like the important steps of

900
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,480
learning how to properly grow cannabis

901
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,480
and I'm not saying I know but like I

902
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,278
think there is definitely that like um

903
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,000
Bond or or just through experience as

904
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,278
you go you look at the plants and you

905
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,319
can almost look at a plant and you

906
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,880
should you know get to that level

907
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,558
eventually where you can kind of gauge

908
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,600
what it needs by just looking at it or

909
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,079
at least narrow it down to like at least

910
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:57,480
two different possible things you know

911
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:59,638
and I think getting in there and picking

912
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,480
them up and another key Point what I was

913
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:03,959
going to get at was when you're doing

914
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,558
this also be looking for Herms because

915
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,840
that's another thing that can discourage

916
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:10,519
people really quickly is you know I know

917
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,480
myself like I didn't have a mentor or

918
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,000
people a club or anyone to really talk

919
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,000
to about this [ __ ] so whenever I would

920
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,918
see a Herm I would be like well I guess

921
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,480
this plant's done and I would be like

922
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,759
this is bad plant you know it's not

923
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,960
going to give me what I want so that

924
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,320
being said learning now when I see a

925
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,639
Herm a lot of times especially on a uh

926
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,119
from a if I pop a seed and it's the

927
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,480
seeded plant you know the plant from the

928
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,159
seed a lot of times you know the

929
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,039
hormones aren't as stable as they would

930
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:41,119
be maybe if you didn't or if you cloned

931
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:42,480
it so like that being said like

932
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,280
sometimes if you're just seeing them on

933
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,280
the lowers uh that being said the lower

934
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,159
of the the lower limbs of the plants or

935
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,079
maybe it's only a couple Herms or little

936
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,679
sacks that you're finding you can kind

937
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,919
of just pick those off and a lot of

938
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,480
times you'll be fine whereas like you

939
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,319
know a new grower might see that and

940
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,039
will think like dang do I got a mail

941
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,320
like is this what's going on here and I

942
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,639
mean just in general I think like I

943
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,280
think that the biggest takeaway is

944
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,519
spending time with your plants is the

945
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,400
only way to learn your plants there's no

946
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,239
other there's no other substitution for

947
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,838
it if you want to grow the plant the

948
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:18,358
best possible than being around it and

949
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:20,838
seeing how it responds to different

950
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:24,039
things is the only way to do that on

951
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:27,480
that on that point as well I would say

952
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:29,239
you know I have had people ask me like

953
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,280
about starting growing and stuff just

954
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:35,838
like you know friends and I always kind

955
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,320
of just recommend just maybe get

956
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:41,639
something like cocoa or some kind of

957
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,559
lightly amended soil and some kind of

958
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,960
you know uh trusted bottled um like uh

959
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:51,239
like liquid nutrient program and just

960
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,000
kind of follow like the um lower

961
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:55,399
recommended setting of their feeding

962
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,519
program and just just see what it does

963
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,639
you know yeah just do some drain to

964
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,838
waste um learn you how to water have

965
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,159
your environment dialed in you know get

966
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:06,880
learn how to turn the lights up and down

967
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:11,199
you know just things like that like it's

968
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,200
it sounds very basic um but you it

969
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,480
quickly becomes not that basic when

970
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,559
you're doing it well yeah and when

971
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,599
you're doing something like as a

972
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,400
beginner um I think like a lot of these

973
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,119
nutrient companies they have tons of

974
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,000
additives and different things and they

975
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,400
all tell you that they're going to make

976
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,639
your plant the best plant ever and um so

977
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,039
you you want to get those because

978
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:37,078
obviously you want the best plant ever

979
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,400
uh so you get those additives and you

980
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,800
know you end up in this place where

981
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,039
you're just adding stuff in and you

982
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,920
don't really know what each input is

983
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,000
doing so I think if you kind of just

984
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,159
start simple and then slowly add on to

985
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,318
your program you'll um you'll

986
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,598
uh I don't know I think you'll just be

987
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:55,920
able to gleam a lot more from that and

988
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,838
you know probably save yourself some

989
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,920
money and head and stuff like that in

990
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:03,000
the long run you know because most of

991
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,639
those programs are made uh with you know

992
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,480
like with those people in mind that just

993
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,239
want to go you know mix it up in water

994
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,159
or whatever so it's like a it's just an

995
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,879
easy way to start kind of seeing how to

996
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:17,000
grow I think yeah I think I think you're

997
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,800
100% right I think if I don't think you

998
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,480
need to be buying a bunch of especially

999
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,480
as a new grower and especially if you

1000
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,719
don't know what nitrogen or phosphorus

1001
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,280
or potassium is or what it does and heck

1002
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,358
I can't really even speak on it myself

1003
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,280
but what I can speak on is your canvis

1004
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,440
plant your basic plant is going to need

1005
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,000
those three things and it's going to

1006
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,480
need some cow mag is going to need some

1007
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,480
other Trace elements and things like

1008
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,000
that so I think like you said just get

1009
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,240
you a basic setup a basic uh onep part

1010
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,400
or even a two-part type thing for veg

1011
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:51,279
and flow and get you some cow mag and I

1012
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,000
mean people swear by glacier amendments

1013
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,800
and all this other stuff I would

1014
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,199
probably just stick away from that in

1015
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,440
the beginning and you can always build

1016
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,318
on and if you're not seeing the results

1017
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,519
you want then you can it's kind of like

1018
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:04,639
we we're talking about reading that

1019
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:06,358
plant and that relationship building

1020
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,838
you'll know if something's not right if

1021
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:09,679
you're not if you don't have good leads

1022
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,199
and even and you know even I'll say even

1023
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:15,519
CAG I you know I've done several grows

1024
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,759
where I've not used anything but can of

1025
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:21,199
am now uh to just kind of get an idea of

1026
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,079
what it looks like yeah and generally

1027
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,719
speak I mean you know there's always

1028
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,200
going to be things that when you finish

1029
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:30,559
your growth you feel like you can

1030
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:35,078
improve on I think um yeah but I just

1031
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:38,279
think if you're new get uh get you know

1032
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:41,240
a two or three part nutrient system get

1033
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,040
some you know cocoa or what you know

1034
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:46,799
some promix and you know just just start

1035
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:49,400
growing you know yeah um you'll learn

1036
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,800
you'll learn quickly like you'll become

1037
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,639
obsessed with it like we are and you'll

1038
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,000
be reading about calcium and all sorts

1039
00:38:54,639 --> 00:39:01,078
of stuff but you know just take it one

1040
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,599
step at a time I guess I would just say

1041
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,640
um you know from the way I would do it

1042
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,079
and maybe not necessarily recommend but

1043
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:09,679
just the the if I was going to do it all

1044
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,000
over again with the knowledge that I had

1045
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:17,759
I guess I would I would lean more into

1046
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,559
like your um a basic soil um maybe for

1047
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,599
example like Fox Farm uh ocean and then

1048
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,400
strawberry and then just to break it

1049
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,640
down to the most basic level of doing it

1050
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,720
is usually I do a two-part um ocean and

1051
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,920
then I do a one part strawberry um for

1052
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:37,719
most of my pots um I think something

1053
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,200
else that uh you could do is have your

1054
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:42,039
bottles on standby because like most of

1055
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:45,118
the time you can kind of set yourself up

1056
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:46,719
with just the soil to get you to veg and

1057
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,880
not really have to do anything maybe

1058
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,279
just a little cow magag just depending

1059
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,119
on your situation and stuff um for me

1060
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,079
where I lean into nutrients or bottles

1061
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,440
for example is during flour and that's

1062
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:00,800
usually like if I'm seeing

1063
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,240
um usually by week three to four I'm I'm

1064
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,119
I'm I'm hitting with a little bit of

1065
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,479
flour noes and I think something that

1066
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:09,240
being said if you are doing soil do it

1067
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,280
in really small increments you don't I

1068
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,199
have very very rarely found that I

1069
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,000
needed to give as much as they

1070
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:19,318
recommended you know yeah just as a

1071
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,559
general rule of thumb I always start at

1072
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:24,358
like half strength what they recommend

1073
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:27,920
as normal for pretty much any nutrient

1074
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:30,639
line um yeah you know and you can start

1075
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,880
that with seeds and you know just kind

1076
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:36,199
of see what they do and yeah it's it all

1077
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,240
of these things are just um you have to

1078
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,838
observe it you know you have to just try

1079
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,919
it yeah and I think we could get this

1080
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:45,400
could be an hourlong Topic in itself and

1081
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,358
maybe what we could do is kind of do

1082
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,119
some grow along videos in the future and

1083
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,078
kind of just give a visual

1084
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,039
representation to people that are

1085
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,359
watching and um that you know the kind

1086
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,880
of stuff that we're talking about and

1087
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:58,519
how we handle things I think uh would be

1088
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,160
a lot easier because like you said

1089
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:02,199
earlier this is a a big conversation and

1090
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,838
I know there's going to be a lot of

1091
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:06,078
people watching that are saying you know

1092
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,480
what about Organics what about this and

1093
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,280
you know it's kind of like what we were

1094
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,159
saying before we're this is why it's

1095
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,560
called The Amateur hour because we were

1096
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,480
amateurs at this we're still learn

1097
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,119
ourselves and we can only speak on it

1098
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,079
from our own perspectives and the way

1099
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,920
that we do it so like you know I think

1100
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,000
that being said that always keep trying

1101
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,358
to learn you know try new methods I

1102
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,960
think as a beginner grower that's the

1103
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,039
biggest thing and don't give up if

1104
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,000
you're seeing issues try to work through

1105
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,400
them and that's you know just build that

1106
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,318
language or that relationship with the

1107
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,318
plants and you before you know it uh you

1108
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,400
you'll be able to kind of navigate that

1109
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,719
pretty easy just by look visual looking

1110
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,599
at them you know and stuff like that um

1111
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,919
yeah and and I think like it's yeah

1112
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,720
you're absolutely right the biggest

1113
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,519
thing I would say is just that we are

1114
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:52,919
not saying um this is necessarily even

1115
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,440
the best way to grow you know but as far

1116
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,440
as starting out as a beginner you've

1117
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,440
never grown a plan before or you're very

1118
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,760
you know have very limited you know uh

1119
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,440
experience with it I think these kind of

1120
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,000
doing it very simply to start out with

1121
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,200
uh is going to give you the you know the

1122
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,280
best possible experience with it and

1123
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:16,118
then you're more than you know you can

1124
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,280
start adding stuff in and like seeing

1125
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:21,400
how it you know obviously you you're GNA

1126
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:25,400
always want to improve so uh just give

1127
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:28,079
yourself some time to learn yeah I I I

1128
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,680
think it it kind of comes full circle to

1129
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,000
just learning in your environment what

1130
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:34,879
works for you and I think it is going to

1131
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,400
be like you said an investment uh

1132
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,599
because you are going to make mistakes

1133
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,960
and have times where you you know you

1134
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,079
think it's not going to go the way you

1135
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,240
want or you get Herms or or your plants

1136
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,680
not doing good and I think to get to

1137
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,439
that place where everybody really wants

1138
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,960
to be and that I guess at the end of the

1139
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,400
day is just having good smoke for

1140
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,519
ourselves um you know uh you just got to

1141
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,160
keep trying and keep experimenting and

1142
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,639
finding out what works for you you know

1143
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:02,799
y yeah yeah and I mean I think yeah it's

1144
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,639
all it's yeah you as as you start to

1145
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,280
dial things in you'll just get better

1146
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:10,639
and better and um you'll just be you

1147
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,000
know uh more and more satisfied with it

1148
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:16,039
I think yeah I think this that the

1149
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,079
nutrient or or you know feeding your

1150
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:22,199
plants is such a huge topic that you

1151
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:25,400
know it is worth like full traps it's

1152
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,838
it's full it's huge we could spend three

1153
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,559
or four hours like going through the

1154
