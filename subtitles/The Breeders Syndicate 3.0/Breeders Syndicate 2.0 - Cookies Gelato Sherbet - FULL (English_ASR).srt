my fellow host not so dog good evening

15
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,739
everyone we are here for another weekend

16
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:10,459
of uh fun fact-filled Journeys in uh

17
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,459
strain history

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,978
so tonight we were thinking about

19
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,719
covering something that we we don't

20
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,539
normally talk about a whole hell of a

21
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,579
lot as far as like getting deep into the

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,400
details of cookies since it's a modern

23
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,500
lime you know like we try to spend our

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,118
our time on older lines for the most

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,359
part A lot of the bass lines but cookies

26
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:33,478
I feel has become uh somewhat of a

27
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,359
baseline now For Better or For Worse uh

28
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:39,299
what do you think on that

29
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,239
um I agree with you Matt and I certainly

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,280
uh picked you know starting

31
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,078
um his history a long time ago simply

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,079
because there was way less people to get

33
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,298
pissed and complain uh about what we

34
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,758
were talking about and you know it's

35
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,799
it's also one of those things that um

36
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,299
it's probably not well known by a lot of

37
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,040
people you know and there's a lot of

38
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,320
disparate facts and little bits and

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,180
pieces that you gather up

40
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,359
um and so we've been slowly working our

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,000
way towards more modern stuff

42
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,860
and uh you know cookies is obviously and

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,800
like that whole family that it spawned

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,280
uh is is a big part of cannabis these

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,620
days uh and it's it um you know it's a

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,900
lot more delicate uh because cookies is

47
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,879
also like you know intending on being a

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,980
global brand and there's a lot of

49
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,959
business and money behind it and it's

50
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,119
not as simple of like a clandestine

51
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,319
story as maybe some of the older stories

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,319
are

53
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,419
um you know and but uh and all the

54
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,818
people are still alive and around as

55
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,139
well yeah yeah you know

56
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,359
um so there's a lot of different angles

57
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,179
we could attack it from and we'll we'll

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,060
pick some of them and go from there

59
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,939
I was thinking like a um let's start

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,420
with a quick discussion on the culture

61
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,759
in 2009 roughly when cookies was

62
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,899
starting to gain it's a foothold you

63
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,000
know

64
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,459
um what kind of stuff was going on in

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,680
NorCal the Bay Area when cookies was

66
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,259
blowing up it was a little bit during

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,939
the purple craze and all that yeah or

68
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,459
was it slightly um no I think it was

69
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,139
later okay I think it was I think it was

70
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,939
later I mean like for let's put it this

71
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,119
way for you what would you consider the

72
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,859
start of like I heard about this thin

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,780
mint cut

74
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,940
I didn't start hearing about it until

75
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,640
2010

76
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,739
right around then okay so let's just

77
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,018
let's just say you know

78
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,759
um obviously like as as with anything

79
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,140
there's people that are in the know and

80
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,699
then it spreads slowly and then

81
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,799
eventually it becomes more common

82
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:41,699
knowledge and then it's like a famous

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,400
thing right yeah uh so you know at that

84
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,139
time I I still lived uh in the same area

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,019
that I do now I still lived in Mendocino

86
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,419
County so the bay is only where all this

87
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,640
kind of begins is like only a couple of

88
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,339
two and a half hours south of us for the

89
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,798
most part okay um and the two things are

90
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,560
pretty tightly related in a lot of ways

91
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,239
um there was a lot of back and forth uh

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,000
in the Cannabis scenes between the Bay

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,140
Area and Mendo and Humboldt especially

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,120
right yeah uh and I would say

95
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:18,000
honestly probably in the 2009 2008

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,899
2009-2010 era I would say that era for

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,300
the both the bay and Mendocino County uh

98
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:28,079
was you know it was still significantly

99
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,780
a gas era yeah uh I would say that the

100
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:34,079
the Diesels and the headbands and the

101
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:37,978
cushes especially uh were all in high

102
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,719
demand uh getting good pricing right and

103
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,659
lots and lots of people were growing

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,900
them and that was sort of like the the

105
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,939
bread and butter if you were okay

106
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,918
that's kind of like

107
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,779
I mean it's obviously there's way more

108
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,918
to it than that is but in terms of like

109
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:59,819
what was the the big Dynamic back then

110
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,740
um you know I mean so 2008 2009 you know

111
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,759
there was an enormous amount of kush

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,978
being grown in the Hills by me

113
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,060
um that was all destined for clubs down

114
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:14,099
by you yeah right yeah

115
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,860
you know SoCal area there was a big oval

116
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,199
in California uh the bay was sort of a

117
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,300
meeting ground in the middle

118
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,400
um you know and and stuff like that and

119
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,220
so you know the bay was sort of like the

120
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:28,799
Hustler area the bay was where a lot of

121
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,860
all the NorCal weed flowed into

122
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,360
yeah you know and all that and so a lot

123
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,038
of the people in the bay were Hustlers

124
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
even if they were you know there were

125
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,159
you know there was warehouses and stuff

126
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,139
like that here or there but like land

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,840
places were expensive and it was the

128
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,639
city and it wasn't as easy to be

129
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,439
um you know the way you could be saying

130
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,900
Humboldt or Mendo or somewhere a little

131
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,120
bit more rural yeah

132
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,219
so who are some of the the players in

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,899
the early cookie scene do we want to go

134
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,100
over that at all or

135
00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:02,399
well I mean I think I mean there's you

136
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,220
know there's uh

137
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,899
there's really well-known players yeah

138
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,520
obviously and then there's a few people

139
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,918
that aren't particularly as well known

140
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:14,038
yeah um and you know we could obviously

141
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,839
step in a bunch of landmines on this one

142
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,300
um because all these players are still

143
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,418
active and around yeah and I'm sure they

144
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,418
have their own take on it

145
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,519
um and their own version of it you know

146
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,959
and so they'd probably also be quick to

147
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,839
point out any kind of small

148
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,758
discrepancies yeah uh that might pop up

149
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,918
as well to try to like discredit the

150
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,360
whole thing or whatever so

151
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,359
um you know because cookies is not just

152
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,300
it's not like talking about a lot of the

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,879
other strains uh in cannabis cookies is

154
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,460
like the one that formed a brand yeah

155
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,399
you know it was like it was like the

156
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,680
first modern cannabis brand in that

157
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,918
regard and you know in the cookie stores

158
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,620
and fame and it happened like you know

159
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,599
we could maybe talk about like the where

160
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,360
cannabis was at

161
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,680
when it popped up

162
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,840
that's what I was talking about the

163
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,600
culture the culture

164
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,939
so I mean as far as as far as my neck of

165
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,699
the woods in Northern California

166
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:16,759
um it was uh the green Rush was

167
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,720
massively on in my area

168
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:24,479
2008 2009 2010 were booming times for

169
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,280
indoor light depth full outdoor of all

170
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,439
kinds of things all over my neck of the

171
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,399
woods what's that indoor indoor pound

172
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:35,699
rate Circa 2008 2009.

173
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,439
uh I mean like for high quality the do

174
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,660
the prices people would have been seeing

175
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,459
for Quality OG cushion or like you could

176
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,280
you could I mean you could get I could

177
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:48,258
get 4200 like in my neighborhood yeah

178
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,879
exactly okay for ends you know yeah

179
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:53,460
especially for desirable things you know

180
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,800
like um you know gassy strains certainly

181
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,538
uh certainly Kush

182
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,699
um you know there was a lot of there was

183
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:02,038
a lot of game back then where people

184
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,259
from Southern California their entire

185
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,538
career was like coming up to my neck of

186
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,759
the woods buying things at that and

187
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:11,159
going down to dispensaries in the

188
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,199
southern part of the state and you know

189
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,220
giving them to then those dispensaries

190
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,080
for three 400 margin 500 margin

191
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,139
so that was big business then there was

192
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,800
that was full deaf years depths were big

193
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,300
then there was still droughts back then

194
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,759
so you know depths commanded good

195
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,079
pricing uh you did you did things well

196
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,639
and it was one of those it was

197
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,379
definitely a gas era I mean not that

198
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,598
there wasn't lots of things being grown

199
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:40,080
but there was an enormous demand for

200
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,300
both Kush and diesels of various kinds

201
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,820
so all kinds of permutations of those

202
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,799
got grown quite a bit because they

203
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,260
because a lot of the the people coming

204
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,759
up and then you know if if you wanted to

205
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,639
leave your area

206
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,159
the vast majority of people that would

207
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,958
leave Sonoma County or Mendo or Humboldt

208
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,600
or wherever if they wanted to go

209
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,179
somewhere and hustle their stuff they

210
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,040
generally went to the Bay yeah well that

211
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,259
was San Francisco or the East Bay in

212
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,539
Oakland somewhere right around there and

213
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,879
the bay was sort of like a a collection

214
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,099
ground for everybody from SoCal coming

215
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,259
up but that didn't want to go all the

216
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,759
way up into the hills I mean there was

217
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,939
people from all over

218
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,740
in the bay looking to get it was sort of

219
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,100
a Clearing House

220
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,080
for where a lot of the weed uh from my

221
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,180
region ended up at least momentarily

222
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,740
even if it was just passing through on

223
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,559
its way to somewhere else

224
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,580
like say dispensaries in San Diego or

225
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,759
you know uh or LA or anywhere like that

226
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,740
right

227
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,419
it was was booming in the bay during

228
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,419
those years if I remember correctly the

229
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,699
Oracle the GDP all of that like a staple

230
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,500
of that Bay Area yeah it was a staple

231
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,839
and I mean I would also say it was

232
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,220
starting to get by then it was starting

233
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:02,459
to get phased out yeah um in favor of uh

234
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,379
cush and you know I mean cush was

235
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,059
getting still

236
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,879
um pretty damn high prices in Southern

237
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,979
California down down back yeah so if you

238
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,080
had access to cuts

239
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,539
um you know it moved easily and you got

240
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,139
a good price point you know and that was

241
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:21,838
certainly the height of uh the the gas

242
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:23,939
diesel craze too so there was a lot of

243
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,300
that sloshing around

244
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,040
um Urkel and GDP and and Grape Ape and

245
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:34,259
Mendo p and all that stuff I think that

246
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:36,838
was more like 2005 2006 6 2007 and then

247
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,659
like the wave of gas

248
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,760
really started to come through so what

249
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,199
do you think was the was the

250
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,899
um

251
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,500
what do you think made what became

252
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,539
cookies appealing in a time where yield

253
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,820
was still relatively important maybe not

254
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:55,139
the most important because OG had taken

255
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,360
dominance and it wasn't like a power

256
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,000
yielder for most people but what do you

257
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,579
think uh drove the necessity for cookies

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,259
all of a sudden that drive and hype when

259
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,778
there was already OG Kush and there was

260
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:09,659
already a like you say a waning demand

261
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:11,639
for GDP and Urkel

262
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,500
um well I think it was a number of

263
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,799
factors and I think

264
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:21,240
one one thing you can say about it is

265
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:23,759
that Americans are pretty tribal right

266
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,259
um but mostly we're not tribal like uh

267
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,939
we're not tribal in the way that a lot

268
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,179
of other countries are tribal like we're

269
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,220
a weird mishmash of cultures so we get

270
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,199
tribal around like sports teams and

271
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,240
stuff like that right

272
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,120
um and one of the things that like I

273
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,639
think pushed it was that I would say

274
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,759
it's probably fair to say in California

275
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,578
that LA and SoCal was considered like

276
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,338
kushland yeah yeah even if it was

277
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:52,319
produced other places like The Craze the

278
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,959
money the rep all that different types

279
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,600
of stuff La gotta got it right yep and

280
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,338
for the bay uh cookies was really

281
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,379
something that like all of a sudden was

282
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,360
the base

283
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,220
okay you know the bay wasn't just like a

284
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,019
clearing ground for the Emerald Triangle

285
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,579
it wasn't just like a pass-through it

286
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,179
was something they could claim as their

287
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:14,458
own yeah it was very much a bay set of

288
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:16,379
cuts and so just like that like you're

289
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,699
gonna have fans of it and we just like

290
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,659
you have fans like the San Francisco

291
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:24,180
Giants or the Oakland A's or the Raiders

292
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,980
you know or anything like that like

293
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,379
that's our [ __ ]

294
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,659
right this is unique to us and then on

295
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,820
top of that since it become since it

296
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:34,500
sort of started there the people that

297
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,300
were in the know and all the people that

298
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,778
first got it were kind of from there

299
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:41,159
yeah right so humans like to feel like

300
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:43,259
they're part of something special right

301
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,799
yeah for sure everybody likes to beat

302
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:48,659
huh fomo well everybody likes to feel

303
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,939
like they're on the In Crowd on some on

304
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:53,399
some aspect of things you know and a lot

305
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,339
of the history of a lot of the history

306
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,278
of the of of that that became you know

307
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:02,940
and it made people famous too right yeah

308
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,980
um and so I do think that cookies came

309
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,260
along at a really weird time in cannabis

310
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,680
in the sense that

311
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:13,740
um it was a sea change in my opinion

312
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,299
right where probably before cookies

313
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,820
uh this isn't going to make cookie sound

314
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:21,120
that good but before cookies

315
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,680
um most weed was judged on its nose and

316
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,220
effect

317
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,120
right uh and looks wasn't that big of a

318
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,399
deal

319
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,379
right I mean I I can't tell you how many

320
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,720
times I would have people come up to my

321
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,480
neck of the woods and they would open up

322
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,339
a contractor bag of Sour and they would

323
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,740
stick their head in it and look up and

324
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,540
say this will work yeah and it was

325
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,799
before they even really like dug around

326
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,019
I mean they could still find something

327
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,359
in it that they didn't like but for the

328
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,179
most part if the nose hit them like a

329
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,560
hammer in the face yeah you were almost

330
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,759
all the way there

331
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:59,578
right was super important and cookies

332
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:02,639
like you know is extremely photogenic

333
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:06,239
and it came about kind of at the uh at

334
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,860
the end of of a certain era where

335
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,019
um you know IG started happening and

336
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,620
these different social media platforms

337
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,639
started happening right and uh it looked

338
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,778
gorgeous

339
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
yeah

340
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:19,439
right and you you can't you know

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,958
anything you're looking at on Instagram

342
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,300
or anything else you can't smell it you

343
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:27,838
can't smoke it you can't but you can see

344
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:30,479
it yeah and cookies uh and a lot of its

345
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,240
children are extremely photogenic

346
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,860
they're beautiful right I know that was

347
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,000
the first thing that truly caught my eye

348
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,300
was well

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,679
I'd seen stuff similar I remember uh you

350
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:42,240
know there was stuff that would come out

351
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,219
of different Combos and we'll get into

352
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,019
that later that I'd seemed similar but

353
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,399
I'd never seen anything quite capture

354
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,959
all of

355
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,339
several traits in One Bud but I also saw

356
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,259
the yield and thought there's no way

357
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,839
this is going to catch on there's just

358
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:59,458
no [ __ ] way this is gonna catch on

359
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,680
you know

360
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:05,099
yeah I mean and I think some of it too

361
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:07,739
is you know they uh they got it to some

362
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,480
hip-hop artists and they got it and they

363
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,220
and they got it wrapped about and you

364
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,800
know there's if you get it to if you get

365
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,139
things to cultural trendsetters right

366
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:20,039
yeah then other people might want it

367
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:24,000
yeah you know and there was a lot there

368
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:27,179
was a lot of well-developed Clubs

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,120
um selling a lot of indoor in 2008 2009

370
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:32,219
2010 all that that era right there was a

371
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,740
bunch of Bay Area clubs

372
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,019
um and back then if you had an active

373
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,259
medical card that checked out you could

374
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,940
go make a deal with a club yep

375
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,139
you didn't have to have like today you

376
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,519
didn't have to have a bunch of permits

377
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,980
and a bunch of special rules and

378
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,740
regulations you literally had a doctor's

379
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,180
note and you set up an account and you

380
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,899
were allowed to I mean that was kind of

381
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:56,338
the way 215 worked yeah right was you

382
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,039
were allowed to supply dispensaries

383
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,779
right yeah and so there were and you

384
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,899
know and what people ended up calling

385
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:06,120
top shelf ended up being indoor

386
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,679
yeah you know not always there was a lot

387
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,139
of light depth back then that made top

388
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,879
shelf and stuff like that but I think

389
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,100
you know when you're buying something at

390
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,919
a store or something that looks really

391
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,540
attractive is a big seller yeah and it

392
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:20,458
was different

393
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:22,078
right it was very different

394
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,719
um the way cookies looks the way it's

395
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,159
buds form uh they're very dense they're

396
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,259
very tight

397
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,659
um they look really pretty uh the way

398
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:34,620
that it has a tendency to color up

399
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:37,198
really like accents the THC you can see

400
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,078
the crystal it has a lot of visible

401
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,819
Crystal yeah you know

402
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:46,319
um and it did kind of have like an off

403
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,899
cookie dough type of sweet aroma

404
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,060
and I think it's the first line that

405
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,720
like modern marketing really mattered

406
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,979
with

407
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,320
yeah

408
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,940
in a way yeah you were posting something

409
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,100
up there for a minute but I I couldn't

410
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,139
see what it was no I was just getting it

411
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,839
ready it's it's a it's the video where

412
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,818
they first explain the genetics behind

413
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,318
cookies and whatnot so whenever we're

414
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,838
ready to get into that part I'm going to

415
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,699
toss that up so we can hear it from some

416
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:15,779
of the First videos ever posted by them

417
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,400
uh the cookie crew so maybe I'll throw

418
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,318
in something like this a little bit too

419
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,199
where

420
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,899
um I uh

421
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,759
Matt and I did a Thanksgiving show on

422
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,199
sour because we figured if you're you

423
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,940
know fighting on Thanksgiving with

424
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,380
families pretty traditional so if we

425
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,840
talk about something that gets people

426
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,340
riled up that'll work

427
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,259
um and cookies is also probably gonna

428
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,000
rile people up and there's a bunch of

429
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,980
big players that are involved in cookies

430
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,279
and they all have their versions and

431
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,440
stories and whatnot and so you know take

432
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,779
this as sort of like General tidbits

433
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,640
rather than some like completely

434
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,980
chronological

435
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,200
you know attempt to lay out the history

436
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,819
yeah right

437
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,319
um because you know the history with

438
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:00,298
cookies like I said it's not just about

439
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,220
the weed anymore it's about different

440
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:05,879
people's careers

441
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,279
yep now yep you know and lots of careers

442
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,500
were set up by different stories lots of

443
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,599
stories are conflicting

444
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,058
um I've heard all kinds of stories from

445
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,339
beginning to end but what like I've I've

446
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:19,798
said in many of our shows before I've

447
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,139
learned a lot of times you can if you

448
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,900
grow enough progeny enough plants enough

449
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,120
seeds of a certain line the plants will

450
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,500
tell you exactly what they are if you

451
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,119
have enough experience and know enough

452
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,619
about the bass lines the plants will

453
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,759
tell you exactly what they are and

454
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,079
that's what I've always been more

455
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,119
interested in when it comes to cookies

456
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,339
not the people behind it not the players

457
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,199
behind it but what it actually is and

458
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,418
what we're seeing when it breeds you

459
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,038
know that's where I always run too so

460
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,700
that's where that's where I'm mostly

461
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:49,619
going to focus my portion of uh stuff is

462
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,900
when I talk about like the the breeding

463
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:55,019
traits and how I see them breed and

464
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,940
whatnot but we can cover some of that

465
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,400
historical aspect

466
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,019
um yeah so do you want me just to fire

467
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,179
up the video now or do you want to cover

468
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,740
anything else in the beginning precursor

469
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,720
no I think the beginning part I think

470
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,660
like if we're talking about like setting

471
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,519
the stage for what happened yeah uh we

472
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,320
probably you know it's probably it's

473
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,418
it's there was a bunch of just there was

474
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,418
a 215 was probably was probably the

475
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,940
height of 215. yeah the height you know

476
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,640
is really when it came out a height of

477
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,038
215 error there was a lot of explosion

478
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,960
of cannabis going on there was a lot of

479
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,279
new Growers coming into the scene there

480
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,400
was a lot of younger people getting

481
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,960
involved it had spread to the point and

482
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,460
become chill enough to the point even

483
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,500
though you could totally get busted on

484
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,240
any number of different levels that all

485
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,538
kinds of people were jumping into it

486
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,000
that hadn't wanted to before yeah

487
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:47,220
business was booming dispensaries were

488
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,839
booming everything was booming and if if

489
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,819
I remember correctly like the first cut

490
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,220
I had heard of was cherry pie out of all

491
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:55,200
those of that group I mean they had as

492
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,759
you know F1 derb and a few other things

493
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,580
that were in their Circle but the first

494
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,798
one that I heard about before cookies or

495
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:03,418
any of that was the Cherry Pie and that

496
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,179
was that was what I was most familiar

497
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,860
with uh online before the cookies kind

498
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,860
of exploded and it had a similar look

499
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:14,819
but it was more OG looking to me than

500
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:17,159
the the nug structure of the cookies was

501
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:18,359
that something you guys saw up there uh

502
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,600
do you remember a certain date of it

503
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,859
popping up or any of that yeah I mean I

504
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,500
um

505
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:27,240
you know I'll I'm gonna I'll dance

506
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,700
around certain aspects of it just

507
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,798
because of the of what we're at but I

508
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,538
can say that there are some people that

509
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,480
were intimately involved in cookies that

510
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:37,619
I have gone way back with right and I

511
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,019
knew

512
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:41,819
um uh you know years and years and years

513
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,918
before this stuff came about so there

514
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:46,379
was certain things that I saw

515
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,600
um before cookies became famous I mean

516
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,980
one of the one of the guys uh that's

517
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:51,178
involved

518
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,140
um for instance

519
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,840
um he gave me the Flow Rider yeah and I

520
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,340
want to say 2004 spring 2004 or

521
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,139
something like that

522
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:03,178
um and so that was the first actual like

523
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,480
living in Northern California I was a

524
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:09,059
little bit uh behind the cush wave

525
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,400
um in terms of like access to cuts that

526
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:13,200
were specifically Kush

527
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,538
um but that was the first one that I

528
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,779
used to that I used to

529
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:20,279
um uh I used to rock you know and so

530
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:23,460
that was that was four or five years

531
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,619
before cookies even popped up yeah right

532
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,140
and it just so happens because that same

533
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:31,199
crew had that cut that that kush Cut Is

534
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,080
the is the cushion cookie yeah right

535
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,819
that's the question so that's so and I I

536
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,939
just believe it just because of who it

537
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,200
came from and who had access to it and

538
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,820
all that different types of stuff I

539
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,558
don't have any I there's a lot of stuff

540
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:45,779
that with cookie that's a little

541
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:49,019
mysterious that one I think is pretty

542
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:52,200
standard yeah you know now what could

543
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:55,558
what cut exactly Flowrider is you know

544
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,480
is it is it a a cut of OG masquerading

545
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,399
under a different name is it a different

546
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,980
cut from Florida all that type of stuff

547
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,700
that that's a debate I suppose I got a

548
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,740
question

549
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,720
huh when you when you got it did they

550
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,140
call it flow writer did they call it

551
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,360
Florida OG do they call it Flo Rida or

552
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,840
did how did that happen where did that

553
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,658
put on it to be perfectly honest

554
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,298
um I uh

555
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:24,240
you know I got it as I got it as OG kush

556
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:26,759
yeah okay

557
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,319
um and then you know I got interested in

558
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,240
Kush and I'd heard a bunch of different

559
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,918
things and I went back to him and I

560
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,720
asked him so I hear there's a couple

561
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,780
different ones which one is it right

562
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,360
yeah yeah and you know he he said it was

563
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,220
I mean I'll probably mangle this

564
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,979
pronunciation but I never heard the word

565
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,740
Florida OG yeah right

566
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,500
um although it was a play on that I you

567
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:53,339
know it was it was a Florida

568
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,259
yeah almost almost like how uh uh uh you

569
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,359
know uh somebody with an accent would

570
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,980
say Florida yeah I love your southern

571
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,558
accent by the way that's good it's

572
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,839
terrible you know but anyway

573
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:06,298
um supposedly and I don't know if this

574
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,639
is true or not supposedly it was it was

575
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,658
it was sent from Jacksonville Florida to

576
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,100
the Bay

577
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,360
yeah

578
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,399
you know

579
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,379
um and at the time I thought my buddy

580
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,780
was like all generous uh for giving it

581
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,860
to me but what I realized way later was

582
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:21,538
that

583
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:23,639
um he was gonna he was giving me the

584
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:26,339
same price he was giving me for diesels

585
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,380
and other things you know which was low

586
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:31,379
fours and then he was taking it to LA

587
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,419
and like making mad loot off it yeah um

588
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,059
so I didn't get it like on some you know

589
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,799
it but that that that's the first one

590
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:41,099
it's still one of the best OG's I know

591
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,779
of to be honest uh the OG and cookies is

592
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:45,240
a really nice cut

593
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:48,058
so that was kind of my first that was

594
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,159
kind of my first uh as far as things

595
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,899
that were in cookie that I personally

596
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,360
possessed

597
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,580
um Flo that that kush cut is probably

598
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,279
the first one yeah you know

599
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:00,720
and I think what happened is uh in a

600
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,279
nutshell

601
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,500
um we can bounce around and there's a

602
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,960
lot of depth to all this but almost like

603
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,000
the like the diesel story I think there

604
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,860
was there was multiple accidental

605
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,579
pollinations

606
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:17,038
yeah that you know this this Herm down

607
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,839
to this we grew up seeds this thing got

608
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,220
named this we you know we played around

609
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,918
with it a couple a year and a half later

610
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,679
this Herms onto this you know so on and

611
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,700
so forth and then you know

612
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:32,659
um yeah we have some pretty good video

613
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,980
of well yeah pop it up they of them well

614
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:37,679
certain ones come in certain sections

615
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,720
but basically of them

616
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,880
um making it very clear that it was

617
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,519
probably her accidents because they say

618
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,500
they have no interest in breeding at all

619
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,740
so but what let's pop up the first one

620
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,980
this is uh this is I believe [ __ ] and

621
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,440
burner and uh Powers up Kenny Kenny

622
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,740
Powers they call him no not the guy with

623
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,019
the mullet much different guy uh and

624
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,460
they are discussing in a club I believe

625
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:06,240
the original video was called big

626
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,880
burner's bigger business episode one

627
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,940
um and yeah this is them discussing it

628
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,860
so let's pop it up here

629
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,120
break it down Jacob bro let them know

630
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:16,139
something what do they want to know I

631
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,699
mean first of all I see some YouTube

632
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,400
Vlogs where they said cookies got cherry

633
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,860
pie is that true

634
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,360
clear that up no

635
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,798
I'm just saying there's a lot of [ __ ] to

636
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,778
clear so let them go break it down baby

637
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,918
preach what do they want to know I mean

638
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,778
let's let them know what cookies is

639
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,120
first of all there's a lot of like weed

640
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:34,500
magazines and and like all kinds of

641
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,298
crazy [ __ ] that are just putting false

642
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,400
the relationship between cherry pie and

643
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:39,839
cookies directly is it's like I would

644
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,840
say more but like a brother and a sister

645
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,699
relationship they have the same parents

646
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,000
one of the same parent one of the half

647
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,798
of the parent is uh the F1 Durban

648
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,960
crossed with that

649
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:55,400
um with a granddaddy would make the

650
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,500
Cherry Pie F1 Durbin

651
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,778
crossed with the OG they give you the

652
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,579
cookie so that's where they get that's

653
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:04,919
where they get that that relationship

654
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:07,759
right there so that's what you know here

655
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,620
we go there's no there's no cherry pie

656
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,359
it's the dirt it's the F1 dirt and

657

682
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,080
of all I see some YouTube Vlogs where

683
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,240
they said cookies got Cherry Pie and is

684
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:11,819
that true

685
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,259
to clear that up no

686
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:14,700
I'm just saying there's a lot of [ __ ] to

687
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:16,740
clear so let me break it down baby

688
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,880
preach we really want to know I mean

689
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,679
let's let them know what cookies is

690
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,020
first of all there's a lot of like weed

691
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,340
magazines and and like all kinds of

692
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:25,139
crazy [ __ ] that are just putting false

693
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:27,298
the relationship between cherry pie and

694
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,679
cookies directly is it's like I would

695
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:30,960
say more but like a brother and a sister

696
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,298
relationship so basically it was

697
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,538
supposed to be the GDP and

698
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:39,599
um and and F Wonder making cherry pie

699
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:44,339
what's your thoughts on that

700
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:46,678
um that is uh that is not what I know of

701
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:48,319
okay and that might cause a bunch of so

702
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,600
what I think happened

703
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:55,019
realistically is

704
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,399
I don't think they wanted anyone to know

705
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:57,778
okay

706
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,240
um because I don't think they wanted

707
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:01,440
anyone to like try to recreate what they

708
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,099
had

709
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,740
and I think it's fair to say that no

710
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,418
matter who they might be currently

711
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,519
um back then

712
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,799
um the guys that that made it famous

713
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,740
were more Hustlers than they were

714
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:18,538
Growers and breeders yeah right they

715
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,278
were more people that that moved things

716
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:21,778
around that like they they were deeply

717
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:24,599
involved in the weed scene and stuff

718
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:27,480
like that but you know they they were

719
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,699
more middlemen than they were like

720
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,099
someone like you or me yeah who was

721
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,538
producing it you know making seeds you

722
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:34,619
know growing for Market all that

723
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:36,599
different types of stuff they just

724
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:38,699
weren't that way and so I think they

725
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,619
were concerned both that they didn't

726
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,720
want to give anybody credit all credit

727
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,339
with cookies starts with cookie fam

728
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,620
right

729
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:48,599
um and like a lot of places as we as

730
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:52,678
we've talked about many before times on

731
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:56,639
this show uh use you know use you work

732
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,620
off what you get first right you you get

733
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,419
work from other people and you get bag

734
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:01,798
seed or you get this or you get that and

735
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,820
then it gets famous and then what

736
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:05,099
happens

737
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:06,720
you want to make it seem like it all

738
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:10,019
originated from you

739
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,940
yeah right and I also think that maybe

740
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:14,220
even back then like I don't even think

741
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,740
they all had their story straight with

742
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,839
one another I doubt that they really

743
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,298
even knew what pollinated what I don't

744
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:24,298
think those guys could truly identify a

745
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:25,918
Herm in a room what was herming on what

746
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,740
and I think they did a lot of guesswork

747
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,720
personally like I

748
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,058
there ain't the brightest

749
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,100
well I don't think necessarily speaking

750
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:37,200
it's not the brightest but imagine

751
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:39,599
I'll be fair and I'll just say that

752
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,919
imagine that like your your story starts

753
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,178
with bagseed

754
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,179
yeah

755
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:47,000
right and now you have to now you have

756
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,500
this famous thing and it's blowing up

757
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,058
and you know like you're starting to

758
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,619
breed and do some different stuff with

759
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:55,200
it because you're trying to Market it in

760
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:58,199
a certain way but like all the steps

761
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,200
that got you to where it begins you

762
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,759
didn't actually do yeah right like I

763
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,460
mean for instance it's pretty well known

764
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:08,640
that Berner was a bud tender

765
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,100
um he didn't grow at all yeah right he

766
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,860
knew rappers and he had a small hip-hop

767
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:15,719
career that he was trying to work on

768
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,658
um and he was an outlet and he hyped

769
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,519
stuff and he moved stuff yeah and he he

770
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:23,278
made that into like you know he's a bit

771
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,960
obviously he's the face of cookie now

772
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,359
right

773
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,579
um but he's like yeah I mean he's the

774
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,219
one on um Forbes you know yeah

775
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,480
everything he's the face and you know

776
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,058
and that wasn't I don't even think that

777
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,399
was done intentionally like it was it

778
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:40,619
was almost like I think that as these

779
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,418
there's like a lot of things you know

780
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,319
there's there's a loose collection of

781
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,740
people

782
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:49,139
right and as Fame comes and there's no

783
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,538
contracts and there's no formal you know

784
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,179
organization everybody starts reaching

785
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:56,759
for everything they can get yeah and

786
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:58,380
there was winners and losers in that uh

787
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,298
at least so far there's some people that

788
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,860
are super well known and there's a few

789
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:03,720
people that were probably like more

790
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,579
responsible at least for the beginning

791
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,759
parts that aren't very well known at all

792
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:11,579
and that seems to me to be a um a common

793
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:14,700
theme in the history of cookies whether

794
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:17,519
you're at the beginning or you're making

795
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,558
your way down the road to you know the

796
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,440
the lemonade era and all that it sounds

797
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:24,658
like it's a repeating story that there

798
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,120
are a lot of really uh sometimes even

799
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,640
really talented people doing some work

800
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,879
behind the scenes that um don't get the

801
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,740
shine so yeah I mean well yeah there was

802
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,620
an there was an errand there was an ERA

803
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,220
too where back then especially

804
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:40,019
um

805
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,480
it was all about who wanted to show

806
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:45,000
their face yeah there was a couple

807
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,778
people that did not want to show their

808
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,119
face

809
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:50,579
and so as a result like barely anybody

810
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:52,619
knows who they are and people like

811
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:54,619
Berner and you know and [ __ ] and stuff

812
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,819
like that who were wanted to be famous

813
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:59,038
and wanted to use this to make

814
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:02,158
themselves famous yeah

815
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,980
um they became the face of it

816
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,039
right one got a raptor out of it and

817
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,019
yeah yeah you know and and became CEO of

818
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:11,759
cookies or whatever and you know and he

819
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:13,259
wasn't even involved in any of the

820
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,179
growing of cookies or any of the

821
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:17,759
breeding or anything like that he was

822
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:20,220
the guy that got you decent tickets for

823
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,960
it and you know and gave it to Wiz

824
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,399
Khalifa and these different people that

825
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,740
would hype it up and then these famous

826
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,058
people had it and he helped put it on

827
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,460
the map

828
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:31,918
you know and so when the people that

829
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:34,620
actually own cookies decided to like you

830
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,580
know form the brand they got the face of

831
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,979
it

832
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,379
they didn't really care necessarily so

833
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,480
much about like you know who was the

834
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,460
most involved or who who you know yeah

835
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,558
they cared about they needed a

836
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,538
spokesperson yep

837
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,398
a lot of major corporations do that

838
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:52,980
that's that's very common yep you know

839
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,839
and Berner was looking to be famous and

840
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,159
you know it was a good spokesperson

841
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,898
yeah

842
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,460
right

843
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:01,139
and I mean there was you know I used to

844
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,340
I used to joke that like there used to

845
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,720
be a bunch of people in the bay that

846
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,918
thought that the eighth of cookies they

847
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,460
were buying was like personally

848
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,899
hand-watered by butter yeah yeah I heard

849
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,058
that a lot people would get in big

850
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:15,239
arguments so they'd be like no no he's

851
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:17,158
growing it come on back in the day it

852
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,259
was a real bad you know and there was

853
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,880
there there was there was you know there

854
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:23,158
was definitely crew in the cookie fam

855
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,980
that was growing it yeah but that just

856
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,899
wasn't his angle yeah

857
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,720
you know they're just that just wasn't

858
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:33,959
his angle you know so

859
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,880
um and uh you know and and so as as a

860
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,340
result of all this Fame and stuff like

861
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,320
that there's a there's another

862
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:42,898
um there's another aspect of it where

863
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,480
all of them tried to make as much of it

864
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:48,538
as they could as out of out of it as

865
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,220
they could yeah of course right you know

866
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:52,259
I mean it spawned it didn't just spawn

867
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,899
cookie I mean it spawned although that

868
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:57,058
came later it spawned sherbinski's yes

869
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:59,579
you know and the sure brand and all that

870
00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:02,639
different types of stuff and gelato and

871
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:04,199
yeah and and you know and you know so

872
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,360
there's like a I mean this could be like

873
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,179
a multiple

874
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,739
multiple you know episode show I suppose

875
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,059
depending on what angle you want to take

876
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,358
on it

877
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:19,139
um but I I will say going back I do

878
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,819
think that part of the

879
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,280
what's the best way to put it part of

880
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,720
the confusion about cookie is that in

881
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,200
the beginning some of them honestly

882
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,178
didn't know all the steps yeah and I and

883
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,539
I do think that they also wanted to

884
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:35,519
obscure a bit what they did know

885
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:37,980
because they didn't want anybody else to

886
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,599
either get credit or you know go out and

887
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,019
grab those things and start making

888
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,879
things because as everyone's aware right

889
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,398
um you know cookie seeds and cookie

890
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,079
hybrids and OG KB and then forum and

891
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,179
animal and all these different things

892
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,878
that were coming out they all commanded

893
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,320
top dollar yeah so there was a lot of

894
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,139
money on the line

895
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,539
and they were always terrified of their

896
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,440
secret and their control of it getting

897
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,159
out

898
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,780
yep because again it got famous and it

899
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,338
got famous at this weird time where

900
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,579
things were transitioning but it was

901
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:14,338
still that 215 gray area time where

902
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:16,079
nobody owned it yeah

903
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:18,059
right it was very punk rock like nobody

904
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,920
nobody owned it no but there was no

905
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:22,139
contracts there was no documentation

906
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,599
there was no there was a loose group of

907
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:25,400
friends yeah that was only shortly to

908
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,780
come

909
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,700
right so there and there was really

910
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,019
wasn't a way I mean there was even a

911
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,399
thing where like

912
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,960
they would I don't you know they

913
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,119
wouldn't even let

914
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,880
um they kept they kept burner away from

915
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,380
the crows yeah you know and they gave

916
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,880
him the clothing company which ended up

917
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,800
being a dumb thing because he made a

918
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,320
[ __ ] ton of money off selling 150

919
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,800
t-shirts yeah he was the the real winner

920
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,880
in that one you know and and it also

921
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,980
didn't have any risk because it wasn't

922
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,019
weed it was just clothing

923
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,880
yeah so I wanted to show a picture too

924
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,920
of the F Wonder real quick this is a

925
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,720
picture this is from uh the Instagram

926
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,940
account F1 Durbin but this is exactly

927
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,338
what it looks like how it breeds

928
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,960
um it's very true to form on this a lot

929
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:09,358
of people question whether it's a real

930
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,159
cut or not it does exist it's existed

931
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,259
for a long time

932
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,259
um when we grew it it was heavily Merlot

933
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:20,880
wine but I'm not so good at smelling

934
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:23,040
like aniseed in these Terps and uh yeah

935
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,220
I mean I I think it's probably very easy

936
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,500
to to uh have that in there I know some

937
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:31,139
people smell Coca-Cola type Terps too

938
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,338
with that Merlot wine smell but yeah

939
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:33,838
this is it

940
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:35,759
um I I think it's not very well

941
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,838
documented so I wanted to sneak it in

942
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,640
here while we were still talking about

943
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:40,639
the uh predecessors

944
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,160
I think it it ties into

945
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,260
um like I said the multiple accidental

946
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:52,139
pollinations

947
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:55,020
you know uh that occurred

948
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:59,219
um and so the farther back you go in the

949
00:36:55,019 --> 00:37:00,900
cookie story uh the murkier it becomes

950
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,699
um there are certain things that that I

951
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,139
think we know for sure there are certain

952
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,659
things that are known that aren't very

953
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,338
well known right uh there's certain

954
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:10,980
things I might even dance around just

955
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:13,019
because they're stored like you know as

956
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,179
as any tale that involves a bunch of

957
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,559
friends over a long period of time you

958
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:18,299
know there's parts that are pertinent

959
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:19,739
and there's parts that

960
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,900
you know

961
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:24,299
um could ruffle some feathers I suppose

962
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,099
but yeah and there's stuff that you

963
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,800
think and that I I probably disagree

964
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:32,099
with you know like it in what's actually

965
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,320
in specific ones and specific things oh

966
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,480
I mean it'll be interesting about you

967
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,059
know we won't say what exactly but like

968
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,699
you know there was this week between CSI

969
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:44,699
Matt and myself there was debates going

970
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:47,039
back and forth on on lineage of certain

971
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:49,259
things yeah um and people that have been

972
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,599
Skeptics maybe even coming around to

973
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,000
certain theories yeah or being more open

974
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,859
to it because they they smelled certain

975
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,739
things or saw certain traits and they

976
00:37:55,858 --> 00:38:00,659
were like whoa you know and to me like I

977
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:01,739
I don't know why I don't why would you

978
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:03,598
want to dance around I think we don't

979
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,699
need to dance around it particularly on

980
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,619
this specific one because I think it

981
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:09,960
answers a lot of questions there's been

982
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,358
a lot of is it okay if I just enter in a

983
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,659
little bit I mean you know sure we can

984
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:17,699
you know go for it I suppose yeah I mean

985
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:21,000
because we're already going to do the um

986
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:22,679
the F12 reversal at csis and we're going

987
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,559
to answer a lot of questions with it at

988
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,779
least to get an idea of what happens

989
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,239
when you cross a the F1 derb and that

990
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:34,980
Florida OG or the Flow Rider

991
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:37,319
um or if you cross F1 derp and GDP

992
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,838
um looking at the F1 derb I I mean

993
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,480
growing it when I did I didn't I didn't

994
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:44,460
have a lot of insight into it uh I grew

995
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,338
it seeded it immediately lost it pretty

996
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,500
quick and I also didn't have the same

997
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:54,000
experience that I did that I do now

998
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:55,800
looking back when I was growing it and

999
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,099
one of the main question of cookies I

1000
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,260
think that that me you and CSI talk

1001
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:03,780
about is where is all the black and

1002
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,420
purple coming from I mean we know Urkel

1003
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,359
can kick purples and that's in in my

1004
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,700
opinion at least Urkel is the main main

1005
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,799
force behind cookies and the look The

1006
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:15,779
Shape a lot of it

1007
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,320
um but it's not really well known for

1008
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:22,200
consistently and and being a true

1009
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,720
breeding purple breeder

1010
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:28,559
um there's a lot of green coming out of

1011
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:31,019
purple or purple purple and GDP much the

1012
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,838
same but there is a consistent true

1013
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:35,579
breeding black trait in that line and

1014
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,039
and you know we had talked about deep

1015
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,599
Chunk we had talked about

1016
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,279
um maybe it is just circle maybe it's

1017
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,660
like this recessive shape being brought

1018
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,920
up and it's been slammed into each other

1019
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:46,019
enough that is just consistently

1020
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,358
bringing black now

1021
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,280
um or maybe Mendo perps

1022
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:53,219
you know and what we know about Mendo

1023
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,400
perps is it's it's it expresses a lot of

1024
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:58,679
different uh smells in the S ones one of

1025
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,119
those is heavy anise

1026
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,980
you know

1027
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,140
and that's always very interesting and I

1028
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,358
think uh the fact that it breeds true to

1029
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:08,338
Black in a lot of cases

1030
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:11,098
um is another interesting point to that

1031
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:14,338
what's your thoughts on it

1032
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:15,900
um I will admit that uh

1033
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:18,779
this is a little political or whatever

1034
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,180
but I will admit that um I did not

1035
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,960
believe for a long time

1036
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:26,759
uh some of the stuff Matt was saying uh

1037
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,980
in terms of not that I thought I was

1038
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,079
lying or anything like that I just I you

1039
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,960
know I just didn't I just didn't quite

1040
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,240
see it quite as much and then

1041
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,039
um you know different stuff starts

1042
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,659
coming to light in various aspects and

1043
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:42,300
you know things start bubbling up or

1044
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:46,679
whatever and uh

1045
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:51,780
and I I do tend to believe now that uh

1046
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:54,480
Mendo p is in there somewhere yeah I do

1047
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,440
um you know and it's simply because you

1048
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,659
know there's there's a lot of

1049
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,019
connections between like Mendo and our

1050
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:03,059
crew uh and those Bay Area cats in one

1051
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:04,858
way or another like I said I mean I have

1052
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:07,259
a long-running relationship back then

1053
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:09,779
with uh one of the guys

1054
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,000
um that we did a lot of exchanging of

1055
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,980
um we had a we had a cut called Anis

1056
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,440
that used to get pushed through the bay

1057
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,858
quite a bit and it was did you say the

1058
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,858
anus

1059
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:26,279
um which was which was uh which was a

1060
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,780
strangely which was a Mendo perps uh

1061
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,359
Durbin poison

1062
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,400
yeah interesting thing that we made that

1063
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:36,598
hurts yeah

1064
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,119
and so you know you know people should

1065
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,500
know that with anything like there's

1066
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,820
certain things that are that are

1067
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,980
speculation and there's certain things

1068
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,480
that I know for fact yeah right and so

1069
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,679
you want to always be clear about the

1070
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,858
two

1071
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:51,960
um I I tend to think that it's in there

1072
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:53,578
I tend to think not that it's in I don't

1073
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,920
think it got in there late I think it

1074
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:59,280
got in there early yeah

1075
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,099
you know uh it was an early contributor

1076
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,380
um and I do know something that's not

1077
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:06,599
particularly well known uh that I guess

1078
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,358
I could spouse or whatever

1079
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,220
um I know what the mother plant that

1080
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,380
cookies came out of was

1081
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:17,578
what's that

1082
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,740
um so the seeds that uh became thin mint

1083
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:23,700
right that I guess started the the

1084
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:26,279
cookie craze or or what have you right

1085
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:29,578
um they were grown by my friend

1086
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,859
and uh uh they were rolling up a joint

1087
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:34,320
in the bay uh one of my oldest friends

1088
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:37,559
was actually in the room with with these

1089
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,440
guys at the time and some seeds fell out

1090
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,858
of a cherry Kush Bud okay

1091
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,900
okay and those seeds uh [ __ ] ended up

1092
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:48,659
uh making thin mint

1093
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,700
so I wonder so Cherry cush now this is

1094
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:52,799
different than the Cherry Pie right yes

1095
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:55,858
so supposedly

1096
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,980
um Cherry Kush is

1097
00:42:55,858 --> 00:43:00,960
um cherry pie uh Herms onto the

1098
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,960
Flowrider gotcha

1099
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,659
right and see from that they called

1100
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,240
Cherry Kush that makes sense cherry pie

1101
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:11,879
is known to do that little cherry pie

1102
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:16,199
not only Herms uh cherry pie throws

1103
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,019
actual male full male pollen sacks like

1104
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:22,379
you would like live like not just

1105
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:25,259
bananas but actual it can pop full male

1106
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,599
flowers at times right yes it's a tricky

1107
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,280
one yeah

1108
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,940
um and

1109
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,640
um you know so so I know what the mom is

1110
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,858
you know yeah I and as a result of that

1111
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:39,779
I like I know what room it actually was

1112
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:41,338
it actually the the room was grown in

1113
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,019
Willits which is a little town in

1114
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:44,818
Mendocino County about 20 minutes north

1115
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:46,679
of me yeah

1116
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:47,880
um and it it came out of a relatively

1117
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:50,338
small room and there was only three

1118
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,059
things in the room and two of them were

1119
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:55,980
uh were uh Cherry Pie and and that and

1120
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:59,338
that kush cut

1121
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,318
uh the other one was Elvis oh strange I

1122
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:02,940
remember Elvis yeah the other one was

1123
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:04,139
Elvis there was only three things in

1124
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,480
there

1125
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:08,338
um and so we know what the mom was so

1126
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,440
they were rocking Elvis and they didn't

1127
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:12,719
use that they used all the suckers

1128
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,338
well it's not that they used yeah you're

1129
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,259
right you're right yeah it happened on

1130
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:18,119
there I think

1131
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,119
to be honest I think the first

1132
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,800
intentional cookie breeding like by them

1133
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,480
came when they started messing around

1134
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,859
with sherbert like when they started

1135
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,300
messing around

1136
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:33,960
you know in 2009 2010 2011 12 like that

1137
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,640
era yeah right I think before they

1138
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,960
didn't really know you know they didn't

1139
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,480
even have it

1140
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,980
right it was different people had it it

1141
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,179
was getting moved to different people

1142
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,039
it's not like certain people weren't

1143
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,318
smoking it or having it or whatever but

1144
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,300
it was like I think thin mint was sort

1145
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,420
of the basis for them to like take off

1146
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,260
with it yeah if you will

1147
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,740
um

1148
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:58,740
and uh and so you know I wish I could

1149
00:44:55,739 --> 00:45:00,479
actually see comments uh while I was I'm

1150
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:03,118
talking there are some people that are

1151
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,338
dropping some stuff that I wanna that I

1152
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,318
would like to speak on but

1153
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:10,559
um I have to toggle back and forth

1154
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:11,880
between uh Matt's beautiful face and uh

1155
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,799
you don't want to do that you don't want

1156
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,300
to miss seeing my face I know so that's

1157
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,099
why it's so hard for me to read comments

1158
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,839
so I apologize sometimes I'll see him if

1159
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,059
Matt pops them up because he pins them

1160
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:23,039
or something yeah it's um there's a lot

1161
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:25,559
of stuff about like always be flowering

1162
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,420
and flux and uh Frost boss and all those

1163
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:29,519
guys people just plug in names trying to

1164
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,519
guess it who's who

1165
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:35,699
um I mean all good names all good names

1166
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:37,199
I suppose I I don't know if uh you know

1167
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,059
there's a there's a part of me that

1168
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,460
wonders how specific to get on certain

1169
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:44,578
things and and what to stay like

1170
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,139
slightly mysterious on or whatever but

1171
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:48,480
um there was a couple names there was

1172
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:50,039
even a a dude's name that started with a

1173
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,960
c in there that was definitely involved

1174
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:56,480
on a certain level

1175
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:59,760
um but I know I'm I am 99.9 sure

1176
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,818
that uh what became thin mint came out

1177
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,339
of cherry cherry Kush so one thing I

1178
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:07,259
want to add here is um when it came to

1179
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:09,179
the forums when it came to Girl Scout

1180
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,680
cookies hitting the forums a lot of

1181
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:13,739
people are used to hearing the term

1182
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:16,379
Forum cut now when Girl Scout cookies

1183
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:18,299
hit the forums thin mint wasn't

1184
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,160
something being passed around or bandied

1185
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,200
about the name really wasn't something

1186
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,899
popping up yet

1187
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:26,519
um the first time we saw it was I

1188
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,660
believe it was always be flowering

1189
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:29,880
passing it

1190
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,379
to someone either directly to Lumpy's

1191
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,838
lump status or

1192
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,858
or to someone to lump status and that

1193
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,719
was the first time a lot of people

1194
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:38,940
really got a good look like a really

1195
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,980
good look at big blown up grows of

1196
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,599
cookies and they were some of the most

1197
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,400
beautiful and I do believe those are

1198
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,200
still up there on icy mag if anybody

1199
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,760
wants to go check them out um lump

1200
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,578
status has some beautiful pictures up

1201
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,839
there but yeah um The Forum cut was the

1202
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,940
one that

1203
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,039
the cut that became called form cut was

1204
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,780
the one that tended to circulate um then

1205
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:58,920
mint didn't start circulating until much

1206
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,540
later

1207
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,639
wanted to add that in there because a

1208
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:04,619
lot of people were asking about uh The

1209
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,980
Forum and when it came well yeah I mean

1210
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:11,700
we me and uh uh a homie of mine on this

1211
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:14,460
show all just called tuna uh tuna and I

1212
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:17,759
actually grew some of the first cookie

1213
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,679
um up in Mendocino uh because those guys

1214
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,780
were all stuck in like six and eight and

1215
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,539
ten lighters or whatever and they were

1216
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,900
trying to get uh they were trying to get

1217
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:30,420
uh obviously more of it at the time you

1218
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,119
know uh and they were so paranoid about

1219
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,740
anybody knowing what it was uh I think

1220
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,780
they made it I mean I think they made us

1221
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:38,219
call it girl I'd have to ask him uh

1222
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,260
gravity

1223
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:42,719
oh interesting because because they

1224
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,160
didn't want anybody on our scene any of

1225
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,338
our workers

1226
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:49,199
they made sure that like we could never

1227
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:51,779
talk to anybody that was on our farm

1228
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,939
about like this was special or this was

1229
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,859
new they were terrified of it getting

1230
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,420
out yeah

1231
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:00,179
um and so and they were pretty

1232
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,980
controlling on it for a long time so I'm

1233
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:03,659
not surprised that thin mint took a

1234
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,059
minute to get out

1235
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:08,940
um I think what Screwed cookie in that

1236
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:10,980
regard is that uh in cookie lines

1237
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,500
there's hermaphrodism

1238
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,539
then back seats get out

1239
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,818
and that's in a lot of ways that's how

1240
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:19,440
cookie kind of spread it first they were

1241
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:21,960
not passing it out to friends they were

1242
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,818
not sharing it they were not they had a

1243
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,159
thing that made a lot of money

1244
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:28,739
and was hyping and that was their Ticket

1245
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,000
to Ride and they didn't want to share it

1246
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,399
yeah

1247
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,960
you know so I'm not surprised that I'm

1248
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,660
not surprised that the real thin mint

1249
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,300
sort of took some time to bubble out

1250
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:40,500
right yeah uh because one of the things

1251
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,300
that's kind of funny one of the things

1252
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,119
that swore me off of cookies for a few

1253
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,980
years was we ran a couple big Greenies

1254
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:51,300
couple big depths of it

1255
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:52,440
uh and it freaking it harmed uh and

1256
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,060
seated

1257
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,420
and then they were devastated because

1258
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:59,099
they didn't want seeded weed to get out

1259
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:01,318
yeah right so they didn't want us to

1260
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,880
sell it so you can imagine how fun it is

1261
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:05,099
to have a couple greenhouses of weed

1262
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,720
that they don't want you to sell yeah it

1263
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:09,180
was kind of it was kind of before like

1264
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,639
the the modern hash era had sort of

1265
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:12,899
taken off again right so it wasn't like

1266
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:16,019
you could just be like oh we'll just

1267
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,720
wash it right that it really wasn't it

1268
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:20,219
really wasn't that era yet right

1269
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,779
um where there was like a like a whole

1270
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:23,159
bunch of hash like there was you know

1271
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,319
there was water hash and there was some

1272
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:27,358
BHO and there was Keith and stuff but it

1273
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:29,579
wasn't like all the

1274
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,920
the Modern Gear that people are used to

1275
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:33,440
yeah it wasn't like the secret cups

1276
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,760
blown it up quite yet I don't think

1277
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,858
there wasn't even like you know bang

1278
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,300
like you know that was like the if you

1279
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:41,880
were smoking it back then you were

1280
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,940
probably smoking a glowing Cherry Banger

1281
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,619
and dropping unpurged BHO into it or

1282
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,679
something like that you know yeah that's

1283
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:52,740
it wasn't it was it was the snap crackle

1284
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:56,159
and pop era you know uh there was uh it

1285
00:49:52,739 --> 00:50:00,239
was it was we're going to hell for the

1286
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:02,699
[ __ ] we made and sold as BH early on I

1287
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,979
have ignorance you know ignorance is it

1288
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,598
people didn't know at the time yeah I

1289
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,400
don't think you know people and you know

1290
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,099
and then we didn't have vacuum ovens and

1291
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,220
all that different types of stuff it was

1292
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:16,140
um coffee filter water bottle weed in it

1293
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:18,480
shoot [ __ ] I mean the worst thing was

1294
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:21,480
was was you know uh this is getting off

1295
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,880
tangent but like PVC tubes was the

1296
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,079
standard with uh with silk screen and

1297
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,460
then you would you know you would put a

1298
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:29,039
cap on it you would drill a hole through

1299
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:33,199
the cap and then you would like like pop

1300
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:35,279
um you know cans of butane through

1301
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,719
and yeah and then and then all of a

1302
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,880
sudden people discovered that like after

1303
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,799
you do that for a while the PVC isn't

1304
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,300
smooth anymore on the inside yeah no

1305
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,099
weird how that works

1306
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,720
so a little polyvinyl chloride or

1307
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:47,400
whatever into your mix

1308
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:48,959
but that's that I mean that's way off

1309
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,519
topic but

1310
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,760
um but I just mean in the sense that

1311
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:56,420
like uh I discovered uh pretty early on

1312
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,480
that cookie did not like food sunlight

1313
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:02,639
uh and was prone to hermaphrodism yeah

1314
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,639
you know and I think all the early cuts

1315
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,379
that got out were a lot of them were bag

1316
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:08,879
seed

1317
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,980
I would think so

1318
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,119
you know and then they got and then you

1319
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,400
know we're talking about form and then

1320
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:15,838
they got named I mean we see this with

1321
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,639
diesel like we've talked about this

1322
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,500
we've seen this with chem dog we've seen

1323
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:22,139
it with a bunch of stuff where we're

1324
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,880
just bag seed bag seed bag seed

1325
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:26,578
proliferates on cuts that are kind of

1326
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,700
held tight in little Cruise back seats

1327
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:31,079
start slowly proliferating you know I

1328
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:33,779
remember when this was happening with

1329
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:35,160
cookies uh the cookies crew kept

1330
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,720
referring to everything as fortune

1331
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:38,399
cookies like you're lucky you got that

1332
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,719
seed in that bag so it's fortune cookies

1333
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,760
that's not real cooking they're just

1334
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:45,179
fortune cookies that was the slander

1335
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,740
evolved non cookie fam approved cuts

1336
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:48,419
well yeah because it was one of those

1337
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:51,000
things where if it wasn't branded

1338
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,318
through them it wasn't them sure and

1339
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,239
they they certainly weren't going to

1340
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:57,058
admit that their stuff had gotten out

1341
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,199
either yeah you know and so there's a

1342
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,819
bunch of rumors we don't need it's not

1343
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:03,719
like I'm some expert where I can tell

1344
00:51:59,818 --> 00:52:05,940
you the origins of forum exactly or ogkb

1345
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:08,279
and how it exactly popped up and through

1346
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,019
where and how I mean there's a there's a

1347
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,700
lot of you know like a lot of these

1348
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:14,219
things there's a lot of circles involved

1349
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:16,439
you know small circles that can overlap

1350
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:18,719
at times you know and there was

1351
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,300
definitely circles and Mendo that had

1352
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,279
aspects going on with them and those you

1353
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,380
know and there was circles in the bay

1354
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,380
yeah and in some cases some of those

1355
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:32,400
people own places in both places

1356
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:34,079
the bay and by my area yeah you know

1357
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,700
um and so as a result of that you know I

1358
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,740
don't think I don't know if if most

1359
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:40,858
people ever heard of like what bud

1360
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:42,419
itself The Thin Mint was found in

1361
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:45,838
because I don't think they wanted to

1362
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,280
give up what the mom was yeah

1363
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:49,818
you know

1364
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,740
um but I'm night like I said I'm 99 sure

1365
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:55,920
that it came out of it came out of chair

1366
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:57,659
of cherry Kush what's funny yeah it

1367
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,400
makes sense and what's funny to me is

1368
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:01,858
like it's almost like that Old Dutch way

1369
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,200
of thinking where Neville would put his

1370
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:06,838
the lineage out because he was a breeder

1371
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:08,639
and he knew it would be even if you know

1372
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:11,338
what the parents are unless you had

1373
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,960
these exact clones

1374
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:14,639
you're still going to have a tough time

1375
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,619
making a line that represents the same

1376
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,940
exact line that I'm selling seeds of you

1377
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:19,500
know sure a lot of these other people

1378
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,000
they didn't they weren't as deep into

1379
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,460
breeding so they're thinking if you know

1380
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,818
my recipe you can make my my recipe you

1381
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,139
can make my food you know and yeah if

1382
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:31,079
you know what country if you know what

1383
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:33,000
cut the mom was you can get that cut and

1384
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:37,260
then you're halfway there maybe yeah

1385
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,980
maybe and then you've got the money yep

1386
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:44,339
yeah in all reality even if you grab two

1387
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:45,780
of the uh same cuts and reverse them if

1388
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:47,519
you're popping seeds the likelihood

1389
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,619
you're going to run into that same exact

1390
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,960
expression in your environments very low

1391
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:54,000
but that's you know that was years away

1392
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,099
from them figuring that [ __ ] out

1393
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,719
so I you know I know what buddy came out

1394
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:00,960
of I know what strains were in the room

1395
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:05,098
do I know if if it if that those seeds

1396
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:08,280
were from an S1 of that of that plant no

1397
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:10,920
do I know if it was the the Kush harmed

1398
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,540
onto that plant no you know do I know if

1399
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,180
the Elvis was involved I don't think it

1400
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:18,119
was but no you know but I know it's

1401
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:19,858
those three and I know what what butt it

1402
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:21,900
came out of yeah

1403
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:24,960
you know and I don't think and I don't

1404
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,660
even think amongst their initial crew

1405
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,940
um they spread it out very much like a

1406
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:31,679
[ __ ] didn't even tell the person it

1407
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,079
came from for over a year that he had

1408
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,118
found it

1409
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:38,160
but that's how it goes right that's how

1410
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,780
it goes yeah he didn't I I think it took

1411
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:43,139
so there's always been there's always

1412
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:46,619
been uh intentional opaque you know

1413
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:47,519
intent intentional you know uh fog if

1414
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:49,260
you will

1415
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:56,159
you know

1416
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:57,660
uh I mean so looking at cookies from a a

1417
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,399
just a purely and when I talk about

1418
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:01,199
cookies I'm going to talk about not

1419
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,240
necessarily the The Thin Mint because I

1420
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,338
don't think most people like I know it's

1421
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:08,459
out there people have it yes you know

1422
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:10,139
but most people experience The Forum uh

1423
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:12,539
in general so when I want to talk about

1424
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:14,699
cookies most people when they think of

1425
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:17,460
cookies think of the Forum cut

1426
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:21,239
and when we look at that from a breeding

1427
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:23,039
aspect what I tend to see in it is

1428
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:25,858
purple Urkle

1429
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,659
and OG Kush and the reason that I tend

1430
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:30,119
to see this is because out of doing

1431
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:32,940
myself having made several different OG

1432
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:36,838
kush and purple Urkle hybrids and OG

1433
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:40,338
Kush GDP having run a bunch and what I'd

1434
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:40,338
seen was this constant

1435
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:46,260
right around the Cookie's expression

1436
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:49,019
showing up these small yielding cushy

1437
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,599
looking purple things you know slightly

1438
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:52,980
gassy sometimes more grape honestly a

1439
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,420
lot of times when I'd see something look

1440
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,338
more close to cookies it would be more

1441
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,519
grapey but finding one that looked like

1442
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:01,619
that with gas was really really unique

1443
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:03,239
but to me for a long time that's what I

1444
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:06,358
thought the recipe was that was it

1445
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:08,519
that's all you ever needed but I do

1446
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:10,679
think I do think Mendo perps comes into

1447
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:12,780
play heavily you know

1448
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:14,598
um well I mean if I if I had to make

1449
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,359
like a uh

1450
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:22,740
like an educated guess I suppose of what

1451
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:25,799
maybe happened is you know I think that

1452
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:27,500
you know it's almost like parallel lines

1453
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,240
that come back together

1454
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,739
right so you have a situation where

1455
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:36,539
maybe maybe you've got something like um

1456
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:39,118
uh maybe you've got something like F1

1457
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:41,579
derb yeah okay whatever they say that is

1458
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:47,818
and that thing Herms onto that thing

1459
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:49,680
Herms onto uh uh kush yeah right

1460
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:51,719
um and that's a plan and then you know

1461
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:54,299
you've got F1 derb and that Herms onto

1462
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:58,078
GDP or or something close to that right

1463
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,818
or Urkel and and you've got cherry pie

1464
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,660
right

1465
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:03,539
um

1466
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:06,659
and then that thing Herms on to that

1467
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:10,139
thing Herms on to cush again

1468
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:13,739
right and now you've got Cherry Kush

1469
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:16,259
yeah and then something Herms again and

1470
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:19,199
puts seeds in Cherry Kush and now you've

1471
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:21,780
got cherry and now you've got

1472
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:25,399
possible thin mint you know what else

1473
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,400
you have nail time

1474
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:33,058
we got some video types homie yeah I I

1475
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:35,460
mangle the English language so I have a

1476
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:38,460
hard time specifically on nailing [ __ ]

1477
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,980
on that one so bad but

1478
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,838
um you know but I I think that I think

1479
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,599
that all those cats were determined to

1480
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:48,539
be famous yeah and they saw their movie

1481
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,220
and they took with it and then all these

1482
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:51,719
questions that come out and people want

1483
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:53,519
to be like okay so have you been in your

1484
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,219
basement for the last 15 years making

1485
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,900
this yeah and they certainly didn't want

1486
00:57:56,219 --> 00:57:59,219
to be like well we stumbled upon it at

1487
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,660
the very end

1488
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:02,159
and we were getting different things

1489
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:03,659
from different friends and friends were

1490
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:04,739
growing it and we were moving weed and

1491
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:06,960
this was happening and that was

1492
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:07,739
happening and then I got the seed seeded

1493
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,280
bud

1494
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:14,039
yeah and so I'm we're a cookie fam

1495
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,880
yeah yeah that's a that's a nice way to

1496
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:20,039
end that statement right and boom here

1497
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,660
we go you know and so so I mean I'm just

1498
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,058
even trying to be fair to them like sure

1499
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:25,679
their mission was to like build you know

1500
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:27,359
they had an idea that they could build a

1501
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,980
brand and they could get famous and they

1502
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:31,380
could you know sell a lot of weed

1503
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,900
especially probably in the beginning it

1504
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:36,180
was wow if we control this we can get

1505
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:39,119
crazy dollar at all these clubs on the

1506
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,500
top shelf yeah so let's produce as much

1507
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:45,059
of it as we can

1508
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:47,338
right and get top dollar everywhere yeah

1509
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:49,500
I think that's really how it started and

1510
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:52,078
then The Branding aspect came along and

1511
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,338
IG and this came along and these

1512
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,818
different things started happening and

1513
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:58,798
they started to realize that maybe there

1514
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:00,480
was maybe with the way things were

1515
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:02,579
heading and legalization and all that

1516
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,460
like maybe they could become famous yeah

1517
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:07,200
maybe they could become rich off it

1518
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:10,380
you know

1519
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,899
um and you know so obviously like burner

1520
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,880
and [ __ ] are well known uh sherb is

1521
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,380
pretty well known

1522
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,358
um you know but there's a couple other

1523
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,160
people uh that aren't very well known

1524
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:21,480
that probably had more to do with it

1525
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,000
than anything at least in the beginning

1526
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,260
yeah right

1527
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,239
um but they didn't want their faces to

1528
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,380
be shown

1529
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:29,939
um maybe because they were Bay Area

1530
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,920
Hustlers at the time

1531
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,900
yeah and they didn't want they didn't

1532
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,940
you know and and you know I I've said

1533
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:39,298
this before on on the cast too it's like

1534
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:41,940
it's a very different skill set from the

1535
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:44,219
90s through the 2000s

1536
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,318
um of staying under underground and

1537
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:49,798
staying with your face not visible and

1538
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:51,719
staying safe and then flipping into I'm

1539
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,338
gonna create a cult of personality I'm

1540
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:57,058
going to be famous everyone's going to

1541
00:59:53,338 --> 00:59:59,159
know my face associated with weed yeah

1542
00:59:57,059 --> 01:00:01,200
that was a big transition

1543
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:04,139
and it turns out that the people that

1544
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:06,058
wanted to stay uh secret aren't very

1545
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:07,679
well known and the people that wanted to

1546
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:09,960
stick their face over everything and

1547
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,699
talk and be at all the events are

1548
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,420
household names in the weed Community

1549
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:17,460
yeah however you want to say that you

1550
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:19,700
know but I mean that's how it goes in

1551
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:22,500
any business not just weed it's any like

1552
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:25,618
the the front man's always going to be

1553
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:28,318
the one that that gets the shine it just

1554
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:30,298
is what it is

1555
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:33,599
I mean you know it's but it's it's

1556
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:35,519
different in weed because I think uh you

1557
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:39,480
know there's a part of it where

1558
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:41,338
there was risk involved yeah and and you

1559
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,960
know when I and when I say Hustler it's

1560
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:45,179
like that you know they

1561
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,318
there was a lot of gray area then

1562
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:49,199
yeah

1563
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,818
so you know people were in intently not

1564
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:53,039
trying to get in trouble

1565
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:54,599
yeah you know and so some people took

1566
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,338
that route and some people took the fame

1567
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,079
route and you know I think when they

1568
01:00:56,338 --> 01:00:59,279
started you know they started trying to

1569
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,220
breed with it

1570
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,140
like basically based off the fact that

1571
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:06,239
they had this one cut and now they were

1572
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:07,500
famous yeah and some people took the

1573
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:10,618
route where they tell on the black

1574
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:13,139
market people at local business meetings

1575
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:15,420
um so we haven't gotten to gelato or

1576
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:17,699
Sunset sherbet yet do you want to touch

1577
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:20,400
on those

1578
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:22,078
we can touch on the sherb I suppose well

1579
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,639
I mean I think

1580
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,079
um yeah we'll start with sure let's

1581
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:26,818
start with sure I mean that happened

1582
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:28,798
first right yeah yeah

1583
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:31,858
anyway

1584
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:34,679
um so sure supposedly

1585
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:36,960
um by the I I didn't get to ask

1586
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:39,058
sherbinsky himself what sure what Sunset

1587
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,380
sherbet is he said it was made in his

1588
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:42,720
garage

1589
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:46,140

1590
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:48,598
um no it was it was made uh The District

1591

in San Francisco that he lived in is

1592
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,780
called the sunset district oh maybe

1593
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,940
that's what he meant by Sunset yeah

1594
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:55,980
because that was my bad it's called if

1595

1598
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:05,818
neighborhood you know that would be why

I remember when I first got it I was

1623
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:00,599
really stoked just to kind of get a good

1624
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,139
idea of what it looked like and it

1625
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:07,039
reminded me a lot of a um a lower resin

1626
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:07,039
blackberry kush

1627
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,200
yeah it's not that that does not sound I

1628
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,760
had better Terps it had better chirps in

1629
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:16,798
blackberry kush it's not like a total

1630
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,960
knock on it I see why someone would have

1631
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:21,539
used it for for the Terps but it it

1632
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,380
wasn't super resinous

1633
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:24,539
um

1634
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,880
didn't have a great bud structure it

1635
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:28,980
wasn't super dense it was pretty it was

1636
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,140
purple and it had a great pink stock

1637
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,760
like pink stripe stock with purple

1638
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:34,500
stripes down it was really pretty that

1639
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,000
way in veg

1640
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,760
um but I believe that's what's supposed

1641
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,159
to be half a sunset sure

1642
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,619
if I'm correct

1643
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:45,659
um and the other half

1644
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,220
I don't remember does anybody else

1645
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:50,460
remember do you remember

1646
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:52,078
yeah I mean it I I think you know I mean

1647
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,699
I think they've acknowledged that it's

1648
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,099
like I think it's they they say it's

1649
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:57,779
that cross to thin mint that's what I

1650
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:59,338
that's right tin mint and pink panties

1651
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:02,720
yeah because it's all because it's like

1652
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:07,440
they cookies never never really varied

1653
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:10,739
very far from the uh from the the root

1654
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,119
yeah you know uh they they didn't I mean

1655
01:04:10,739 --> 01:04:13,558
that's part of the issue too is it's

1656
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:15,539
it's not really they have like a family

1657
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,780
or a line they had they started with a

1658
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:20,400
couple of cuts yeah you know

1659
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:23,460
um I mean like even like gelato right

1660
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,619
gelato is is you know sherbet back to

1661
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,980
thin mint yes

1662
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:32,220
right I believe so he said uh made by

1663
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,960
reversing Sherbert hitting the GSC and

1664
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:35,699
and he said that originally they were

1665
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,720
trying to reverse

1666
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:43,199
thin mint onto sherb but that failed

1667
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:45,358
so sure on to thin mint worked so they

1668
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:48,480
said they tried it two different ways

1669
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,578
did he say if he were did he say he

1670
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,039
reversed Sherbert or did he say they had

1671
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:55,940
a sherbet yes he said reverse Sherbert

1672
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,500
yes reversed sherbert

1673
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,960
intentional reversal of sherbert and um

1674
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:03,659
some in in you know like in a typical La

1675
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,159
garage blown it up type thing like I've

1676
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:07,440
always done no I was done like I said it

1677
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:08,338
was it was I I mean I believe them in

1678
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,179
the sense

1679
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:14,940
in in the sense that uh uh sherbinsky

1680
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:18,000
had a six slider in the in the um in the

1681
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:19,200
sunset District right and [ __ ] and

1682
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,719
various people they were they were

1683
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:23,818
looking for places to do breeding okay

1684
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:25,858
they were looking for places to like

1685
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:27,539
okay so they have this cookies thing

1686
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:30,058
right there's a bunch of demand they're

1687
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:31,440
getting a bunch of loot from selling it

1688
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,599
all over to these dispensaries and

1689
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,039
everything else and they wanted to take

1690
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,420
it in different places and start

1691
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,739
creating seeds because seeds was

1692
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,318
starting to be booming business right

1693
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:41,279
yeah and so they worked out a deal I

1694
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,279
don't know exactly know what it was

1695
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,440
where they brought in sherb and they

1696
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,720
brought all the cuts over there and they

1697
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,780
start and they used his

1698
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:55,798
um his garage for a few times yeah

1699
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:58,680
and because it happened at his house

1700
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:01,139
um all of a sudden he's sherbinsky

1701
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:03,118
you know I will say he was the he was

1702
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:05,400
the one person out of everyone because I

1703
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,900
hit up everyone for this show to see if

1704
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,519
they wanted to leave any comments or

1705
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,720
they'd respond about different genetics

1706
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:13,440
he was the only one that was nice enough

1707
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:14,759
to respond and and um no no I just

1708
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,318
wanted to say it for everyone watching

1709
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,540
he was the only one out of those dudes

1710
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:20,880
that was nice enough to respond so take

1711
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:21,719
that for what it is I I appreciated that

1712
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,760
part

1713
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:25,199
you know but I do I you know I think he

1714
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,059
had I mean I think even on like his

1715
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,399
Instagram stories or whatever he's like

1716
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:31,200
gone to the the sunset district and like

1717
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,079
pointed out the house that it started oh

1718
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,818
yeah yeah you know type of thing he you

1719
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,960
know he had a sick he had a six maybe a

1720
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:39,179
six or an eight lighter or something

1721
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,980
like that in the sunset

1722
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:43,379
um and you know and he he was buddies

1723
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:45,179
with those guys and so they you know

1724
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,880
they started doing some breeding work

1725
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:49,739
over there yeah right so obviously they

1726
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,200
have a collab or a partnership going or

1727
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:55,618
whatever else and out of that collab and

1728
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:57,659
partnership eventually came uh sherbert

1729
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:59,280
uh which they named Sunset Sherbert

1730
01:06:57,659 --> 01:07:01,199
because of the region of San Francisco

1731
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,780
it came out of so it has another Bay

1732
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:05,519
tie-in right I always wondered that now

1733
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,200
it makes way more sense with the sunset

1734
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:08,940
yeah because you're not from here you're

1735
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:12,179
not you're yeah from down in in

1736
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:15,059
California desert hell yeah um but yeah

1737
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:16,919
yeah the Sun the sunset is the sunset is

1738
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,359
a beautiful District uh beautiful

1739
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:21,119
neighborhood

1740
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:23,279
um in the in San Francisco

1741
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,920
um and it was I don't want to say it was

1742
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,539
affordable then but it was one of the it

1743
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,818
was one of the neighborhoods that you

1744
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:31,380
could actually kind of like live in and

1745
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:32,699
get away with something like that for a

1746
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,220
bit Yeah like there's some really

1747
01:07:32,699 --> 01:07:37,439
wealthy neighborhoods in SF and there's

1748
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:38,818
some really crappy ones that one was

1749
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,200
like a decent one you know and it

1750
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:42,659
borders the you know it goes all the way

1751
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:45,179
to the ocean and stuff like that

1752
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:49,199
um and so it's a cool spot

1753
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:52,440
and uh they um you know there's so yeah

1754
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,899
again I think much like the second wave

1755
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:57,358
in Amsterdam like

1756
01:07:54,900 --> 01:08:00,180
um like serious seeds and Luke from

1757
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:02,818
Paradise and those guys uh we you know

1758
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:04,078
where like even 25 30 years later they

1759
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:05,099
still don't want to give you lineage

1760
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,380
hints

1761
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:09,720
you know yeah I don't think strabinsky

1762
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,818
or [ __ ] or any of those guys really

1763
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:14,399
wants to give out exactly what the

1764
01:08:11,818 --> 01:08:16,679
secret sauce is okay because I don't

1765
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,899
think it benefits them like they're not

1766
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:21,838
like they don't take that aspect they

1767
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:23,939
take the much more modern aspect of Hyde

1768
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,738
how you did it to some degree

1769
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:28,500
right because they don't want anyone out

1770
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:31,559
there making reproductions yeah or

1771
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:34,140
trying to find the plants that they used

1772
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,539
um and so you know and and as as a

1773
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:38,819
result of that obviously like the rename

1774
01:08:36,539 --> 01:08:40,920
game is strong

1775
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:43,859
which is pervasive throughout cannabis

1776
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,539
so that thing that you I never saw

1777
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:47,400
Burmese Kush

1778
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:48,659
yeah

1779
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,920
you know

1780
01:08:48,659 --> 01:08:51,960
um not that that doesn't mean it doesn't

1781
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,759
exist or anything like that but it was

1782
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,819
it was an Adam Dunn thing that was real

1783
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,859
popular for a while as anyone does any

1784
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:02,640
of your friends you've you've seen it

1785
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:04,859
yeah buku yeah is popular yeah it's

1786
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,480
popular yeah it was really popular

1787
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:08,940
during that time especially in Colorado

1788
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:11,039
and and stuff like that but yeah it was

1789
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:13,079
one of the early OG Kush crosses that

1790
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,539
that people could get like MK Ultra and

1791
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:16,738
Burmese Kush so that's why people were

1792
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:18,659
running it I think that's why people

1793
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:20,099
were running it back then yeah because

1794
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:22,679
it was one of the few you could get that

1795
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:25,199
supposedly had OG Kush in it Goji Kush

1796
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:27,440
in it yeah I mean as far as I know I

1797
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:29,818
could be wrong I do think that the the

1798
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:33,298
primary Kush and all these cookie things

1799
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:34,980
is that is that OG Is That Flow that

1800
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:37,500
flow cut because that's the one that

1801
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:39,238
they had that was their house and they

1802
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,738
had it years before you know they had it

1803
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:42,298
years before that the whole cookie thing

1804
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:47,278
even started it was kind of like their

1805
01:09:42,298 --> 01:09:48,838
thing you know it's really nice yeah so

1806
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,660
um and I've heard you know I don't know

1807
01:09:48,838 --> 01:09:54,119
if I want to even speak you know maybe

1808
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:56,159
um it would be it would be best if it

1809
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:57,659
came from sure probably I've definitely

1810
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,219
heard some different things over the

1811
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:01,619
years as to like what could have been

1812
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:03,420
involved in sherbert

1813
01:10:01,619 --> 01:10:05,399
um I've even heard that Sherbert in the

1814
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:08,060
beginning was a regular line

1815
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:10,319
interesting yeah

1816
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:13,400
that there was that there was that there

1817
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,399
was male sherberts

1818
01:10:13,819 --> 01:10:17,819
there was there was maybe some male

1819
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,679
sherbs at first and I do think so if you

1820
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:22,319
reverse some things maybe they picked

1821
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:26,039
like an exceptional female yeah

1822
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:27,420
and chose to take that one to back to

1823
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:29,219
the thin mint again

1824
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,619
yeah you know when they when they wanted

1825
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:33,300
to make gelato or whatever but

1826
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:35,460
um I think he's probably more famous for

1827
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,619
gelato now than he is for

1828
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:40,380
sure yeah I would think even though his

1829
01:10:37,619 --> 01:10:42,899
name is I think the gelatos kind of like

1830
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:45,420
were a wave and you know there was

1831
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:47,579
probably half a dozen phinos

1832
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:50,880
um from you know that that they made

1833
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:56,420
popular yeah from kind of like one batch

1834
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:59,640
of seed right yeah 45 41 42

1835
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:01,319
33 you know I think oh here here you go

1836
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,480
I think you plant seeds who numbered

1837
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:05,519
exceed one through 300 or one through

1838
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:08,279
twenty hear it one through eighty well

1839
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,120
we did about I think only like 19 didn't

1840
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:12,119
work

1841
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:13,859
no it worked well did it like yeah I was

1842
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:17,880
hearing it I couldn't hear it this time

1843
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:20,099
oh I was 15 seeds on this final hunt and

1844
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,800
the number 20 was just popping

1845
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:25,140
when you plant seeds at the end the 20

1846
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,520
was just popping yeah

1847
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,960
um I'm not sure if that I think that was

1848
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,020
related to like Blanco or something

1849
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:33,899
later on but yeah that's always a good

1850
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,820
quote to bring yeah I mean you know uh I

1851
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:37,559
don't I don't think you know I don't

1852
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:41,039
think Berner has ever grown

1853
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:42,900
yeah I doubt it I I remember some of the

1854
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,519
the early days at the cookie Collective

1855
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:46,198
when they started popping those up and

1856
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,699
people would take pictures of like the

1857
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:49,198
plants in the windows because they'd put

1858
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:52,019
like display clones in the windows and

1859
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:54,119
they'd just be covered in pm and it's

1860
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,340
like dude if if this dude was a grower

1861
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:59,698
he should be able to spot that I mean I

1862
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:01,560
get his Bud tenders weren't you know but

1863
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:04,619
dude have you ever been here you know I

1864
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:07,860
I don't mean this to be like a a diss at

1865
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:09,719
all on Burner specifically I just I I

1866
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:11,158
mean I I just mean in the sense that

1867
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:12,539
well because I'm not gonna diss somebody

1868
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:16,198
that doesn't grow

1869
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:17,819
yeah you know that pretends yeah sure

1870
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:20,759
but you know I don't think I don't even

1871
01:12:17,819 --> 01:12:23,158
know you know I think I think Berner is

1872
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,020
out there to be a hype man burner's out

1873
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:28,319
there to promote a brand and he's done a

1874
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:30,960
really he's he certainly is you know uh

1875
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:33,238
promoted it well yes he has it's well

1876
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,219
known he is good at that there's not too

1877
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:37,500
many corners of the weed world that

1878
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:39,140
don't know about cookies yeah I mean

1879
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,939
what they know about cookies might vary

1880
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:44,400
that's very true yeah but but the fact

1881
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:45,658
but you know they uh

1882
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:47,939
um you know and right now they're trying

1883
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:49,139
to be like a multi-state organization or

1884
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:50,399
whatever and

1885
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:53,340
um and they're trying to be a clothing

1886
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:55,979
brand and a weed store brand and I think

1887
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:58,679
like the cookies brand is as far move

1888
01:12:55,979 --> 01:13:00,658
beyond what our interest is is oh yeah

1889
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:02,340
which is the genetic I don't think you

1890
01:13:00,658 --> 01:13:05,099
know they're

1891
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,440
um you know uh our interest is mostly on

1892
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:11,640
this show is obviously genetics plant

1893
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:13,198
makeup how plants breed how plants smoke

1894
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,780
um all that type of stuff I will say

1895
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:17,939
personally my word we're halfway through

1896
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:21,599
the show or whatever but

1897
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:24,238
um I am not that big a fan of cookie and

1898
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,440
and cookie genetics to be honest I mean

1899
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:27,178
we've been talking about it for a while

1900
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:29,399
or whatever but

1901
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:31,560
um if I had a jar of a bunch of famous

1902
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:32,879
things you know

1903
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,699
um cookies is not what I would be

1904
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:39,179
reaching for very often no yeah if I had

1905
01:13:35,698 --> 01:13:41,339
a jar of 15 things cookies would not be

1906
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:43,739
in the top 15 of everythings I've smoked

1907
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,179
nothing cookies there's been cool unique

1908
01:13:43,738 --> 01:13:48,000
stuff I've been able to do with it that

1909
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:49,739
I kind of like like the the the uh the

1910
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,260
cookie Berry diesel that ended up being

1911
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:53,399
the the blue cookies cut I loved that

1912
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,260
one

1913
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:57,299
um but it's few and far between where

1914
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:59,460
I'm like wow this is good enough to

1915
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,079
really say it's super super unique and

1916
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:03,179
worth carrying on when it comes to

1917
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:05,519
cookie stuff

1918
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:07,380
uh yeah I mean I and that's just like

1919
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,199
that's just my personal opinion really

1920
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:12,000
like it's it's not like but I just find

1921
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:14,939
that like I really like weed that burns

1922
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,800
well uh a lot of cookies is like too to

1923
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:19,559
me it's too dense to like burn that

1924
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,140
great yeah um and I think that in the

1925
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,940
looks I think that cookies suffered from

1926
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:26,219
people making mistakes not knowing what

1927
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:28,619
they were doing early on and I think

1928
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:31,079
they lost the high

1929
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:33,599
yeah I mean one of the reasons I think

1930
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:36,359
ogkb became so famous even though it's

1931
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,280
like a mutant grows like an inch a month

1932
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:41,158
you know it's a huge pain in the ass but

1933
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:43,380
it actually worked yeah it was one of

1934
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:45,000
the few cookies lines you know as far as

1935
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:47,340
like cookies goes I think the ones that

1936
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,760
actually get you stoned are maybe like

1937
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:52,440
OG KB and and real animal cookies yeah

1938
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,539
yeah that's what I know but I think the

1939
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:57,539
real animal cookies gets its buzz from

1940
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:59,640
the kush yeah it's it's mostly OG Kush

1941
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:02,219
anyways it's mostly it's it's like

1942
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,659
mostly OG Kush with like some you know

1943
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:07,800
some other elements to it or whatever

1944
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:09,839
and uh but I think a lot to me a lot of

1945
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,659
cookie plants and a lot of cookie

1946
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:15,000
hybrids and a lot of sherb and all that

1947
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:16,319
um the high isn't particularly unique or

1948
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,300
potent

1949
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,279
um and it doesn't last that long

1950
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:23,699
I don't know what I don't know what huh

1951
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:28,439
I got something for you sure I want you

1952
01:15:23,698 --> 01:15:31,198
to create a line I want you to create

1953
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:35,039
a line that's truly unique in your mind

1954
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:37,439
but you have to use cookies

1955
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:40,439
you want to make the ultimate special

1956
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:43,919
unique cookies line you have anything at

1957
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:47,339
your disposal in the Clone world

1958
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,899
what are you gonna choose

1959
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:51,360
um

1960
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:52,738
well

1961
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:55,139
and if you're trying to make something

1962
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:58,319
unique off cookies

1963
01:15:55,140 --> 01:16:00,600
um when I look at plants I I look at

1964
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:01,619
there's very few plants to me that have

1965
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,440
it all

1966
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:06,899
yeah right uh that in that regard and

1967
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:08,879
what I mean by that in terms of like you

1968
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:12,238
know every every good trait you can

1969
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:15,420
think of from structure to Bud size to

1970
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:17,218
resin content to buzz to flavor to it

1971
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:20,279
doesn't mold or it doesn't hurt there's

1972
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:22,679
all these classifications right yeah and

1973
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:24,420
so when you're breeding you're kind of

1974
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:26,460
like well

1975
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,079
I'm going to look at what do I like

1976
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:31,739
about this plant

1977
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:34,439
and what is it missing yeah right and

1978
01:16:31,738 --> 01:16:36,419
and so maybe so with cookies I'd look at

1979
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:38,879
cookies and I'd be like well it grows

1980
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:40,260
like [ __ ] uh it doesn't like food or

1981
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:44,219
sunlight

1982
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:46,860
um and it doesn't get me that high right

1983
01:16:44,219 --> 01:16:49,260
um but it has a bunch of cool smells it

1984
01:16:46,859 --> 01:16:51,000
certainly has a bunch of cool Hues of

1985
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:53,579
purple and different types of stuff that

1986
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,619
can pop out in it it's bud structure is

1987
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:57,238
pretty nice

1988
01:16:55,619 --> 01:16:59,340
um so I would try to breed it with

1989
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:00,658
something that would give it from a

1990
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:03,119
production standpoint although this

1991
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:05,279
wouldn't be very necessary as far as a

1992
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,439
smoker goes but from like a Grower's

1993
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:09,238
perspective you would probably want to

1994
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:12,359
breed it with something that would give

1995
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:13,979
it some stretch and some Vigor yeah

1996
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:16,619
right where it could handle a little bit

1997
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:17,419
more food and handle a little bit more

1998
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:20,519
light

1999
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:22,859
uh and but from a from a consumption

2000
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:24,480
perspective I would be looking to cross

2001
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:25,698
it with the most potent thing I could

2002
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:29,339
think of

2003
01:17:25,698 --> 01:17:32,099
uh that wouldn't [ __ ] up its overall

2004
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:34,039
structure okay right

2005
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:36,659
um

2006
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:38,158
well you know in the sense of like I

2007
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:40,799
wouldn't necessarily like cross it like

2008
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,299
with a Neville's Haze yeah yeah

2009
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,800
you know

2010
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:46,199
um although I suppose that could work

2011
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,119
but like it it it would it would

2012
01:17:46,198 --> 01:17:49,319
probably mess up the the qualities that

2013
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:51,300
cookie has

2014
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:52,738
right

2015
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:55,320
um so I'd be looking for something that

2016
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:57,119
like packed a rare punch like

2017
01:17:55,319 --> 01:17:59,219
um like the uh if you wanted to stay

2018
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,198
cushy you could do that 56 day headband

2019
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:03,600
you could throw it on some you could

2020
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:05,519
throw it on some chem D

2021
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,800
um which is you know which is which is

2022
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:11,040
pretty and super potent but I would be

2023
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,960
looking to inject potency in it like the

2024
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:13,859
GMO that's a good good direction that

2025
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,279
we've seen

2026
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:20,759
yeah yeah exactly uh chemd I mean that's

2027
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:22,920
that's obviously chemd by Cookie right I

2028
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,239
mean yeah we at least a chemd expression

2029
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,920
by cookies I don't know if they had

2030
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:27,539
chemd in Spain

2031
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,679
you know whatever whatever the case may

2032
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:31,140
be yeah yeah

2033
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:32,520
um it it uh you know that's that's kind

2034
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,560
of what you're looking for right you're

2035
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,360
looking to add some potency to it yeah

2036
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,360
right and obviously like if that is the

2037
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:41,519
case and they did use G uh chemd or a

2038
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:44,339
derivative of it uh GMO got pretty

2039
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,600
famous yeah it did I mean it even got

2040
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:48,840
famous in the sense it did something

2041
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:51,900
that I think is super rare which is it

2042
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:55,199
got famous as a cut that takes 12 weeks

2043
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:58,019
yeah it did yeah and that is rare and in

2044
01:18:55,198 --> 01:19:00,719
my opinion anything in the 12 to 16 week

2045
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:02,880
range it's really really hard to get

2046
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,520
famous because it's longer running than

2047
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,500
most people want to go yeah

2048
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,600
you know and I think people were willing

2049
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:12,420
to run GMO for that long because it

2050
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,219
dumped they it yielded like crazy and

2051
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:16,260
especially when it came to Hash yields

2052
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:19,198
and washing and stuff like that it

2053
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:20,760
dumped really high yeah so it made those

2054
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:23,178
extra three or four weeks really

2055
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,179
valuable

2056
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,060
but I would be looking to add potency to

2057
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:29,159
cookie personally

2058
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:32,159
and then as a secondary measure I would

2059
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:33,539
try to make it not grow like [ __ ] that's

2060
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:36,059
a good measure

2061
01:19:33,539 --> 01:19:38,698
I mean you know growing in Mendo

2062
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:41,820
um you know uh it it kind of hates the

2063
01:19:38,698 --> 01:19:45,000
Sun yeah I wish I swear to God in the

2064
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:48,599
gorilla days I wish I had cookie then

2065
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,698
cookie would have done amazing in like

2066
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:53,340
Manzanita patches

2067
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:54,539
and on the edge of forest yeah yeah I

2068
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:57,119
could see it would have really done good

2069
01:19:54,539 --> 01:20:00,420
because it's dense it doesn't it does

2070
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:02,460
well in low light conditions you know I

2071
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:04,500
knew people early on in cookie days that

2072
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:06,179
would grow one strain directly

2073
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,880
underneath the light and cookie all the

2074
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:10,619
way around it on the edges oh wow and

2075
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,840
they would get really big yields per

2076
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:14,819
light off that way interesting because

2077
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:17,279
they'd get a decent yield off like the

2078
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:18,719
bright parts and then the other aspects

2079
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:20,340
that were a little like shaded or

2080
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,739
whatever that were on the outskirts the

2081
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:24,239
cookie yielded just fine if people are

2082
01:20:22,738 --> 01:20:26,039
taking shots with aspect today they're

2083
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:27,079
gonna die

2084
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:30,658
um

2085
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:33,899
so I was thinking because I I remember

2086
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:35,819
seeing uh Tom Hills Hayes cross to the

2087
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:39,179
Deep junk that he did and it actually

2088
01:20:35,819 --> 01:20:42,719
ended up looking like cookies

2089
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:46,260
so that Haze of his cross to cookies

2090
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:48,060
might actually be really interesting and

2091
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:50,460
keep a lot of the beautiful form that

2092
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:53,219
cookies has

2093
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,719
well I don't know only he would really

2094
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:56,100
know after after doing a bunch of

2095
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,679
crosses with it if you could keep some

2096
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,480
of the high from that Haze in there I

2097
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:03,179
mean I'm a huge Haze head don't get me

2098
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:06,119
wrong the reason why I eliminated it is

2099
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:08,819
because it adds this jungle element

2100
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:11,099
does and you could probably find

2101
01:21:08,819 --> 01:21:13,319
something that you really liked but

2102
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:15,360
you'd better be willing to look yeah

2103
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:17,340
that's the thing with Hayes right you

2104
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:19,920
have to dig you have to look and so

2105
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:22,619
that's a more complicated subject in

2106
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,600
terms of uh but yeah in terms of in

2107
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:27,119
terms of haze you're looking for things

2108
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:29,699
that make the bud nicer make it shorter

2109
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:31,920
make it take not as long

2110
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:33,960
yeah but still keep some of those Buzz

2111
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:36,239
elements that you're after

2112
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,819
the only other thing I would probably go

2113
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,559
after would be Appalachia just because I

2114
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:44,399
I still think that's probably one of the

2115
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:46,320
fastest best uh lines out there right

2116
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,939
now for hybridizing I think that would

2117
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:51,658
be I don't know if it would necessarily

2118
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:53,819
go super unique necessarily though

2119
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:55,379
um that is so funny dude there is this

2120
01:21:53,819 --> 01:21:57,000
thing I've been looking in the comments

2121
01:21:55,380 --> 01:22:01,140
and I was like I should hit up this guy

2122
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:03,000
J cash and ask him to message me and

2123
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:05,520
it's [ __ ] Tom you didn't know that

2124
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,238
the whole time no yeah no that's the

2125
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,239
whole time yeah yeah

2126
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:15,658
but that that's pretty funny yeah

2127
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:19,619
but yeah no I mean I I uh

2128
01:22:15,658 --> 01:22:21,960
um I I I I think I think uh a Haze by

2129
01:22:19,619 --> 01:22:23,640
Cookie would be super cool so I don't

2130
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,319
think it's a deep chunk by cookies

2131
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,119
didn't I do that

2132
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:28,738
I think I did that

2133
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,439
I think I did that and it was it was

2134
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:32,879
just a it molded like just a horrible

2135
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:34,979
mold machine

2136
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:38,480
yeah I mean whether it's from something

2137
01:22:34,979 --> 01:22:40,738
like Kim D or a headband or a haze

2138
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:43,198
depending on what kind of buzz you're

2139
01:22:40,738 --> 01:22:45,658
after you know I wouldn't do Kush

2140
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:48,238
specifically I would go chems just

2141
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:50,399
because there's so much cush already it

2142
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:52,319
would just I didn't read and that has

2143
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:53,819
been bred into it or whatever I think

2144
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:55,500
you'd be better off going for a

2145
01:22:53,819 --> 01:22:57,420
different potent indica

2146
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,738
uh family

2147
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,539
you know

2148
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:03,539
um because inbreeding is hard and that's

2149
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:06,359
kind of what Screwed cookie a bit is is

2150
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:09,238
inbreeding yeah you know and not going

2151
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:11,519
far enough outside and certainly Hayes

2152
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:14,339
would add a wild new bunch of genetics

2153
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,320
that they've never messed with yeah

2154
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:18,659
um but you're really what you're

2155
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:21,539
searching for is that invisible High I

2156
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:23,639
forgot that that Phil Tia Rojo did some

2157
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:26,760
of those crosses he did like uh

2158
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:28,560
a Bubba Haze I think he did a cookie

2159
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,000
series he did an OG Haze a few different

2160
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,520
ones that were really cool someone just

2161
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,880
mentioned that in the comments

2162
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:37,980
yeah I mean so I I think

2163
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,779
I don't I I would I would cross into

2164
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:42,899
some kind of chem

2165
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:45,000
and see where it went you know and I did

2166
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:47,639
like the chem 91 animal cookies that I

2167
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,800
ran that was pretty exceptional it was

2168
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:52,199
um it reminded me of a chem 91 without

2169
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:55,500
the shitty uh

2170
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:57,539
trait of eating itself but it it looked

2171
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:00,859
just like chem 91 but a lot more red

2172
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:03,000
yeah I think our our homies CSI is

2173
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:04,559
certainly with the Forum cut and stuff

2174
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,719
like that is done

2175
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,820
has certainly made some of those hybrids

2176
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:12,060
yeah um and he's been pretty excited

2177
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:14,039
about some of them uh chem 91 mixed with

2178
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:15,539
cookie is hilarious because it's got all

2179
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:18,060
the buzz you could ever want and it's

2180
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:19,260
one of the uglier things out there

2181
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,699
um so you're mixing it with something

2182
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:22,980
that's like really pretty and doesn't

2183
01:24:20,698 --> 01:24:24,539
have the buzz yeah so you're sort of

2184
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:27,178
definitely hoping for the looks from the

2185
01:24:24,539 --> 01:24:29,698
cookie and the wall up from the chem 91.

2186
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:32,100
but it's probably in there yeah um the

2187
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:33,599
only reason why I suggested chems or

2188
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,520
something like that is just to keep the

2189
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,600
whole thing the the structure manageable

2190
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,560
yeah definitely

2191
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:43,260
like

2192
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,420
mandible manageable trying to get to the

2193
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:47,579
manageable

2194
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:49,920
very good I get distracted by comments

2195
01:24:47,579 --> 01:24:52,439
yes you do it's okay that's why we keep

2196
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,899
you away from them uh but I look but I

2197
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:57,178
mean it's I uh you know

2198
01:24:54,899 --> 01:24:59,099
I don't know we'll see I mean we we

2199
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:00,420
might have you know that'll probably be

2200
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,880
a different episode or something like

2201
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:04,980
that but amongst the crew you know we

2202
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,819
have some some of the interesting pieces

2203
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:10,619
of this you know yeah

2204
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:13,559
um I thought this was an interesting one

2205
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:15,479
too huh just also along the lines of

2206
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,219
like the Appalachia cookies would be

2207
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:19,738
like a c99 cookies and I don't remember

2208
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:21,539
I'm sure someone's made that but I off

2209
01:25:19,738 --> 01:25:24,059
the top of my head I can't remember who

2210
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:25,619
would have made that and that that

2211
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,000
I mean

2212
01:25:25,619 --> 01:25:29,939
I don't think it would give you anything

2213
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,279
super unique with c99 cookies just like

2214
01:25:29,939 --> 01:25:34,619
you know but it is an appellation give

2215
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:36,719
you like a much better structure oh yeah

2216
01:25:34,619 --> 01:25:38,698
Appalachia could kill it because you got

2217
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:41,460
the candy in it so we already know what

2218
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:42,419
chemd and cookies do and uh with green

2219
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:44,279
crack

2220
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:45,779
yeah I mean that actually might be a

2221
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:47,519
good one because you'd have you'd have

2222
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:50,759
structure and potency if you could find

2223
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:52,140
the right mix exactly exactly and really

2224
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,860
good yields it could definitely increase

2225
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:54,860
the yields

2226
01:25:55,698 --> 01:26:04,500
I love Haze uh sorry Mr soul but uh c99

2227
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:07,560
is not on my bucket list of uh of hazes

2228
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:10,079
to keep I get why people like 1999 with

2229
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:12,179
Haze myself but it is

2230
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:14,579
I don't get it but I don't just bred

2231
01:26:12,179 --> 01:26:17,520
away from all the good parts of it yeah

2232
01:26:14,579 --> 01:26:20,340
it's he went for chunky and quick I get

2233
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,840
so much skunk one high from c99 that I

2234
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,880
just don't like it I associate with

2235
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,900
skunk one much more than Haze because of

2236
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:27,119
that

2237
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:29,219
um I get why people would I think he

2238
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:32,219
bred for looks

2239
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:35,158
quickness and weight

2240
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:37,679
who who Soul there I mean I'm sorry it

2241
01:26:35,158 --> 01:26:39,658
would be Sly yeah maybe I mean I think

2242
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:41,279
they I think they had a few seeds and

2243
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:43,079
popped them and gave out the cuts I

2244
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:44,759
don't think they bred for [ __ ]

2245
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:46,619
I think you don't believe any you don't

2246
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:48,239
believe any of the cubing [ __ ] or

2247
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:52,139
anything like that well I mean if if

2248
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:55,019
they're if their goal was to cube to

2249
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:57,239
make a line an inbred I mean because

2250
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:59,760
it's so wrong but you know yeah yeah but

2251
01:26:57,238 --> 01:27:02,218
I mean if their goal was to make a seed

2252
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,739
line that's uniform then they epically

2253
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:08,819
failed they epically failed because c99

2254
01:27:04,738 --> 01:27:09,718
is just shitloads of femos so yeah I

2255
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:12,420
mean

2256
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:15,060
I don't know I mean like I I have more

2257
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:17,460
faith that Sly could have done good

2258
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:20,639
breeding work as opposed to Seoul who

2259
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:23,760
was learning to breed in car or to grow

2260
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:24,920
and get grow tents in Colorado and uh to

2261
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,420
late

2262
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:28,920
2010-11 so yeah

2263
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:30,480
I don't know that that's just my

2264
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,460
personal opinion I had a lot of insight

2265
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:34,439
into seeing that and I was one of those

2266
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,840
people who um absolutely believed word

2267
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:39,599
for word that Soul knew a [ __ ] until I

2268
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:42,420
met him and then I realized oh my God

2269
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:44,039
who wears Sly who's this guy how did he

2270
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:47,340
[ __ ] get pushed out of the equation

2271
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:49,260
that's just my thing uh I mean I you

2272
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:53,400
know that's a different subject too but

2273
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:55,619
it is true that uh in the forums

2274
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:57,179
um there was a number of people that got

2275
01:27:55,619 --> 01:27:59,219
pretty famous

2276
01:27:57,179 --> 01:28:01,679
and it was sort of the first time that

2277
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:04,619
weed people could get a little famous

2278
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:07,500
in that way yeah right

2279
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:10,019
um and you knew what you knew about them

2280
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,279
through what their Persona you most most

2281
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:14,159
of these people didn't you didn't know

2282
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:18,899
them in real life yeah so you know names

2283
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:22,138
like Vic high or or Tom Hill or or uh

2284
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:24,299
you know Sly or you know DJ Short or

2285
01:28:22,139 --> 01:28:26,880
whatever you know these people are like

2286
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:28,500
producing seeds and making offerings and

2287
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:31,079
people are growing their stuff out and

2288
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:33,119
some of them got super famous right

2289
01:28:31,079 --> 01:28:35,340
but you don't know him in real life yeah

2290
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:37,019
I mean I didn't even know Tom Hill was

2291
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:39,480
my dad I found that out later in life

2292
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:44,120
it's super weird well don't start rumors

2293
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:47,218
people Papa Was a Rolling Stone yeah

2294
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:49,979
Papa Was a Rolling Stone Papa Was a

2295
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:52,500
Rolling Stone uh but yeah you know and

2296
01:28:49,979 --> 01:28:54,178
so it's like on forums especially ig's

2297
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:56,579
the same way it's like you only know

2298
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:58,619
what I mean you only know what people

2299
01:28:56,579 --> 01:29:00,479
present themselves as yeah for sure I

2300
01:28:58,619 --> 01:29:01,319
mean when you start to do a show like we

2301
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:03,839
do

2302
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:06,299
um people get you know dozens of hours

2303
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,880
of you chatting so maybe they can form a

2304
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:12,239
slightly like more nuanced opinion yeah

2305
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:14,100
but you know posts Forum posts and IG

2306
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:17,579
posts and all that that can be heavily

2307
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:20,940
curated around an image or around a a

2308
01:29:17,579 --> 01:29:22,198
you know a phantom even you know yep uh

2309
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:24,359
there's lots of things that you don't

2310
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:27,479
see

2311
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:29,460
yeah unfortunately I think uh

2312
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:33,059
I think a lot of people

2313
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:34,800
make very I mean I I guess that's what

2314
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,840
even what I did is I was getting on the

2315
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,679
forums I made very

2316
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,779
um

2317
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:42,060
I made a lot of assumptions about people

2318
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:44,819
based on how I saw them interacting with

2319
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:47,820
what they were presenting and

2320
01:29:44,819 --> 01:29:49,619
and luckily you know during the time

2321
01:29:47,819 --> 01:29:51,359
when I when I was first starting there

2322
01:29:49,619 --> 01:29:53,819
weren't a lot of seed makers so I got to

2323
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,679
meet a lot of them in person and that's

2324
01:29:53,819 --> 01:29:57,059
when I realized how much was smoke and

2325
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:59,340
mirrors and even when I talked to people

2326
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:02,039
about me and stuff in my life and what I

2327
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:03,480
present everything is what I want to

2328
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:05,760
show you know nobody wants to show you

2329
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:07,379
the dude you know having trouble taking

2330
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,060
a [ __ ] because he didn't eat enough

2331
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:10,079
fiber you know nobody wants to see that

2332
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,940
part

2333
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:13,800
um it's all curated to it I don't want

2334
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:15,319
to see that either I actually FaceTime

2335
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:19,619
not so while I'm doing

2336
01:30:15,319 --> 01:30:22,619
oh my God so but yeah I mean it it it's

2337
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:26,219
true it's it's um you know there are

2338
01:30:22,619 --> 01:30:28,559
some people that will stun you uh with

2339
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:30,480
the level of knowledge that they have

2340
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:33,000
about the plant and about reading when

2341
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:37,859
you meet them and there are people that

2342
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:42,060
will stun you into oh my God right this

2343
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:44,279
is like the Forest Gump of wheat yeah

2344
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:45,539
yeah isn't that your nickname this

2345
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:47,639
person just yeah that's yeah I think

2346
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:49,198
just stumbled around and bumped into a

2347
01:30:47,639 --> 01:30:51,900
bunch of cool [ __ ] along the way but he

2348
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:54,419
was totally you know yeah he was

2349
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:57,000
completely oblivious and half aware the

2350
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:59,639
whole time you know yeah um that's me

2351
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,319
you know uh just stumbling stumbling

2352
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:03,600
blindly around into one thing or another

2353
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:05,340
and see I kind of felt like that's how I

2354
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,380
did though like I I don't feel like I

2355
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:09,719
had any right to be in the crew that I

2356
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:11,880
was with in San Diego or have access to

2357
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:13,859
the the cuts that I did early on looking

2358
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:16,079
back I'm like you know a lot of people

2359
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:17,639
spend years you know trying to hunt down

2360
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:20,158
pure kush and stuff and that was just

2361
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:21,719
there you know or Hog's Breath that was

2362
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:23,219
just there

2363
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:24,779
um well I think that's what a lot of

2364
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:26,579
this is it's just knocking around

2365
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:27,960
stumbling around and hoping you don't

2366
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:29,719
constantly run into someone who's gonna

2367
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:33,658
screw you

2368
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:34,980
yeah I mean and to be fair to everyone I

2369
01:31:33,658 --> 01:31:38,879
will say

2370
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:41,519
that while Matt and I have you know we

2371
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,619
there's plenty of stories over and over

2372
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,440
and over again about how bad seed rules

2373
01:31:43,619 --> 01:31:49,559
the game and how people accidents happen

2374
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:51,960
and become very famous

2375
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:55,620
I'm having a hard time thinking of

2376
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:57,000
someone who just simply said oh my God I

2377
01:31:55,619 --> 01:31:59,279
got hella lucky

2378
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,039
yeah I partied all weekend my room

2379
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:04,738
hermed I got a few seeds I popped them

2380
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:07,079
holy [ __ ] it was there got super famous

2381
01:32:04,738 --> 01:32:09,059
I didn't even breed before that I was

2382
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:10,679
pissed off when it when it when it got

2383
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:13,380
seeded because I was worried that it was

2384
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:14,760
going to affect my price point and it's

2385
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:16,440
the most famous thing I've ever done in

2386
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:19,619
my life and it was a total accident and

2387
01:32:16,439 --> 01:32:22,019
uh you know one person I can think of

2388
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:23,279
but he changed the story later on to be

2389
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:26,580
a much like

2390
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:28,079
calculator I will say calculator he came

2391
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:29,760
out first and I'm not even a [ __ ]

2392
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:32,039
breeder I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm

2393
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:34,619
doing this thing's good you know with

2394
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:37,019
the mac and uh after that story change

2395
01:32:34,619 --> 01:32:39,059
you know as far as rage for three days

2396
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:41,280
and my light timer went off the wrong

2397
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:43,199
way and I I came back and passed out

2398
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:44,880
from the concert and took me two days to

2399
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:48,960
check on my room and then

2400
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,300
you know and and and and I'm so all the

2401
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,819
accidents that have happened or whatever

2402
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:56,699
uh you know basically it's like after

2403
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:59,819
you get famous people start trying to

2404
01:32:56,698 --> 01:33:02,779
add intention and care and that they

2405
01:32:59,819 --> 01:33:05,099
were some reclusive garage genius

2406
01:33:02,779 --> 01:33:07,500
carefully mixing these things together

2407
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:08,880
until they finally got a product to show

2408
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,560
the world

2409
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,420
yeah right

2410
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:16,199
um and that's not typically how it works

2411
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:18,899
uh typically when you do that you fail

2412
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:21,059
um and uh you know and and it was a

2413
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:23,339
bunch of work for nothing yeah um not

2414
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:25,620
that you might not make good work uh

2415
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:27,300
that's not what I'm saying but yeah um

2416
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:29,158
getting famous is weird

2417
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:31,020
yeah and getting famous and you know

2418
01:33:29,158 --> 01:33:33,599
having a strain take off

2419
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:39,300
is uh it's not something that you really

2420
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:41,699
totally control no I I I I rarely I mean

2421
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:43,260
I don't think people really capture

2422
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:44,698
lightning in a bottle twice unless

2423
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:46,560
they're already rich you know if you're

2424
01:33:44,698 --> 01:33:48,119
already rich and you can put on a good

2425
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,920
marketing campaign you can push yourself

2426
01:33:48,119 --> 01:33:51,899
to a good spot we've seen that with rare

2427
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,539
daintenance and several other companies

2428
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:57,299
as they started brand new company big

2429
01:33:54,539 --> 01:33:59,100
ads in High Times bam they're at the top

2430
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:02,340
you know

2431
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:05,280
um but yeah I mean it is really hard to

2432
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:08,760
to push hype on

2433
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:10,500
a cannabis Community pre-instagram it

2434
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:13,020
was yeah I mean and even if you push

2435
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:15,840
hype unless it's something that catches

2436
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:18,000
the Public's flavor and eye anyway yeah

2437
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,400
I you know that's why we see so many

2438
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,439
strains that get hyped and for six

2439
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:25,198
months or a year or 16 months or

2440
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:27,238
something they'd catch a good ticket and

2441
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:30,658
then the community's like ah

2442
01:34:27,238 --> 01:34:32,759
yep I don't know about that one and it's

2443
01:34:30,658 --> 01:34:34,079
like how many of how many of things in

2444
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,780
the last three or four years that have

2445
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:38,158
been hyped since things went legal do

2446
01:34:36,779 --> 01:34:40,738
you think are still going to be hype

2447
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:42,839
weed 10 years from now yeah or have a

2448
01:34:40,738 --> 01:34:44,638
Resurgence there's a lot of them that

2449
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:47,219
got hyped and they got a marketing

2450
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:50,219
machine turned on and then it you know

2451
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:52,500
and I mean take it's like uh it's hard

2452
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:53,939
enough in weed to have a one it's like

2453
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,939
music right

2454
01:34:53,939 --> 01:35:00,000
you can diss one hit wonders all you

2455
01:34:56,939 --> 01:35:01,259
want yeah most musicians never even get

2456
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,219
that far

2457
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:08,039
yeah one to have one big hit

2458
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:09,000
yeah right that like everybody knows the

2459
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:11,158
song

2460
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,380
most musicians don't get that that's

2461
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:16,859
rare you know and then it's and then

2462
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:19,440
most big bands and most acts maybe they

2463
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:21,899
stay together four to seven years

2464
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:24,960
yeah it's the rare ones that are

2465
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:26,460
together 15 20 25 30 and stay relevant

2466
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,920
throughout that time those are like

2467
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:30,719
unicorns yeah because I mean even in

2468
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,760
marriages it's hard to put up with

2469
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:34,439
someone for a set amount of years and be

2470
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:35,880
live that close to them and have that

2471
01:35:34,439 --> 01:35:38,460
many disagreements and not kill each

2472
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:40,139
other so yeah I watched it yeah it's

2473
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:42,179
crazy but then there's but then there's

2474
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:44,159
also staying in the public eye and the

2475
01:35:42,179 --> 01:35:46,859
public still liking the new things that

2476
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:49,259
you're doing after time yeah and so and

2477
01:35:46,859 --> 01:35:51,000
so if you want to apply that to to weed

2478
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:53,280
or whatever

2479
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,960
um you know like let's let's stay in

2480
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:56,340
cookie and this isn't meant to be a disc

2481
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,679
to him by any means so don't take it

2482
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:01,739
that way but you know what is sherbinski

2483
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:03,920
done since sure been gelato

2484
01:36:01,738 --> 01:36:05,879
and when did those things

2485
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,319
come out

2486
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:09,359
yeah

2487
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:11,399
you know it's been over 10 years right

2488
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:14,759
yeah

2489
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:16,379
you know a lot of what [ __ ] and on

2490
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,239
those guys made

2491
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:20,219
um with cookies it turns out that they

2492
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:22,019
didn't even actually make it right yeah

2493
01:36:20,219 --> 01:36:24,359
they've had they've they've basically

2494
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:26,880
have taken under their brand various

2495
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:28,799
house breeders at different times

2496
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,560
yeah I don't know who they all are but

2497
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,779
at one point it was sea Junkie you know

2498
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:36,420
at one point it was freaking uh what's

2499
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:38,340
his name uh compound I love the fact

2500
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:41,219
that they hired

2501
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:43,260
a breeder who couldn't even [ __ ] grow

2502
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:45,960
which means there were two middlemen

2503
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:48,539
between the seed maker and the buyer

2504
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:50,520
that is just when you hear that that is

2505
01:36:48,539 --> 01:36:52,139
just I love it yeah you know and you

2506
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,940
know they've got uh Kenny Powers who's

2507
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:55,920
actually pretty nice uh who's been

2508
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:57,479
playing around on a small level for them

2509
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,399
in the background for a long time and

2510
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:02,218
making things for them

2511
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:04,138
um but as far as you know I mean you

2512
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:06,119
know what the last the most famous thing

2513
01:37:04,139 --> 01:37:08,400
that jig has done in the last five or

2514
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:10,380
six years is probably like rip everybody

2515
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:12,059
off for Candy Rain because they didn't

2516
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:14,579
do a germ test before they sold the

2517
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:16,739
seeds and then everybody found out that

2518
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:18,479
you know basically half of them wouldn't

2519
01:37:16,738 --> 01:37:20,638
Sprout and then a bunch of them were

2520
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:22,738
mutants one of the awesome videos I was

2521
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:24,840
going to include was Kenny Powers saying

2522
01:37:22,738 --> 01:37:27,899
how he's from the streets so he doesn't

2523
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:30,480
enter into any of that genetic [ __ ] yeah

2524
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:32,219
I mean that's my favorite blog they uh

2525
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:34,198
you know it's it's kind of like cookies

2526
01:37:32,219 --> 01:37:35,760
is like you know they you see them open

2527
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:37,559
in New York or whatever and it's like

2528
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,000
get the band back together again all the

2529
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:41,820
friends are older they they've got gray

2530
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,560
in their hair now but it all kind of you

2531
01:37:41,819 --> 01:37:45,779
know catapulted them into a different

2532
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:47,820
world than the last 10 or 15 years than

2533
01:37:45,779 --> 01:37:49,920
it would have otherwise yeah

2534
01:37:47,819 --> 01:37:51,779
you know and and I think it's the same

2535
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:54,000
thing it's it's an issue for you and

2536
01:37:51,779 --> 01:37:55,559
everybody else too it's like you talk

2537
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,219
about it you talk about it we have

2538
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:01,320
private chats about it where in the 90s

2539
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:03,719
um you could have seed companies that

2540
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:06,779
had the same eight or ten lines

2541
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:09,060
for five ten years

2542
01:38:06,779 --> 01:38:10,139
and Matt will joke with me that if he

2543
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,940
doesn't come out with something every

2544
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:14,219
eight months people think he retired or

2545
01:38:11,939 --> 01:38:16,919
died oh yeah yeah

2546
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:19,198
right yeah I mean I did that six-month

2547
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:21,179
Hiatus off Instagram and literally

2548
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:24,779
people were like yeah he's done dude why

2549
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:27,179
yep who you know it doesn't take much to

2550
01:38:24,779 --> 01:38:28,920
to fall out of the public eye

2551
01:38:27,179 --> 01:38:30,960
yeah and then and then on top of that

2552
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:33,600
right it's like so going back to like

2553
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,939
the the one hit wonder right you go see

2554
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,579
some one-hit wonder band at a casino

2555
01:38:35,939 --> 01:38:40,439
right and they're still on Tour 20 years

2556
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:42,899
later and what do you know they're gonna

2557
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:45,839
play for sure

2558
01:38:42,899 --> 01:38:48,299
that one hit that one hit you're gonna

2559
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,819
hear it and so for a lot of these

2560
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:52,980
breeders and this is an issue in this is

2561
01:38:50,819 --> 01:38:55,319
an issue in breeding in general right

2562
01:38:52,979 --> 01:38:57,539
and so this is this is not to throw

2563
01:38:55,319 --> 01:39:00,119
shade but typically a breeder gets

2564
01:38:57,539 --> 01:39:02,639
famous for a specific line or a specific

2565
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:05,099
cut or whatever it might be

2566
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:07,920
and then they just remixed that same cut

2567
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:09,480
forever yeah

2568
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,460
right

2569
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:12,718
yeah it used to be the standard that

2570
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:14,819
that used to be what it used to be the

2571
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:17,219
standard like you know across to

2572
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:19,579
everything like NorCal icmag or whatever

2573
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:21,960
it got famous for OG KB

2574
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:24,420
and instead of branching off in

2575
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:26,100
different directions over time you know

2576
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,600
he's like you know as far as a few

2577
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,340
months ago or whatever he was like

2578
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,420
there's more ogkb coming down the

2579
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:33,239
pipeline

2580
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:34,619
I like coaching KP I'm not I'm not

2581
01:39:33,238 --> 01:39:37,079
dissing it I'm just saying that like

2582
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:39,000
that's typically what happens is you the

2583
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:41,460
thing you get famous off of

2584
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,920
yeah you start doing variations on that

2585
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:46,198
theme forever I did that with uh the

2586
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,000
Clockwork Orange for for a long time and

2587
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:51,359
it just it seems like that is what you

2588
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,579
like the the typical seed company thing

2589
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:55,619
you do yeah you don't like the swamp the

2590
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:57,179
you know the swamp boys with TK they've

2591
01:39:55,619 --> 01:39:59,099
branched out recently and done different

2592
01:39:57,179 --> 01:40:00,960
things I was wondering why they didn't

2593
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:02,699
do more with the white

2594
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,260
because I mean that was like their [ __ ]

2595
01:40:02,698 --> 01:40:05,339
and like the Chrome's Blockhead I always

2596
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:07,739
thought that would be cool to bring back

2597
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:09,239
yeah they didn't I mean but I just I

2598
01:40:07,738 --> 01:40:11,579
just mean that like typically look at

2599
01:40:09,238 --> 01:40:13,019
like dying breed with Skittles you know

2600
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:16,198
or the Skittles crew like what's the

2601
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:18,000
Skittles crew gonna do next yeah and is

2602
01:40:16,198 --> 01:40:19,099
it gonna have the same impact work with

2603
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,119
snitches

2604
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:23,400
you know what's what's what are they

2605
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:25,738
going to do next yeah yeah for sure and

2606
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:27,479
and so it's an issue with like all BR

2607
01:40:25,738 --> 01:40:30,000
like if breeders are lucky enough that

2608
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:32,279
like one line gets hella famous

2609
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,899
yeah it's risky to just be like this is

2610
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:35,399
totally unknown I'm going in a totally

2611
01:40:33,899 --> 01:40:37,079
different direction this isn't what I'm

2612
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:38,879
known for at all

2613
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:41,519
yeah but this is where my interest is

2614
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:44,819
now and I made that hit eight years ago

2615
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,440
and I'm not remixing it anymore yep it's

2616
01:40:44,819 --> 01:40:48,238
just in the past and you can get it if

2617
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:50,638
you want but this is the direction I'm

2618
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:53,399
going in now yeah that doesn't really

2619
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:55,500
happen very often in weed no I I you

2620
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:57,179
know and and I can just comment on this

2621
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:58,979
a little bit because when I made that

2622
01:40:57,179 --> 01:41:00,899
decision with the Clockwork I also had

2623
01:40:58,979 --> 01:41:03,658
to come to the realization that

2624
01:41:00,899 --> 01:41:05,399
it can disappear like maybe no one will

2625
01:41:03,658 --> 01:41:07,138
take interest in it after it's gone

2626
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:09,658
maybe what if it just drops and that's

2627
01:41:07,139 --> 01:41:11,159
that maybe you know but there's also the

2628
01:41:09,658 --> 01:41:12,779
case of what if someone I don't like

2629
01:41:11,158 --> 01:41:14,879
runs with it

2630
01:41:12,779 --> 01:41:16,679
this is my baby this is our Flagship

2631
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,819
what if someone I don't like there's all

2632
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:21,060
kinds of things that went through my

2633
01:41:17,819 --> 01:41:23,460
head at that and then as a breeder when

2634
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:24,719
you're making that decision uh to to

2635
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,100
work with something that's not so

2636
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:27,779
popular or something that someone else

2637
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:30,120
has worked with for years that you can

2638
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:31,979
still get that is a big decision to make

2639
01:41:30,119 --> 01:41:33,960
it's hard to break away from from what

2640
01:41:31,979 --> 01:41:38,638
sells no those are all the cuts that I

2641
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:40,380
like the not so popular ones yeah right

2642
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:43,440
um yeah but I mean and that's the thing

2643
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:46,340
though is that what's funny is that if

2644
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:48,539
you are a non-commercial breeder right

2645
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:50,699
you have total freedom to do whatever

2646
01:41:48,539 --> 01:41:53,100
the [ __ ] you want yeah

2647
01:41:50,698 --> 01:41:54,960
because you can because you're just

2648
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:57,060
making it for you and your friends yeah

2649
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,439
but if you're a commercial breeder and

2650
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:00,239
you get into all that and you get into

2651
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:02,219
all the packaging and you get into like

2652
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:04,019
I mean now it's kind of ending the gray

2653
01:42:02,219 --> 01:42:06,779
area because everybody has to be fully

2654
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:08,400
legal and and regulated but like that

2655
01:42:06,779 --> 01:42:10,259
whole era where you're buying a booth

2656
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:12,059
you know and you're doing all this

2657
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:14,159
different stuff and all that like

2658
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:16,500
there's a lot of expense that goes into

2659
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:18,539
it yeah you know and so a lot of people

2660
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:20,100
breeding just want to hit they just want

2661
01:42:18,539 --> 01:42:22,079
to get on base they want a good hit they

2662
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:25,739
want a good they want to next this is my

2663
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:27,539
next release right yeah and so you look

2664
01:42:25,738 --> 01:42:28,919
at a lot of people's breeding stock and

2665
01:42:27,539 --> 01:42:31,679
you're like oh that's the three things

2666
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:33,239
you're basing everything on

2667
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,679
yeah and then what if you're in your 30s

2668
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:36,238
and you want to still be doing it in

2669
01:42:34,679 --> 01:42:39,359
your 50s and 60s you're just gonna have

2670
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:41,819
20 or 30 years off the same basic [ __ ]

2671
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:44,420
the smartest thing that

2672
01:42:41,819 --> 01:42:47,880
anyone's ever told me as it relates to

2673
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:49,980
cannabis and being a a seed company was

2674
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,560
from CSI and he said never tie yourself

2675
01:42:49,979 --> 01:42:53,819
to one clone never ever tie yourself to

2676
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,340
one clone

2677
01:42:53,819 --> 01:42:58,079
said the second you do that the second

2678
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,699
you're locked into one clone and if

2679
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:01,559
someone else gets that you're no longer

2680
01:42:59,698 --> 01:43:03,539
important and if you tied yourself to

2681
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,219
one clone you can't you can't create new

2682
01:43:03,539 --> 01:43:08,460
you know I thought that was brilliant

2683
01:43:05,219 --> 01:43:10,800
but there's also a thing of like were

2684
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:13,079
you a breeder and something happened

2685
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:15,480
along the way that you got famous while

2686
01:43:13,079 --> 01:43:17,519
you were already a breeder like say take

2687
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:21,539
something like I don't know you know

2688
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:23,940
star dog yeah right like JJ was you know

2689
01:43:21,539 --> 01:43:25,859
top dog was already a breeder yeah you

2690
01:43:23,939 --> 01:43:28,618
know and making a bunch of crosses when

2691
01:43:25,859 --> 01:43:30,779
stardog got famous yeah right but take

2692
01:43:28,618 --> 01:43:32,939
something like uh like Skittles or like

2693
01:43:30,779 --> 01:43:35,039
a lot of breeders they get they start

2694
01:43:32,939 --> 01:43:37,859
breeding when they have a famous cut

2695
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:40,679
yeah that other people can't get access

2696
01:43:37,859 --> 01:43:42,839
to yeah and so what happens when your

2697
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:45,600
whole breeding career is based upon

2698
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:47,039
access I mean I remember you know I

2699
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,360
can't remember it was 10 years ago now

2700
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:50,760
eight years ago or something when

2701
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:52,500
Skittles was first hitting the scene and

2702
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:54,719
we would go to Emerald cup

2703
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:57,479
and that would be a line

2704
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,739
waiting to buy you know 10 seeds for

2705
01:43:57,479 --> 01:44:00,299
three to five hundred dollars of

2706
01:43:58,738 --> 01:44:02,939
Skittles hybrids because nobody could

2707
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:03,679
get five yeah mostly five yeah a lot of

2708
01:44:02,939 --> 01:44:07,618
them

2709
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:09,719
you know and um and you know so some of

2710
01:44:07,618 --> 01:44:12,179
those guys became breeders at like

2711
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:14,760
cookie or Skittles or whatever when they

2712
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:16,859
got a famous cut yeah

2713
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:18,360
you know I mean NorCal probably became

2714
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:20,819
you know a breeder when it was like all

2715
01:44:18,359 --> 01:44:24,000
of a sudden OG KB was the [ __ ]

2716
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:25,139
and people wanted it real bad yeah and

2717
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,079
they'll be like well I won't give it to

2718
01:44:25,139 --> 01:44:30,060
you but I'll give you hybrids

2719
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:31,920
you know so did you become a breeder to

2720
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:33,840
breed or did you get a hold of something

2721
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,760
famous and you're like man I could also

2722
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:37,020
make money selling seeds off this [ __ ]

2723
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,579
yeah

2724
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:40,380
because then what do you do next what's

2725
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:42,539
your next album gonna look like

2726
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:44,819
that's where it goes I mean that's why

2727
01:44:42,539 --> 01:44:46,800
you see a lot of these dudes scramble

2728
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:48,299
right sure you know and it's like it's

2729
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,000
the same thing in music it's like how do

2730
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:52,739
you stay relevant over 20 30 years

2731
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,319
you have to keep Reinventing yourself

2732
01:44:52,738 --> 01:44:58,079
always you look at the you look at the

2733
01:44:55,319 --> 01:45:00,179
history of seed breeding uh who's ever

2734
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:01,559
you know uh the next person that does

2735
01:45:00,179 --> 01:45:03,359
that will be the first

2736
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:06,239
yeah

2737
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:09,420
who's who's really even over a 20-year

2738
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:12,178
period who's stayed relevant

2739
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:15,239
that's a hard one

2740
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:17,219
I would have to say probably you know

2741
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:19,198
the the one that I remember you know

2742
01:45:17,219 --> 01:45:21,539
even though people always joking me that

2743
01:45:19,198 --> 01:45:24,599
I'm it is Neville

2744
01:45:21,539 --> 01:45:25,859
right because yes yes but you can laugh

2745
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:28,860
but it's like you know he started in

2746
01:45:25,859 --> 01:45:31,259
1985. yeah with all those things and

2747
01:45:28,859 --> 01:45:34,079
then in probably like in 98

2748
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:36,000
right so you know what is that 13 years

2749
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:38,519
later or something he released mango

2750
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,439
Haze Super Silver Haze and Knuckles yeah

2751
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:42,360
and certainly you know especially

2752
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:43,919
counting the super silver haze that had

2753
01:45:42,359 --> 01:45:46,380
massive impact

2754
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,118
yeah right

2755
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:50,159
but think of somebody think of somebody

2756
01:45:48,118 --> 01:45:52,019
else that like 15 years after they got

2757
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:55,379
famous came up with something that also

2758
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:57,540
made them Super Famous again yeah the

2759
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:59,880
hard one

2760
01:45:57,539 --> 01:46:03,840
you know most people are retired or

2761
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:06,179
busted or or you know over it you know

2762
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:08,219
and even dealing with the public is the

2763
01:46:06,179 --> 01:46:10,920
in that long is a huge pain in the ass

2764
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:12,480
yeah there's a lot of uh older breeders

2765
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:14,460
that I've tried to come get back out

2766
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:16,138
work with the public again and they just

2767
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:17,819
want nothing to do with it just because

2768
01:46:16,139 --> 01:46:19,139
it's just not worth it it's not they've

2769
01:46:17,819 --> 01:46:20,279
seen what I've dealt with they've seen

2770
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:21,719
when other people dealt with they're

2771
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:25,618
like no huh

2772
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:27,539
announcement me so far yeah exactly or

2773
01:46:25,618 --> 01:46:29,759
like release something and I'm like oh

2774
01:46:27,539 --> 01:46:31,439
yeah that's all the stuff you go through

2775
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,440
and all the things you tell me it just

2776
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:37,259
sounds swell yeah you know

2777
01:46:34,439 --> 01:46:39,118
really swell so we're hitting the almost

2778
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:40,920
uh end of the show we got to end it

2779
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:42,420
before the two hour mark and we're right

2780
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,980
about there

2781
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:45,539
um I think we've covered a lot of this

2782
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:48,599
is there anything else you wanted to run

2783
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:50,939
into while we still have time oh yeah I

2784
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:53,280
guess we do I guess we are coming close

2785
01:46:50,939 --> 01:46:55,079
um you know there was uh there's

2786
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:57,179
obviously a lot more that you could talk

2787
01:46:55,079 --> 01:46:59,039
about with cookies sure I don't want to

2788
01:46:57,179 --> 01:47:01,039
say we just scratched the surface but

2789
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:03,300
it's Matt and I do a pretty like

2790
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:05,880
free-flowing uh where does the

2791
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:07,500
conversation take us kind of style

2792
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:09,239
um there's a lot of like cultural impact

2793
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:10,560
that it had there's a lot more depth in

2794
01:47:09,238 --> 01:47:12,299
breeding there's different things that

2795
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,639
we could have brought up

2796
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:16,679
um because it's one of the big it's you

2797
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,779
know there's uh you know there's a lot

2798
01:47:16,679 --> 01:47:20,399
to it right yeah some of it we danced

2799
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:22,139
around some of we avoided some of it

2800
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,479
just isn't our interest you know Matt

2801
01:47:22,139 --> 01:47:27,420
and I's interest is much more the the

2802
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:29,519
plant side of things than the than the

2803
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:31,440
people Nest some you know in certain

2804
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,900
aspects right

2805
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:35,339
um but you know there's uh I do think

2806
01:47:33,899 --> 01:47:36,960
that there's a lot of rumor out there

2807
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:39,239
about it I do think we dropped a few

2808
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:40,920
tidbits that I'm pretty confident uh

2809
01:47:39,238 --> 01:47:42,959
people will find interesting tonight so

2810
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:45,539
that I think that's neat

2811
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:48,000
um there is a dude uh

2812
01:47:45,539 --> 01:47:50,460
there's a dude on on IG I'll shout out

2813
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,380
for a second sure um uh his name's

2814
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:54,420
Buckshot Hill

2815
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,859
um his family's been growing for a long

2816
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:58,199
time

2817
01:47:55,859 --> 01:48:00,599
um and he's trying to hunt through and

2818
01:47:58,198 --> 01:48:01,979
find some old like early Pearl and

2819
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,440
different stuff like that that his

2820
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:06,599
family used to grow and he was young and

2821
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:08,099
his great uncle just died this week uh

2822
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:10,619
and his great uncle

2823
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:12,840
is uh as he says I didn't know him but

2824
01:48:10,618 --> 01:48:14,819
he said he was an OG grower

2825
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:17,460
um and he was part of the Kate Wolf

2826
01:48:14,819 --> 01:48:19,799
festival for a long time which is a Folk

2827

Festival that the hog farm family throws

up at the Black Oak Ranch in Laytonville

2829
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:27,000
in Mendo so he was part of that extended

2830
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,679
family for a long time and apparently

2831
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,139
he's been growing for decades and he

2832
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:34,800
just passed away it at a ripe old age so

2833
01:48:31,139 --> 01:48:37,199
uh condolences to his family

2834
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:40,020
um and we are losing a lot of that first

2835

in peace moment of silence

2838
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:51,359
and if you have

2839
01:48:48,118 --> 01:48:53,279
old people in your family or community

2840
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:55,738
that have been growing for a really long

2841
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:57,960
time and have stories try to get those

2842
01:48:55,738 --> 01:48:59,459
stories from them yeah because once

2843
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:01,980
they're gone they're gone and most of

2844
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:03,779
our weed history is oral and you never

2845
01:49:01,979 --> 01:49:05,459
know what little tidbits or different

2846
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:07,380
pieces of information that might fit

2847
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:09,480
into a puzzle

2848
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:11,400
um are sitting in those people's heads

2849
01:49:09,479 --> 01:49:13,979
yeah you know most people don't know

2850
01:49:11,399 --> 01:49:17,118
that not so's biggest Fascination uh

2851
01:49:13,979 --> 01:49:21,178
revolves around oral too which is

2852
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:24,118
it is it is a fascination of mine uh

2853
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:25,980
because you know uh

2854
01:49:24,118 --> 01:49:29,039
um you know human writing is a fairly

2855
01:49:25,979 --> 01:49:32,158
modern invention and for most of human

2856
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:35,100
history all history was oral yeah right

2857
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:37,799
and wheat history because it was illicit

2858
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:40,560
and clandestine and illegal for the most

2859
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,940
part uh wasn't exactly written down you

2860
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:44,340
didn't have a bunch of people getting on

2861
01:49:41,939 --> 01:49:47,399
camera like we are now and talking about

2862
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:50,940
it until recently so most of the people

2863
01:49:47,399 --> 01:49:53,819
involved in the 60s 70s and 80s are

2864
01:49:50,939 --> 01:49:55,500
still mysterious yeah and they're and

2865
01:49:53,819 --> 01:49:57,000
they're older now

2866
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:59,698
