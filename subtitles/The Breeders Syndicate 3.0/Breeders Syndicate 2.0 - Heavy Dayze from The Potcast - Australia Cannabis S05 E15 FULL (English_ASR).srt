so we're here with heavy days from the

14
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,000
podcast and um we wanted to talk with

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,379
him about his journey through cannabis

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,819
where he started how he got into

17
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:08,519
podcasting period not only that but

18
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,459
taking that journey into breeding into

19
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,899
making seeds and um and and the whole

20
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,339
political climate in Australia and

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,320
however how he's grown throughout this

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,680
journey so I want to start from the

23
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,679
beginning with you do this kind of um A

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,840
to Z how did you get started where did

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,520
you get that that spark for cannabis in

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Australia

27
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,420
yeah great question

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,100
um I guess first off I'll just say you

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,740
know huge thanks for having me on guys

30
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,679
it's a pleasure to be joined by some of

31
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:41,339
my my favorite podcasts so super stoked

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,380
and um yeah to your question good good

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,740
question right because the Australians

34
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:49,078
seen historically has been just very

35
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,000
fledgling and very much in the shadows

36
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,158
of the US

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,438
um sort of wasn't a lot of notable

38
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,820
figures doing much when I first started

39
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,000
getting interested in cannabis which

40
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,438
would have been around

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,078
2013-ish yeah that was when I started

42
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,779
getting really serious

43
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:09,419
and I think initially the thing that

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,159
like really was the light bulb moment

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,259
for me was

46
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,199
um I actually tried some imported

47
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,739
Californian weed and I was like wow you

48
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,719
can like weed can be this good and prior

49
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,000
to that all I'd had was like the

50
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,378
Australian equivalent of beasters

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,239
so

52
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,759
for a long time I was like yeah cannabis

53
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,620
is cool but whatever and um yeah then

54
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,539
you try this Californian stuff and I

55
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,520
remember specifically it was it was said

56
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,378
that it was Granddaddy Purple but

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,959
looking back with what I know now it

58
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:42,659
definitely was not Grandpa

59
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,360
it was uh it was very green and it had a

60
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,598
very generic sweet smell not that sort

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,519
of Earthly yeah you'd expect

62
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,039
um but it it was nonetheless a light

63
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,939
bulb moment and then the next batch I

64
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,919
got

65
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,840
uh there was a few things that there was

66
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,458
like some Jack Herer which wasn't Jack

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
Herer there was some Girl Scout cookies

68
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,319
that wasn't Girl Scout cookies but there

69
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,059
was purple kush and I think it is the

70
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,518
Purple Kush that sort of goes around a

71
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,920
bit and that one made a very lasting

72
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,259
impact on me and I think the ball got

73
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,559
rolling from there and I had I had done

74
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,539
a grow before that but I got mediocre

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,739
results and it was my first gross you

76
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,199
know it was going to be a bit dog [Â __Â ]

77
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,259
anyway and yeah you end up growing out

78
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:28,619
you know like DNA or whatever because

79
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,239
always yeah like it's it's a given your

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,400
first grow you don't know who's a good

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,000
breeder so you're just gonna get lost in

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,819
the marketing so so yes I came back to

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,699
it and um I just started getting

84
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,518
interested in it and at the time I was

85
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,798
applying for graduate school and part of

86
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,840
the entry requirement was um there was

87
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,260
like this essay component and I wasn't

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,200
good at writing so I started um writing

89
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,179
these largely speaking sort of opinion

90
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,459
pieces on cannabis and sort of the state

91
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,280
of the scene in Australia and I would

92
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,840
talk about how I was sort of a bit let

93
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,158
down

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,019
um I would talk about how I was sort of

95
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,598
a bit let down by the Australian scene

96
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,280
because from my perspective the

97
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,738
penalties for growing cannabis were far

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,780
less than the states and so there was a

99
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,120
huge incentive to get at it like why not

100
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,120
the penalties are pretty minimal and yet

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,740
no one had really done it and so I I

102
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,060
sort of wrote this opinion piece saying

103
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,560
you know I think the Australian scene is

104
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,180
pretty apathetic compared to the

105
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,740
American scene you know like during the

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,560
Reagan Administration like people going

107
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,500
to jail for just for incredible periods

108
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,660
of time and I just don't think the same

109
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,639
legalities were at play in Australia for

110
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,439
a long time and so yeah I was just

111
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,319
writing these opinion pieces and saying

112
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:46,439
like you know if you want to

113
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,180
um help get things legal in Australia we

114
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,699
need to be more open because at the time

115
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,340
I knew a bunch of like white collar

116
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,840
professional guys who grew but they were

117
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,939
totally in the closet they wouldn't tell

118
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,319
anyone about it and I sort of tried to

119
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,060
encourage people and I was like the more

120
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,519
you put this out there the more people

121
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,040
accept that you can be like you know a

122
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,139
family man with a job and and still grow

123
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,240
on the side you know yeah you don't have

124
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,800
to be a criminal like in a criminal

125
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,439
organization you can you can have a

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,470
normal family life anger yeah unlike the

127
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,860
way I look right now

128
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,860
[Laughter]

129
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:26,099
but uh but yeah so so I think that was

130
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,500
sort of how I got my um my feet wet was

131
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,300
I was writing these opinion pieces and I

132
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,519
got to admit it was all sort of guys

133
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,319
just an experiment for me to get better

134
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,120
at writing and it was just subject

135
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,918
matter that I was somewhat familiar with

136
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,959
and then

137
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,279
um I guess the and this is probably the

138
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,978
part that I haven't really spoken to

139
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,459
people much about I then got the idea of

140
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:49,560
like well let's do a podcast and what

141
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,079
you find is if you're like a no-name

142
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,759
person like I was at the time and you

143
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,680
ask people hey would you like to come on

144
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,900
this podcast the first thing they'll say

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,639
is can you like send me something to

146
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,799
listen to so like I have an idea of like

147
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,900
what it's going to be and if you're then

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,660
like oh you know you're actually the

149
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,239
first person yeah people just stop

150
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,840
people stop replying very quickly okay

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,819
so I remember specifically I um at the

152
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,198
time Brothers Grim was like just

153
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:17,819
announced they were Reinventing

154
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,220
themselves I didn't know who who Duke

155
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,620
was yet I just knew Mr soul from like

156
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,479
reading online and stuff and so I

157
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,680
reached out to him and I was like do you

158
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,659
want to come on and he was like yeah

159
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
we'll do it send me some questions I

160
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,819
sent him some questions and then like

161
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,460
after a few replies he's like what like

162
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,620
um organization do you work for

163
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,099
and I was like oh it's like it's just

164
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,840
sort of me just

165
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,660
and and he abruptly stopped replying

166
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,638
sounds about right that's about right

167
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,960
it's uh yeah anyone who's met Mr soul

168
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,579
will know that's pretty par for the

169
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,000
course yeah

170
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:58,560
um so then again being a bit of a newbie

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,959
I reached out to Swerve of caliphon and

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,639
um a very similar thing he expressed

173
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,239
interest and then after one or two

174
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,740
replies just completely ghosted me so at

175
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,639
that point I was sort of a bit like I

176
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,780
don't know if this is gonna actually

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,500
happen

178
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,299
and I just started following Duke

179
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,000
because I'd seen on The Brothers Grimm

180
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,939
website that um you know he was pairing

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,620
up with Mr Soul yeah and I I just asked

182
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,439
a few questions in the comments I think

183
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,780
he had posted about some 88 G13 crosses

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,180
he had done and I just sort of said oh

185
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,098
you know I read this Line's pretty old

186
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,459
and it's a bit inbred do you find like

187
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:37,259
it dominates the crosses yeah and um I

188
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,939
think just a few questions like that he

189
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,819
was sort of like oh you know you seem to

190
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,978
be interested in the genetics yeah and

191
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,319
so yeah I just I floated the idea by him

192
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,818
and I think I even linked him some of

193
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,319
those opinion pieces and I think that

194
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,879
might have been what sort of got him

195
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,098
over the line a bit thinking like oh

196
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,538
this guy seems to you know it's not just

197
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,819
like haphazard you want to do it he

198
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,680
seems to be sort of passionate yeah so

199
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,379
yeah then we did that and that went

200
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,060
really well and I ended up we chatted

201
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,680
for a couple of hours and then we

202
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,079
actually ended up probably staying on

203
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,459
the chat for probably an equal amount I

204
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,719
think we chatted for like three hours on

205
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,239
the episodes then we'd probably spent

206
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,819
another three hours just chatting

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,860
afterwards about General stuff yeah and

208
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,379
you know we sort of developed a rapport

209
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,300
and at the end of it he was like I'm

210
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,099
gonna do you a favor and I didn't really

211
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,960
know what he meant I thought coming on

212
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,279
the episode was the fact that I was very

213
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,378
thankful

214
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,538
um but so I just went to bed thinking

215
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,459
that was great you know what a once in a

216
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:34,259
lifetime experience to talk to like a

217
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,000
professional because like at the time I

218
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,639
like you know I was just a nobody yeah

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,679
yeah and um yeah so I was really

220
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,278
grateful and then the next morning I

221
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,379
woke up and I had an inbox from skunk VA

222
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:49,080
and I'd never spoken to him at the time

223
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:51,299
and um in my mind you know he's this

224
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,420
mythological figure in a chemist story

225
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,699
very and he was also very inaccessible

226
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,579
at the time he wasn't online he wasn't

227
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,560
talking and he just basically said hey

228
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,379
you know um Duke said I should message

229
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:07,139
you and that was all it said yeah and

230
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:09,659
and uh and um so then we ended up lining

231
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,360
up the episode but a hundred percent

232
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:15,719
without a doubt those two things

233
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,300
happening was definitely the momentum

234
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,759
which allowed the show to continue in my

235
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:25,319
opinion yeah yeah I think that it was it

236
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:28,919
was a big get to get uh uh skunk VA on

237
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,320
for sure and you know that time yeah and

238
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,479
you know he He Turned he's a good he's a

239
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,879
pretty good Storyteller

240
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,000
um and he also told the truth about a

241
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,039
about a you know a lot of aspects of Kim

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,740
that were that people didn't wanted to

243
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,539
know so it probably sort of launched it

244
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,778
a bit I would imagine

245
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:51,419
yeah yeah hugely and I I think

246
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:53,220
um uh not so dog you said this in one of

247
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,379
the Breeders Syndicate episodes not so

248
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,240
long ago but you said listening to that

249
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,759
episode he was he was pretty honest

250
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,919
about a lot of things and as the years

251
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,080
have gone by and I've learned more about

252
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,939
you know the behind the scenes of the

253
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,278
various incidents he maybe spoke about

254
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,560
yeah I did sort of start to gain a bit

255
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,480
of an appreciation that like yeah it did

256
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,159
sound like he gave a pretty honest

257
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,259
recount and

258
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,360
um you know like there's a lot of funny

259
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,639
things not funny but um how can I put it

260
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,959
like people and you know not so you

261
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,879
probably deal with this a lot too people

262
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,759
still constantly ask me you know who's

263
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,720
the Staten Island guy yeah oh my God

264
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,000
yeah

265
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,680
yeah and you know what's a what's a

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,980
what's a bummer about that for me is

267
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,559
that because he shunned the spotlight on

268
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,180
the forums and anywhere else

269
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,119
um he's probably the single biggest

270
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,319
person responsible for keeping the chems

271
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,480
alive

272
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,640
right at least for that period of time

273
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,139
until he spread them out a little bit to

274
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,939
his friend group

275
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,379
um and he doesn't and he brought the

276
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,240
super skunk West

277
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,000
uh and he doesn't really get talked

278
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,440
about and he doesn't want us to say his

279
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,379
name

280
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,320
so I asked if Staten Island was like an

281
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,700
acceptable you know Among The Flume yeah

282
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
you know and he was like okay you can

283
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,180
call me that you know so

284
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,699
that's funny

285
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,919
yeah yeah you definitely and and as and

286
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,379
as I learned more about the story and

287
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,899
sort of the interplay between

288
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:20,399
um you know skunk ba not so dog some of

289
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,559
the other characters in the scene the

290
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,839
Staten Island guy I started to like

291
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,219
realize the story a bit more on the back

292
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,720
end and I was like oh okay this is

293
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,759
actually like really interesting and

294
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,339
yeah um I can understand the Staten

295
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,778
Island guys perspective and he's he he

296
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,100
always like you know obviously I've

297
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:37,019
never met him or spoke to him and

298
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,180
whatnot and I I know not so dog you're

299
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:43,500
you're very close with him but um yeah

300
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:46,078
they're smoking to him

301
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,759
yeah there you go but I just I just sort

302
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,919
of understood that he was from that Old

303
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,259
Guard which was like you know I keep to

304
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,240
the Shadows I do my thing

305
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,039
um so yeah that that was definitely

306
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,039
really interesting but I think that was

307
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,899
largely speaking how I got into it all

308
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,819
and then um you know it all sort of just

309
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,919
started to gain a bit of momentum from

310
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,200
there and we just sort of branched out a

311
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,539
bit really because everyone you know I I

312
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,879
owe a huge amount of um you know

313
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,500
appreciation and gratitude to to

314
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,480
everyone in the first ten because as

315
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,820
much as you know the first two I

316
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,259
referenced gave me some momentum I think

317
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,240
I have to be honest I think there was a

318
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,039
bit of a lull between episodes sort of

319
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,539
four to seven where I had some people

320
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,120
that I was interested in but maybe

321
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:31,379
weren't super super big

322
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,720
um right yeah definitely so sometimes

323
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:36,419
the interesting people aren't who who

324
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,040
like necessarily everybody wants to hear

325
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:41,278
about that moment but it's who we want

326
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,500
to talk to you know I feel you yeah but

327
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,838
yeah definitely people like yourself

328
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,399
um mean Jane and Bodhi and you know some

329
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,380
of the big name guys in the first sort

330
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,379
of 10 to 12 episodes which is hugely

331
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,778
impactful and I I honestly all the time

332
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,639
think about how different it would have

333
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:58,679
been if like I didn't have those people

334
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,320
including yourself you know I I imagine

335
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,539
I I look at a lot of other podcasts and

336
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,860
I see it takes a long time to get a big

337
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,139
following and I just think I was very

338
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,980
lucky to to get that sort of push

339
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:13,799
initially yeah you got some people that

340
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,259
the community uh likes a lot and some

341
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,879
people that were interesting and stories

342
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,399
that they wanted to hear

343
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,899
and I think that that probably had a lot

344
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,539
to do with it too

345
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,458
um I've always been super interested to

346
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,799
be frank and that the fact that you like

347
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:31,559
because our world is so underground

348
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,838
right there's like layers of what people

349
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,638
know about each other you know from like

350
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,139
Insider information that I'm sure like

351
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,299
as you've been in the scene now a while

352
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,220
you've heard a lot but when you're first

353
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,399
getting involved you typically only know

354
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,940
like Legends or public personas right

355
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,799
yeah and so even figuring out like who's

356
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,959
who

357
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,399
um can be I you know I always looked at

358
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,199
that because it's like it happened for

359
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,059
me like organically or Matt just being

360
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,100
around the forums being in the scene

361
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,319
living in California for so many years

362
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,899
like I knew a lot of these people in

363
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,879
real life yeah yeah you know but you're

364
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,320
on the other side of the planet you know

365
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,939
and you're trying to determine who to

366
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,339
talk to

367
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,339
um and uh you know we're a quirky Bunch

368
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:17,160
yeah how did that work for you like like

369
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,660
trying to slowly figure out like maybe

370
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,039
not necessarily who's full of [Â __Â ] but

371
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:25,259
who is more who's who's perspective

372
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:27,000
aligned most with how you see the

373
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,980
history going how did you start figuring

374
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,899
that out what was what were some of the

375
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,778
the

376
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:36,778
steps in stepping stones in that process

377
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:39,179
yeah what a great question I I have to

378
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:40,620
be honest I I'll I'm probably I haven't

379
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,698
actually super thought about that so I'm

380
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,379
just going to give you the ideas that

381
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,599
are coming to my head right now and yeah

382
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:49,439
yeah

383
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,778
um but basically I think that um I'll be

384
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,920
honest it probably wasn't until like

385
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:58,620
episode 40 or so that I actually was

386
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,599
able to stop viewing every episode as

387
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,459
like this real Fanboy thing in a sense

388
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,079
like I feel like before every episode I

389
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,458
would get nervous and it was like [Â __Â ]

390
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,979
I'm about to deal with this big name

391
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,018
dude and you know what I mean yeah so I

392
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,480
think um I just want to put that out

393
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,278
there that um yeah that that definitely

394
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,019
was the case I was a bit Star Struck

395
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,820
initially because you know as you guys

396
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,519
said you know these

397
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,620
um really Infamous figures online who

398
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,519
you just get little tidbits about here

399
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,860
and there I think largely speaking I

400
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,899
didn't have too many people messaging me

401
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,240
saying hey stay away from this guy there

402
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,458
actually wasn't too much of that except

403
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,519
except for my my name I believe that was

404
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:41,759
one of them you got a lot about nah not

405
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:44,278
at all not at all I I mean like maybe

406
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,159
but like [Â __Â ] those guys like

407
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:49,139
um like I I always view it as like I've

408
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,819
always said you know consistently that

409
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,899
your episodes are some of my favorite

410
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,300
because

411
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,980
I think that a lot of guests are very

412
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,740
diplomatic when they come on the show

413
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,600
and I liked the fact that it didn't feel

414
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,220
like that with you it always felt very

415
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,720
free-flowing

416
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,879
um but to jump back to the question

417
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,100
quickly for a second I think generally

418
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,720
speaking I just picked a few people in

419
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,500
the scene who I thought were really

420
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,240
stand out and then I thought if if the

421
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,698
guest I'm thinking about is sort of

422
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,039
friends or cool with these people then

423
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,419
they must be okay so I think that

424
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:25,259
probably would have been the guiding

425
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:27,179
sort of uh feature but also I have to

426
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:30,600
reference I was lucky enough to come

427
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:33,299
visit the states probably within the

428
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,980
first six months of starting the show so

429
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:37,019
I got to hang out with a lot of people

430
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,300
in person

431
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,799
um and I think that helped guide the

432
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,179
guest selection a little more but like

433
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,219
I'll be the first to admit you know

434
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,919
there are there are some episodes that I

435
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,540
think haven't aged as well as others

436
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,419
um and and there is a number of episodes

437
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:54,000
that are just not available anymore and

438
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:56,338
that's for a variety of reasons and

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
sometimes the guest has requested it to

440
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:02,820
be taken down other times we just viewed

441
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,740
it as inappropriate to keep it up

442
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,699
um so yeah I think that the selection

443
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,179
has gotten better over time I hope and I

444
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,740
certainly also think that I like to chat

445
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,199
to people a little bit before I get them

446
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,380
on the show and the other guiding

447
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:22,439
principle I have is that I don't really

448
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,939
take requests so much like people will

449
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,880
message me and say hey can I get on the

450
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:29,279
show and they might be like a decent

451
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,600
size following but I have always said

452
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,119
you know in order to get a good episode

453
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,480
I think I have to genuinely be curious

454
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,699
about you sure yeah yeah and if you're

455
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,819
not it's just like a stale conversation

456
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,980
you know yeah yeah I mean it's it's

457
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,899
really hard when it comes to to guess

458
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,819
like I mean

459
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,500
even with just doing the live streams

460
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,178
for a long time there are so many of

461
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,058
those that I look back on that did not

462
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,280
age well in my brain like I'm like wow I

463
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,619
was really friendly with that person and

464
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,538
later on I'm like wow I don't really

465
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,798
like how that went looking back but you

466
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,779
can't you know I mean you can only do

467
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,918
what you do at the time and and how it

468
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,399
goes at the time and how you're feeling

469
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:11,220
at the time and and I think like over

470
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,840
years and years and years you it's

471
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,759
easier to go easier on yourself about

472
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,980
the [Â __Â ] cops when it comes to stuff

473
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,359
like that because it's just so it's it's

474
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,120
possible to control other people's

475
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,519
actions and then I think I think my

476
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,459
opinion on it actually has dramatically

477
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,440
changed in the last few years

478
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,600
um I used to think about it where like

479
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,460
to be honest there was some people that

480
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:33,480
you you've had on I don't need to name

481
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,100
names or anything like that because

482
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,860
that's irrelevant where I was like ah

483
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:39,839
that person oh no but then

484
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:42,959
over time I think I've thought about it

485
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,000
and like I actually think to let people

486
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,460
really judge someone

487
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,798
it's really hard to [Â __Â ] for two or

488
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,500
three hours yeah like your interviews

489
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,839
are pretty long and like you give pretty

490
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,759
open-ended questions and you let people

491
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,639
talk

492
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,919
you know and when you talk that gives

493
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,600
the public a chance to see do I Vibe

494
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,520
with this person do I like what they

495
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,980
have to say do I get a sense of who they

496
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,000
are and in some cases people can't talk

497
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,179
the talk

498
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,038
yeah I remember it yeah and so that and

499
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,900
so that allows and I'm not you know good

500
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,940
or bad or whatever and so it just it

501
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,519
just allows like

502
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,980
um because our our our

503
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,079
scene is full of characters

504
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,940
you know there's definitely reasons why

505
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,038
people like to be isolated and growing

506
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,538
weed and not dealing with humans yeah

507
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,460
and you have to have a certain risk

508
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,200
profile and people get into cannabis for

509
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,120
all kinds of reasons

510
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,279
sure you know

511
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,479
um and so yeah like you give nice long

512
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,899
interviews

513
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,000
and you let people speak you know

514
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,740
um I'll I'll say this I I was one of the

515
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,660
people that gave you I think this is the

516
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,538
first time we butted heads was during

517
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,519
and I'll say it the sub cool interview I

518
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:55,140
was super pissed at the time and I've

519
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,038
told you recently like looking back on

520
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,840
that because Monty's no longer with us

521
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:03,919
like I am so glad you didn't listen to

522
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,418
any of us I'm I'm because because

523
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,038
regardless of whether me and him got

524
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,440
along or what happened

525
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,359
it none of that matters because he did

526
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,679
work it was it was important it was in a

527
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,619
lot of people's Gardens and those those

528
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,759
stories need to be there we need to

529
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:19,500
whether they're accurate or not or

530
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,759
whether you know he was right or not

531
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,319
doesn't really matter we need to have

532
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,940
those stories regardless and he was a

533
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,038
major part of the scene for a long time

534
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,558
so

535
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:31,700
on that yeah he he did and I was pissed

536
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:35,099
at the time but I mean

537
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,740
yeah I I just wanted to you know I like

538
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:39,839
now it's like even if even if it's not

539
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,400
somebody I prefer like I like to hear

540
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,379
what they have to say

541
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,400
sure you know because I'm always curious

542
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,419
about people's perspectives you know and

543
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,860
um you know and then there's an also

544
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,500
thing where like there's this huge

545
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,879
there's this huge gig to like

546
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,079
um you know when you were saying before

547
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,820
it's like there's a lot of people that

548
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,319
come on to be diplomatic

549
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:59,879
you know there's a lot of people that

550
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,200
are coming on that are trying to project

551
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,840
an image

552
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,400
and so it's probably really relaxing for

553
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,779
you sometimes when you get somebody on

554
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,820
and you just get a sense oh this

555
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,879
person's just being themselves

556
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:14,460
yeah hugely and it's I don't want to say

557
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,919
it's rare but I can understand like I do

558
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,720
it myself you know sometimes you've got

559
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,580
your own personal thoughts and then

560
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,500
you've got more public thoughts you're

561
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,599
happy to put out there but it is super

562
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,558
refreshing when someone's very upfront

563
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,959
and

564
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:30,240
um to sort of reference the the the

565
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,340
Monty interview you talked about Matt

566
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,900
that was actually a very interesting

567
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,220
moment for me because I didn't actually

568
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,559
I knew there would be some people

569
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,019
unhappy with it but I didn't anticipate

570
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:43,399
it would be to that level and I remember

571
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:47,339
uh old CSI left the comment

572
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,600
it's not like over a hundred likes I

573
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,359
think our whole crew probably said

574
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,279
something yeah oh it was it was yeah

575
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,500
I've never seen anything like that and

576
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:59,399
it was like to the effect of like this

577
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,079
ain't it buddy and um yeah I guess you

578
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,140
know sort of a related Point I've been

579
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,720
thinking about recently is that um you

580
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,480
know it's it's it's it's kind of scary

581
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,759
to think that three of the people had on

582
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,240
the show have passed away now yeah

583
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:18,000
you're not being Monty bog and Jaime

584
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,179
Chiba oh yeah great I forgot about I

585
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,579
forgot about part two yeah yeah and so

586
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:26,159
sometimes you lose sight of the fact

587
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:28,319
that like um yeah some of these guys are

588
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,059
a bit older and like you know

589
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,339
um as you said for better or worse it is

590
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:34,500
good to get their perspective on some

591
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,000
things and sometimes it's tough if

592
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,500
you're feeling like some of the things

593
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,558
they're saying might not be a hundred

594
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,200
percent true sure but um if nothing else

595
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,960
you know it's I I am grateful that I got

596
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,580
to speak to sub and interestingly you

597
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,340
know I never put this out there but it

598
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:52,619
but like from a technical level it was a

599
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:55,439
very interesting interview

600
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:57,418
um uh you know sub got a bit mad at me

601
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
throughout it and actually hung up the

602
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,340
call at one point

603
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,379
and then I think his friend told him

604
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,240
that that probably wasn't a good PR move

605
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,900
and he yeah he called me back and said

606
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,679
that there was internet issues

607
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,320
but

608
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,140
but like it was it was good to get his

609
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,480
take and you know I obviously you know

610
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,000
don't want to speak negative

611
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,620
um because you know I think we all can

612
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,538
sort of look at the last few years of

613
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:26,819
Subs life and and draw our own

614
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:28,619
conclusions but sure sub cool definitely

615
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,960
was the person who got me into growing

616
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,939
organically with super soil I don't

617
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,500
think Super soil is the best nowadays

618
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,240
but it was a great stepping stone for

619
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,240
someone who just never done Organics

620
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,880
yeah so so yeah for that reason I had a

621
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,140
bit of a personal like thing with sub

622
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,480
because I was like you're the dude who

623
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,400
got me in him and actually um you know

624
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,038
it was the Rev him and the Rev So I

625
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,960
listened to your episode the other day

626
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:54,900
yeah yeah yeah the Rev he was he was

627
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,058
great and I tried TLO and I had pretty

628
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,460
decent success with it and then I tried

629
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:01,740
super soil and I had pretty good success

630
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,240
with that and then I ultimately

631
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,940
um just moved on to sort of the more

632
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,298
general no-till you know it's it's it's

633
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,279
such a mindful these days but like yeah

634
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:13,500
um I I felt an obligation to sub for

635
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,819
that reason because he uh yeah he showed

636
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,919
me the Organics

637
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:20,038
you know anybody who came in during my

638
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,900
era like 2006 to you know all the way up

639
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,599
to

640
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:27,000
2013. like even me like Subways people

641
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,379
that I entered in seeing it was DNA but

642
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,720
once you got past like the DNA

643
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,020
Greenhouse like you know Spanish bait

644
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,120
and switchers you get into the Americans

645
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,859
sub was at the top of the game then you

646
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,959
know like all of us got into that even I

647
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,819
was inspired by him young um I have his

648
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,519
first book Bank you know like I still

649
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:46,319
have it so it was it was an odd fault it

650
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,000
was an odd Fallout when we when we had

651
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,619
our Fallout because

652
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,419
um I did respect him and I did look up

653
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,298
to him at the time and it was just like

654
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,700
I was I was his antithesis I guess you

655
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:58,740
know sometimes what I've heard is I've

656
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,720
gotten older sometimes just do people's

657
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,700
energies just don't match it doesn't

658
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,779
have to be a hate person or I hate that

659
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,179
dude or anything it's just sometimes

660
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:08,579
energies just don't Jive you know and

661
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,280
that's I definitely know what it was a

662
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:13,139
slight digression but they're connected

663
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,298
when I first started going over to

664
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,159
Amsterdam in the mid 90s and buying

665
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:18,359
seeds right and after I'd been there a

666
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,179
number of times I started getting

667
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,639
introduced to people okay and what I

668
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,860
realized was that everyone had their own

669
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,900
version of History some of these

670
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:31,079
Old-Timers didn't like each other and

671
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,820
there was significant beefs and it was

672
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,980
really Illuminating compared to today

673
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:37,678
because you know Matt and I talk about

674
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,919
all the time how you can pick any hero

675
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,538
from Neville to Shanti to Art to all

676
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,020
these different folks and you can kind

677
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:47,460
of tear them apart if you want right and

678
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:48,960
so people have their favorites or

679
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,840
whatever but there's a difference

680
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,480
between like lasting contributions to

681
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:57,959
the scene

682
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,519
and uh and and you know and being a good

683
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,900
person and someone you get along with

684
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,918
and someone who you agree with their

685
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,940
decisions

686
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,980
yeah

687
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,440
you know because those two things are

688
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,140
totally different you could make lasting

689
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,360
contributions to the cannabis seed game

690
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,960
and the Clones into the gene pool into

691
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,359
the knowledge and you could kind of have

692
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,460
a variety of of you know personality

693
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,939
quirks that aren't that cool yeah yeah

694
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,798
those things exist

695
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,980
yeah yeah yeah hugely and I think it's

696
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:31,500
only as I get more deep into knowing

697
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:35,240
people do you realize how deep some of

698
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,619
those uh divides actually run and um

699
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,778
something that's always lasted with me

700
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:41,158
is sort of this quote which was I you

701
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:43,140
know I can't tell you who said it but it

702
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,880
was like you know considering we all

703
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,860
smoke this plant that chills you out

704
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,080
there's a lot of aggressive unhappy

705
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,399
people in our community yeah I always

706
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,960
thought that was interesting you know

707
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,940
because it's you know maybe it's like

708
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,538
that with every Ultra you know maybe in

709
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,460
like the 0.01 of the craft brewing

710
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:01,379
Community maybe it's like that too I

711
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,640
don't know but like it is an interesting

712
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,799
point

713
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,960
I think you know some of it is because

714
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,480
we come from a

715
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,460
a subculture of like the cowboy attitude

716
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,558
of just like [Â __Â ] it we're here bring

717
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,240
what you brung like it's different now

718
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:17,278
it's there's obviously a big culture

719
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,620
Clash going on we have we have the dudes

720
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,960
who are isolated like to stick to

721
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,298
themselves move weight we don't want to

722
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,319
deal with tax stuff or anything like

723
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:26,460
that we don't want to deal with the

724
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,658
normal business [Â __Â ] it's why we're

725
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,840
doing what we're doing so we don't have

726
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:34,320
to do that kind of work and um now we're

727
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:37,139
merging with the the realistic climate

728
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,240
of legalization and it is a hard clash

729
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,340
of personalities plus we have two

730
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,759
different Generations uh maybe even

731
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:46,259
three or four in some cases apart trying

732
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,058
to work together or not work together

733
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:49,740
but it coexists in this same sphere and

734
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:51,178
it's it's definitely going to cause some

735
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,519
Strife

736
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,440
um I'd love to know how you navigate

737
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,079
that when you're doing a lot of these

738
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,058
interviews when when you hear when you

739
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,879
hear something that maybe you don't love

740
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:06,480
so much and you and you want to push

741
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,960
back but like what what what what is

742
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,298
that dividing lying for you

743
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,620
yeah great question and brings us to

744
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:16,200
something I definitely wanted to touch

745
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:18,178
on with the audience if it's okay with

746
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,519
you maybe I could chat a little bit

747
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,740
about our falling out and how that sort

748
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,960
of guided my view on um sort of the

749
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,220
question you just asked yeah it goes

750
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,400
with what we were talking about the

751
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,380
heavy beefs everything yeah yeah yeah of

752
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,640
course you know and and I can completely

753
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,600
appreciate

754
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,400
um that there may be some people

755
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,500
listening to this right now going why is

756
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,600
this guy on here I'm not a fan of him

757
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,759
and I can understand why you would have

758
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,079
that view so I guess

759
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,259
um the first thing I would just say is

760
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,298
like I didn't like so you know we had a

761
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,179
falling out probably about two years ago

762
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:53,400
and I want to take 100 responsibility

763
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,140
for that and the first thing I would say

764
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,000
is that I never wanted to really discuss

765
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,679
this publicly until I was able to do it

766
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,019
with you because I just didn't feel it

767
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,700
was appropriate and

768
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,038
um so I just sort of wanted to do it

769
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,500
with your permission so to speak so yeah

770
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:11,158
I think historically I always viewed the

771
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,079
interviews as like my goal is to get the

772
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,020
guests comfortable enough that they

773
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:18,480
share their inner monologue and then you

774
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:20,038
listen to it and then you decide so what

775
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,659
that would mean is sometimes people

776
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:23,579
would say things that I didn't agree

777
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,460
with or that I didn't like

778
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:29,639
but if I push back in the past they

779
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,798
would get cagey they would close up and

780
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,278
I sort of didn't know how to handle that

781
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:37,980
at the time and as a result I just felt

782
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,380
like it was better to just try to keep

783
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,058
them comfortable keep them happy let

784
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,380
them Express their inner monologue if

785
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:45,418
they say something that's really weird

786
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,640
hopefully the listener picks up on that

787
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:50,940
that was really weird sure yeah and um

788
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,278
we sort of go from there so sometime

789
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,380
about two years ago I had Gage green on

790
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,200
the show and I asked them specifically

791
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,360
in one of our prior episodes we'd spoken

792
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,419
about the Colombian black from JoJo

793
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,839
Rizzo yes yeah and I had said uh I know

794
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:08,399
that you and Matt both had those seeds

795
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,099
um he has said something to the effect

796
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,599
of you guys put them out cheap just to

797
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,639
you know sort of get it out there so it

798
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:16,980
wasn't valuable you know what's your

799
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,720
take on that and they initially started

800
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,298
out by giving this sort of long-winded

801
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,579
answer about how largely they try not to

802
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:25,740
focus on the negatives in their life and

803
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,240
it was sort of a diplomatic answer at

804
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,759
first and I was sort of thinking okay

805
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,579
this isn't too bad and then at the end

806
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,859
he just went off really left of field

807
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:37,259
and essentially made an extremely

808
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:40,259
inappropriate comment relating to you

809
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:42,778
and your childhood yeah and

810
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:45,000
honestly in the moment I was taken back

811
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:47,778
and I thought to myself this guy's a

812
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,179
scumbag and it's crazy he just said that

813
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:53,640
and in the moment I tried to voice some

814
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,380
opposition to that and looking back I

815
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,080
wish I had given a much stronger

816
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,720
rebuttal I believe I said something to

817
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,639
the effect of I can agree with most of

818
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,679
what you just said yeah yeah

819
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,000
um but I I want to acknowledge that it

820
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,778
actually it wasn't a strong enough

821
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,298
response on my part to what he said and

822
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:14,880
more importantly

823
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:16,980
um I just I didn't I thought that people

824
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,840
would listen to that moment and

825
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,339
basically go this guy's a scumbag you

826
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,319
know what I mean

827
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:25,558
um and I also thought that largely

828
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,359
speaking you and him had had you know um

829
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,339
conflicts in the past and it was sort of

830
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,918
just two people flinging insults at each

831
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:34,379
other however as time went by I realized

832
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,480
I had made not only a grave mistake but

833
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,840
one that I was deeply apologetic and

834
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,579
sorry about and I think the reality is

835
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,398
the simple truth is that there's no

836
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,319
place for comments like that on a

837
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,259
cannabis podcast it's just it's just not

838
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:51,119
appropriate and so I definitely want to

839
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:53,460
take responsibility for that going to

840
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,918
air I think that you know as the editor

841
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,659
of the show the buck stops with me so

842
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,700
even if I didn't say the comments myself

843
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:01,559
I have a responsibility because they

844
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,600
went to Air and that's under my sort of

845
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,099
leadership so to speak and I was

846
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,740
actually really grateful because it was

847
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:09,658
actually not so dog who messaged me and

848
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,460
he let me know some info that allowed me

849
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:13,559
to sort of reflect on the situation and

850
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,860
realize just how inappropriate it was

851
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,418
that those comments had gone to Air and

852
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,359
I specifically wanted to say you know

853
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:23,340
thanks not so dog because I always have

854
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,339
felt grateful in the manner in which you

855
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:28,259
approached me it was very humanistic it

856
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:31,439
wasn't like coming in hardcore like

857
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,179
you're a [Â __Â ] it was like hey just

858
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,860
want you to know it would be cool you

859
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:36,480
know and I I've always been very

860
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:38,099
grateful for that response and I thought

861
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,319
it was very telling of you as a person

862
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,599
that even though you know I I'd

863
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,879
essentially done something bad so to

864
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:46,500
speak to your buddy you were still um

865
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,679
you know kind enough to come in and give

866
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,859
me the sort of that gentle influence so

867
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,399
that I was very grateful for so since

868
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:58,979
that time I have been applying a much

869
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,538
more active level of moderation to the

870
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,640
show and this is sort of getting to the

871
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:05,398
Crux of your original question sure sure

872
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,919
which is that I realize that there just

873
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,839
is some things that get said that you

874
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,159
have to give push back to because the

875
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,500
reality is there's going to be some

876
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,620
listeners who just don't find what the

877
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,538
guest has said to be acceptable or like

878
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,219
maybe it's like insulting to them and so

879
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:23,278
you need to provide some amount of

880
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,259
feedback so these days I tried to I try

881
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,119
to provide some degree of feedback so if

882
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:28,679
someone says something I don't like I'll

883
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,418
try to come in and say yeah but like

884
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,700
what about this angle it doesn't seem

885
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,919
like you're considering that and I try

886
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,538
to give some degree of feedback but I

887
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,940
also

888
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:41,519
um apply like a sort of more active

889
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,860
level of moderation in that in the past

890
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,778
I literally would not take anything out

891
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:48,000
the guest said unless they asked for it

892
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:50,099
to be taken out sure whereas nowadays

893
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,359
there may be some things I'm like you

894
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:53,459
know what we're just we're a bit off

895
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,099
topic here maybe not appropriate or

896
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,200
relevant and so you get rid of it so I

897
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:01,199
think overall it's definitely a

898
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,460
continual learning process and you know

899
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,280
again I I sincerely apologize for any

900
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,398
um you know harm or distress that that

901
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,560
caused and I take full responsibility

902
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:16,019
and I I view it as a very big learning

903
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,719
experience in my life one that I'm not

904
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:21,480
proud of but I'm glad that I hopefully

905
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,118
have you know grown as a person and can

906
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,039
recognize that that wasn't right and I'm

907
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,539
not going to make that mistake again I'm

908
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,699
not going to let you eat crow totally

909
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:33,239
because you did try to reach out to me

910
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:35,098
and I just totally blew it off and I

911
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,739
think you know it took me a long time

912
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,240
over over because I I can't hold the

913
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,439
grudge if people that know me and have

914
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,819
known me over years know that I've been

915
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,159
all the [Â __Â ] Grudge like no one's

916
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,960
business but there were certain things

917
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,460
about that that I took very personal but

918
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,679
it wasn't necessarily from you it was

919
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,358
from it was because the dude knew me

920
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,039
personally and had personal info about

921
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,659
me and and the thing was that not

922
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,858
everybody listening knew that he because

923
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,599
it could have just sounded like a

924
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:00,659
[Â __Â ] mean slander at the time you

925
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,460
know but um yeah so it took me a long

926
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:04,440
time but when we finally spoke I was

927
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,880
very glad because it was it you know

928
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,920
that was heavy on me we were friends

929
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,240
like I had you out to our canaluma

930
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,700
naughty party because I liked you you

931
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:13,739
know so I'm stoked that that we moved

932
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:16,319
past it but I was mainly asking you

933
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:18,719
because I am learning that process now

934
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,440
myself you know like you had the podcast

935
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,939
I we started this way after and I'm

936
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,500
slowly learning like okay there's going

937
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,659
to be people that like I might have to

938
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,280
edit what they [Â __Â ] say like I don't

939
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:32,219
know where to draw this line and I don't

940
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,140
know like is it is it different between

941
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:36,659
each person like do you just try to draw

942
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:39,900
a line based on that person and how

943
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:41,639
accepting they are of certain it's hard

944
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,139
man it's hard and I've come to

945
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,940
appreciate what you've put together a

946
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:48,179
lot more a lot more being on the other

947
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,920
side and and so you you know I

948
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,838
appreciate the the apology but I

949
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,220
apologize as well because you know you

950
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,599
were reaching out you were trying to

951
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:57,059
communicate and I didn't communicate

952
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,859
back and really that's all it took so it

953
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:02,338
was always the The Shining Star trying

954
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:05,098
to like be cool with everyone and I you

955
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:06,900
know I I appreciate it for that I do

956
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:08,700
think it was very effective for a lot of

957
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,220
people it's showing them exactly the

958
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:13,078
kind of person that Gage green was yeah

959
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:16,019
you know um that's why I never asked you

960
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,300
to take it down to uh so so I mean it

961
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:21,000
obviously sucks you know in that regard

962
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,440
but I mean it and you know as far as

963
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,539
like me reaching out to you or whatever

964
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,220
like I mean Matt knows this very well

965
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,559
like one of the reasons why I'm even

966
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,939
public is I'm trying to build community

967
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,920
and culture

968
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,960
you know as sort of like a bulwark

969
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,260
against all the changes that are coming

970
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,280
and so like I try to like in on IG and

971
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,660
all that like you know when you

972
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,579
mentioned about like not just like

973
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:44,098
flaming you or something like that like

974
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,859
there's a lot of there's a lot of of

975
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:49,559
that kind of like like snippy back and

976
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:51,299
forth thing that goes on in public and I

977
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,940
don't think that's like particularly you

978
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,820
know conducive to anything positive so

979
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,440
you know I I always try like you know to

980
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,599
reach out and see if there's like common

981
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,099
ground or to like show someone your

982
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,200
point of view and maybe you can bring

983
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,780
them along and I always try to be open

984
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,699
to that as well you know

985
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,140
um because to me like being a good

986
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:12,719
person doesn't mean you don't make

987
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,940
mistakes or [Â __Â ] up it just means that

988
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,338
you try to learn from it and you try to

989
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,440
you know make amends when you do and

990
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:20,699
you've like being a good person is a

991
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,159
work in progress

992
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:24,838
and you know and and that kind of and

993
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,578
and so it's not like you never make

994
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:28,679
mistakes so you never look back and be

995
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:31,200
like oh man I wish I would have handled

996
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,819
that differently because that's asking

997
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,699
for Perfection Which is far different

998
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,260
you know yeah and I don't think you ever

999
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:39,239
did anything out of maliciousness that

1000
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,220
was a whole nother thing too it was like

1001
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,199
there's nothing mean like you didn't do

1002
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:44,879
it to be mean to me ever and I always

1003
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,039
appreciated that even when I was [Â __Â ]

1004
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,960
mean you're never [Â __Â ] mean back so I

1005
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,199
appreciate that dude because like I'm

1006
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,300
pretty goddamn mean look in all honesty

1007
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:56,539
I I think during that time period where

1008
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:00,359
we weren't chatting I just tried to

1009
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:02,519
appreciate that anything you said uh the

1010
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:04,559
feelings were essentially warranted and

1011
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:06,239
I I couldn't I couldn't deny you know

1012
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,299
that this person is understandably

1013
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,559
probably not happy with me and um I

1014
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,539
think that was part of the learning

1015
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,759
process and and to speak to not so dog's

1016
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:16,500
point I definitely

1017
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,180
um am a big Advocate and I try to tell

1018
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,119
everyone that you know that like before

1019
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:23,639
you go and rip someone's head off drop

1020
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,260
them a line and and because one thing I

1021
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,000
know for sure having had a bit of

1022
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,400
experience in like sort of the mental

1023
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,440
health field I've realized that there's

1024
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,599
a very common saying you're hearing that

1025
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,240
which is like always assume ignorance

1026
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,559
before like um maliciousness which is

1027
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,000
like chances are when someone does

1028
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:41,219
something to piss you off they probably

1029
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,480
didn't think about it hard enough to

1030
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,879
wreck you know what I mean it probably

1031
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,740
wasn't like any and and I've certainly

1032
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,039
learned a lot from that and that's not

1033
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:52,019
to try to you know take any um onus of

1034
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:54,059
what happened no no I definitely could

1035
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:55,920
resonate with that that sentiment that

1036
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:58,739
you know I I think our community would

1037
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,680
be a much more hospitable and friendly

1038
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:03,838
place if everyone just sort of tried to

1039
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,299
yeah exactly what not so dog said you

1040
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:08,099
know just message someone in private you

1041
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,900
know chances are they'll respond

1042
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,599
positively and say hey thanks for

1043
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,920
letting me know I'm sorry about that how

1044
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,660
can we make it better you know what I

1045
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,300
mean like generally speaking I've had

1046
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:21,299
that response from people yeah you know

1047
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,220
and I hadn't I had just completely

1048
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,180
blacked it out you know after that I was

1049
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:26,159
just like I'm not going to deal with it

1050
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:28,559
not going to deal with it and then a

1051
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:32,098
timehill episode happened I was like wow

1052
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:34,858
this is a good episode he knocked it out

1053
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,119
of the park so you know I mean you I I

1054
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:37,619
finally got to hear how much you've

1055
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,838
grown and listened to several other

1056
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,400
episodes since and I'm really proud of

1057
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,679
you man how far you've come dude it's

1058
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,740
it's pretty exceptional and the the Tom

1059
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,539
Hillman was a massive get and a huge I I

1060
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,159
think a huge achievement for the the

1061
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:51,659
whole Community because nobody had

1062
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,098
really ever talked to him for a long

1063
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,019
time and had him put all that down on

1064
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,338
record and you asked him some of the

1065
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:58,440
most amazing questions that anybody

1066
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:00,179
could have asked him so mad props on

1067
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,639
that if anybody hasn't listened to it

1068
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:06,598
yet go check it out

1069
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:08,699
uh you're too kind honestly if if any

1070
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,059
episode is strikes you as particularly

1071
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:14,519
good it's because of the guess not me so

1072
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:16,440
um you know all props to Tom for

1073
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,179
everything he's done in the scene and

1074
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,639
for being willing to share that

1075
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:22,139
knowledge and more importantly I've been

1076
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,019
I've been very adamant about this from

1077
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:27,900
the start I I wholeheartedly believe

1078
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:30,119
that you know you guys will be able to

1079
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,400
coax a whole different library of

1080
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,838
information out because you you can

1081
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,338
probably relate to this right when

1082
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:36,599
you're doing an interview often you know

1083
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:37,799
they say something and you're like oh

1084
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,720
that's interesting let's follow that

1085
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,180
trail of thought yeah and and like you

1086
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,578
forget to ask something else so like I

1087
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:46,858
think that there's so much stuff that we

1088
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,660
didn't get out of Tom that we do need to

1089
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:50,940
get out and I think that it's going to

1090
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,019
come out when you guys go and visit him

1091
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:58,139
oh Lord

1092
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:59,880
oh Lord I will I will disagree with you

1093
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:01,500
a little bit there in the sense I think

1094
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,660
you're being too humble and that

1095
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,619
interviewing people I think and talking

1096
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:09,539
publicly is a skill yeah you know and I

1097
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,039
definitely think that you know you do

1098
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,739
something more and more and more you

1099
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,059
probably learn what questions to ask you

1100
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:17,939
know you probably got better at

1101
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:19,980
researching the your subjects and trying

1102
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:23,159
to think of good questions that your

1103
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,900
your listeners might want to know

1104
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,399
um you know I mean I personally when we

1105
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,320
started doing the podcast I started

1106
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,660
listening for all the weird verbal tics

1107
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,039
that I had that I didn't realize because

1108
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,598
you don't realize you have them in

1109
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,219
normal conversation and you listen to

1110
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,619
yourself and you're like oh man I need

1111
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:40,259
to get rid of that yeah right and so

1112
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:42,119
talking talking in public is hard even

1113
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,760
if it's pre-recorded or whatever else

1114
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,858
it's like it's definitely a skill and

1115
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,540
being entertaining you know not even

1116
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:50,460
that like with cannabis there's so much

1117
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,380
like especially I mean you can interview

1118
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,720
a lot of people in cannabis that make

1119
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,039
seeds and it's even if you have no

1120
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,639
knowledge about reading it doesn't

1121
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,440
really matter because odds are either

1122
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:05,039
well go in and interview someone like

1123
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,200
Tom Hill is a whole nother a whole

1124
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,880
nother aspect because he's going to tell

1125
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,639
you you're [Â __Â ] stupid if you ask him

1126
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,579
a stupid question that makes no sense so

1127
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:16,259
yeah I know I mean there is there is you

1128
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:19,500
know it's guests are great and all that

1129
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,180
there's a big part of it if you don't

1130
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,039
know yet and you get the wrong guess

1131
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:24,299
that can be really catastrophic and

1132
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,679
that's one of those guests that could

1133
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,940
have gone really catastrophic if you

1134
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,980
didn't know your [Â __Â ] because he will

1135
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,539
call your ass out so I'm proud of you

1136
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,619
for that one dude it came out good it

1137
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,239
came out good and you and you remember

1138
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,140
to ask about the chemist and stuff like

1139
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:38,759
that

1140
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:41,460
so thank you thank you in all honesty

1141
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,339
um yeah Tom Tom's a great guy he'll let

1142
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,500
you know when you're wrong which is um

1143
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:49,380
uh a good trait I I enjoyed our chats

1144
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,300
with him and um you know he's a he's a

1145
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,099
cool guy I'm glad that we're able to get

1146
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,200
that some of that info out from him and

1147
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,480
and hopefully at some point someone can

1148
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,000
touch base with the chemist right that

1149
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,119
would be really cool yeah well there is

1150
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,420
there is a chance uh that you know he

1151
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,940
doesn't he doesn't live too far from me

1152
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,980
um yeah he lives he lives you know he

1153
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,800
never mentioned exactly where he lived

1154
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,800
on your show uh but he lives probably

1155
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,920
like uh on one of the most famous roads

1156
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,660
in Mendocino uh for cannabis growing uh

1157
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,720
I would literally call where he lives

1158
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:26,578
sort of like the Beating Heart of of the

1159
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,439
Trump of the Emerald Triangle

1160
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,660
um and he's lived there since the 80s so

1161
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,179
you could literally like I actually

1162
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:34,980
thought you did a good enough job uh um

1163
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,159
on a lot of the genetic stuff I was like

1164
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,639
man maybe we'll just talk about life in

1165
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:44,039
Mendo and growing up like in a

1166
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:46,318
subculture because like I live in a

1167
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,420
bubble but where he lives that's like a

1168
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:52,500
bubble within a bubble within a bubble

1169
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:54,480
it is it really is like I it people

1170
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,699
don't know how much that little that

1171
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,400
area that he lives in and what kind of

1172
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:01,259
world he comes out so the chemist is

1173
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,639
supposedly his neighbors so maybe if I

1174
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,920
end up going up there and chatting with

1175
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,659
him in person which he says he prefers

1176
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,019
like who knows

1177
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:12,118
um but there are a lot of old-time

1178
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:13,318
breeders up here

1179
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,660
um and that's that's one of the

1180
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,759
interesting things is because you know

1181
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:19,559
you you have a tendency which is very

1182
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,480
obvious like to interview people that

1183
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,059
are currently selling seats

1184
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,559
right like to be like a commercial seed

1185
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,199
seller right because those are the

1186
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,880
people that get their name out there but

1187
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,439
a lot of those people got their start

1188
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,838
from people that have never been

1189
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,940
commercial seed sellers

1190
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,920
right they took a bunch of that work

1191
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,440
even when you talked to Tom he was like

1192
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,619
you know most of Tom's most famous stuff

1193
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,380
is the stuff that he liked the best from

1194
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,760
the chemist stash

1195
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,220
and he just improved except with the

1196
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,720
exception of the haze you know um but

1197
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:53,818
the rest of it was pretty much just

1198
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:55,980
stuff that was he got from older people

1199
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:58,559
in the neighborhood

1200
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,940
um yeah you know and I think that's a

1201
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,920
big thing that a lot of people Miss

1202
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,780
where a lot of people think current

1203
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,980
breeders kind of come out of nowhere and

1204
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,380
they created all this stuff for

1205
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,440
themselves but they all had a starting

1206
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,599
material as well and a lot of times that

1207
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,220
we all stand on the shoulders of those

1208
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:17,640
who came before us

1209
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:21,139
and we just popularized certain things

1210
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,139
you know yeah

1211
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,059
I was just going to say something I've

1212
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,880
certainly learned which resonates with

1213
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:32,460
that is that as time goes by you realize

1214
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,140
a lot of the people with the big reps it

1215
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,838
may have been just because they were

1216
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:39,358
particularly vocal or loud you know what

1217
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:41,219
I mean like you're referencing they just

1218
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,179
they weren't putting it out there you

1219
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:46,379
know

1220
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:48,899
uh yeah I mean I will say that the skill

1221
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,539
set required to survive in cannabis

1222
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,539
during the prohibition era

1223
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:59,159
was very different than like the show my

1224
00:45:54,539 --> 00:46:02,039
face you know burner publicity this is

1225
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:06,059
who I am this is putting your name on a

1226
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:07,739
strain yeah you know was crazy

1227
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:10,019
like trying wanting to know people

1228
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:12,179
people to know who you were and that you

1229
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:15,300
were responsible or associated with this

1230
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:17,759
and so in America a lot of people that

1231
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,619
didn't actually create the strain just

1232
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,180
became associated with it because they

1233
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:23,358
were the first people to become famous

1234
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:26,039
around it yeah

1235
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,838
you know and a lot of people got scared

1236
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:29,159
and like you know you know hide in the

1237
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:32,940
shadows

1238
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:35,578
you know uh for a variety of reasons

1239
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,579
you know unlike uh the king of cannabis

1240
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:41,780
we saw Matt hoed up too long ago where

1241
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:45,359
is he where's our guy

1242
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:47,519
did you say that um they put out the

1243
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:50,639
like you know cookies is opening their

1244
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:55,199
own seed bank oh yeah you see greenhouse

1245
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:57,358
seeds in the tag yeah makes sense what's

1246
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,980
he gonna add like I really I genuinely

1247
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,920
want to know what's going to be on the

1248
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,699
menu that's his contribution well you

1249
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,119
know

1250
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:08,639
I I think like Ariane is is the

1251
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,680
Prototype burner for in the Netherlands

1252
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,219
so I'm sure burner could learn a lot

1253
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:15,000
from him when it comes to seed banking I

1254
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:18,480
mean

1255
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
for one thing uh cookies opened up a

1256
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,780
smoking Lounge I believe in one of

1257
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,039
greenhouses coffee shops in Amsterdam oh

1258
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,440
boy

1259
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,960
um and so the collab the collab if you

1260
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,960
will started early

1261
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,539
um and you know Arjun for all all of you

1262
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,338
could there there was a and it's going

1263
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:40,980
on in America now

1264
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:44,279
there was two camps in Amsterdam and one

1265
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,500
of them was uh sort of like the the weed

1266
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,180
history and the weed nerd camp

1267
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,699
and the other Camp was like straight

1268
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:54,000
businessmen who were looking to Market

1269
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:56,639
and and and and and make a lot of money

1270
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,719
and Arjun was extremely successful at

1271
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,179
the second

1272
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,858
he was an he is an extremely successful

1273
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:04,078
businessman he's probably the wealthiest

1274
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:05,940
dude in cannabis that's what I mean I

1275
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,859
mean he can teach Berner how to go get

1276
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,900
Spanish seed too to everyone to

1277
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:12,059
introduce him to you no longer have to

1278
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,980
use these front men like you know

1279
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,659
whoever they're using that for the

1280
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,159
smaller companies that are repping

1281
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,259
cookie stuff you can just buy direct

1282
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:21,539
from the Spaniards and here's the I'm

1283
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:25,140
sure they have a beautiful business I I

1284
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:28,619
bet I bet arjun's angle is that for 25

1285
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:31,199
years uh his town was the center of the

1286
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:33,300
cannabis seed universe and it's shifted

1287
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,879
to California so probably Greenhouse

1288
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:39,180
getting promoted by Cookie in California

1289
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,880
will probably Drive sales oh I'm sure

1290
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:44,039
and I'm sure their sales are far far

1291
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,858
down from what they used to be when they

1292
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:49,259
were the primary place you went to get

1293
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:51,179
seeds sure and then you know the

1294
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,900
attitude is popping up in the U.S now

1295
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:58,318
right you know who's running that

1296
00:48:53,900 --> 00:49:00,960
I mean I uh yeah I I uh Greenhouse

1297
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:03,239
probably Greenhouse coffee shop is

1298
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,579
probably the Prototype cookie

1299
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:07,379
yeah and look something that sort of

1300
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:10,859
jumps to mind when we're talking about

1301
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,960
this is that I I did want to try to slip

1302
00:49:10,858 --> 00:49:16,440
it in at some point in our chat is that

1303
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:19,679
I uh I really wanted to encourage people

1304
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,559
to consider their own personal

1305
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,480
weaknesses and and try to address that

1306
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,739
so as we've been talking right like

1307
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,260
we've just said you know Aryan and

1308
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:29,279
burner both great businessmen and we all

1309
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,480
know that there's a lot of great

1310
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,940
cannabis

1311
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,280
um people in our community who are maybe

1312
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,559
good at cultivating but not so good at

1313
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,619
the business side or maybe vice versa

1314
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:43,259
and I think that one of the ways we can

1315
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:45,119
stop everything going to [Â __Â ] long term

1316
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,060
is through yeah trying to encourage

1317
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,740
people who are like the heads the you

1318
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:52,199
know the guys who we align ourselves

1319
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:54,598
with to try to get a bit more business

1320
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:57,179
savvy you know it's always beneficial to

1321
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:58,800
try to improve your deficits and this is

1322
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:01,019
something I'm learning myself all the

1323
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,000
time is that you know it's easy to

1324
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:04,980
assume that like you know yeah I'll

1325
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,300
start the company and like I don't I can

1326
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,559
just do it you know you just make a

1327
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,060
website and you just you know what I

1328
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:10,380
mean and then when you start to really

1329
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:11,818
get into the business World a bit more

1330
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,800
you realize like hey you know I was

1331
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:15,420
actually selling those guys short

1332
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,940
they've got a whole unique skill set

1333
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,318
that I don't have at the moment and it's

1334
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,200
probably beneficial if I try to

1335
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:25,519
cultivate some of those skills myself so

1336
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,838
highly encourage people to like be

1337
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,539
self-reflective and consider your own

1338
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:32,400
personal weaknesses in terms of you know

1339
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:34,259
are you just limiting yourself to one

1340
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,358
thing and and you know listen to some

1341
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,800
audio books look at people who are doing

1342
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:39,539
it successfully like what we've just

1343
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,660
said you know plenty of people have

1344
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:44,460
walked this path before us and they can

1345
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:46,019
show you maybe some of the areas you

1346
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,720
could do things better in and that's

1347
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:51,420
certainly where I'm at in my life now is

1348
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,980
trying to recognize all of the areas

1349
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,500
where I might be a little deficit

1350
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:57,240
compared to others and trying to become

1351
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,920
a more well-rounded person because I

1352
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:02,399
think there's only advantages to that

1353
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,740
sure so here's a good spot for this when

1354
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,300
you when you got in into the idea of

1355
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:08,338
wanting to start making seeds and see

1356
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,380
your own creations and and see all this

1357
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:12,058
stuff you obviously were working with

1358
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,700
you know what you're working with at the

1359
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:17,220
time based on your your education level

1360
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:19,618
how has that changed now like what what

1361
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:21,179
where are you at in your your seed

1362
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:22,740
career now as far as what you're working

1363
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:25,739
with what direction do you want to go

1364
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:27,598
and how has it changed where it started

1365
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:28,618
yeah that's actually a brilliant

1366
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,059
question

1367
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,818
um because I think the answer is going

1368
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:35,040
to be a little counter-intuitive

1369
00:51:32,818 --> 00:51:37,739
um when I first started making seeds so

1370
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,259
this is actually before I started the

1371
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:42,358
podcast or anything I was just you know

1372
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,579
some dude in Australia just making seeds

1373
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,739
for him and his friends yeah and at the

1374
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:49,140
time I had already completed my

1375
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:51,719
undergraduate degree I had a dual major

1376
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:54,118
one in organic chemistry the other in

1377
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:56,338
molecular biology and genetics so I

1378
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,180
actually have a degree in genetics one

1379
00:51:56,338 --> 00:52:03,358
of the few people making seeds that do

1380
00:51:59,179 --> 00:52:05,879
but what I found was that besides the

1381
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,519
most basic principles it actually wasn't

1382
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,858
that applicable and I started to realize

1383
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,858
that I I didn't I didn't actually think

1384
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:16,558
it was a real credential after a while

1385
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:18,779
because for me for example the majority

1386
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,420
of people who have a degree in genetics

1387
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,880
or molecular biology it'll largely be

1388
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:28,139
focusing on human biology like you

1389
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:30,358
eukaryotic biology not plant biology so

1390
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,159
I think if largely speaking if you

1391
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:34,078
understand the principles of like you

1392
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:36,598
know Punnett squares and mendelian

1393
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,240
genetics you don't need to go too much

1394
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,099
further because when you do a degree in

1395
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,318
this sort of stuff you then move to

1396
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:45,180
humans and you start talking about you

1397
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:46,920
know proto-oncogenes and tumor

1398
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:48,899
suppressing genes and these things just

1399
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,838
don't exist yeah it's not applicable in

1400
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:53,519
bunny yeah for sure totally so I came

1401
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,980
into it thinking I've got this

1402
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,139
background let's see if I can use it and

1403
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:01,318
what I basically found as time went by

1404
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:04,019
is that like I don't feel like that

1405
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:06,779
specific quickly has made me any better

1406
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:09,059
I think that largely speaking the the

1407
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:11,400
things you hear our community commonly

1408
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:13,859
talking about are true I think that

1409
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,500
empirical observation is like hugely

1410
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:19,739
important just having experience making

1411
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,780
seeds looking at different plants and

1412
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:24,479
that's what I try to stress to people in

1413
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,579
Australia is you're limited by your

1414
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,139
exposure I have lots of people who

1415
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:30,720
message me in Australia and they say hey

1416
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:33,000
man I've got this super killer clone and

1417
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:36,058
I'm like have you ever tried a USA clone

1418
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,559
only because you might and be like oh my

1419
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:40,260
my client's actually not very good

1420
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:41,640
compared to this so and I say to people

1421
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,099
you know if you're growing your first

1422
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:46,139
ever plant you take a cutting of it by

1423
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:48,960
definition that's a keeper like you've

1424
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:51,719
got nothing else right so yeah yeah so

1425
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,699
as you get more exposure you get better

1426
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:57,358
so for me the thing that's helped me

1427
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:59,759
specifically is to just have had time

1428
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,980
making seeds popping them just sort of

1429
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,960
seeing what comes out but then obvious

1430
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,780
there's also the side of it which is

1431
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,818
like the the podcast and what people say

1432
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,040
how does that play into it I think

1433
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:13,920
honestly as time's gone by more and more

1434
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,960
I've become more in line with the

1435
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,900
sentiment that Bodhi expressed on the

1436
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,659
show which is basically that the proof's

1437
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,460
in the pudding don't judge anyone until

1438
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:25,500
you've grown their work and if it's good

1439
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,659
work then like what are you going to

1440
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,400
criticize you know make like I like to

1441
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:33,598
think of it as though we've got all

1442
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,280
these tools and the the reality is the

1443
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,200
more of those tools you incorporate into

1444
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,359
your repertoire it's probably more

1445
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,279
likely you'll have success but at the

1446
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,078
same time that's not to say you can't

1447
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,780
haphazardly make the next cookies

1448
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,880
because we can all point to various bag

1449
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,920
seed that have gone on to become clone

1450
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,980
onlys and they take the World by storm

1451
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,680
absolutely I think yeah it's great to

1452
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,179
have all those tools in your toolkit but

1453
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:58,980
I also think that you shouldn't limit

1454
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:00,480
yourself because you don't have a

1455
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,539
genetics degree or whatever you know

1456
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,338
like make some seeds like do something

1457
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:07,380
that you're passionate about and you'll

1458
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:08,759
probably find you get better results if

1459
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:11,338
you're Crossing stuff together just

1460
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,800
because you're like gel and Aid cross

1461
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:15,599
whatever is going to sell well like you

1462
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,160
you probably won't get too much out of

1463
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,440
that in terms of like fulfillment or

1464
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:21,058
experience like doing things you're

1465
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,700
passionate about going through the

1466
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:25,079
numbers and tying it back to What DJ

1467
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:26,879
Short said

1468
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,740
um you know the real way to tell if a

1469
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,720
male is good is to pop the seeds and

1470
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,058
find out you know that's the only way

1471
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,519
the only way that's to actually run the

1472
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:37,380
project yeah and and I think you know

1473
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:39,239
obviously you can be a good breeder it's

1474
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,400
not all like random or anything like

1475
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:44,219
that but I think that people shouldn't

1476
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,200
like trick themselves into thinking that

1477
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:48,058
they can't make something really cool

1478
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,699
because they don't have a degree in

1479
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:52,380
genetics or they don't understand this

1480
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:55,980
certain thing they don't have actual

1481
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,119
access to tissue cultured Cuts so yeah I

1482
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,858
just would really want to encourage

1483
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:02,280
people to get on board because as time

1484
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:04,619
goes by the more I myself encouraged the

1485
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,900
people around me to make seeds get into

1486
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:08,519
it it's fun it's it's what's going to

1487
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,039
keep you passionate over the long term

1488
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,920
and the more people do it with like

1489
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,719
honesty and and passion the better it'll

1490
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,000
help combat

1491
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:20,159
um you know stuff which maybe is

1492
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,760
produced from a more financial point of

1493
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:26,159
view absolutely yeah I mean one comment

1494
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,339
I'll add to that other than I basically

1495
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,078
totally agree with it is I you know I

1496
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:33,000
talk all the time about

1497
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,859
um there's kind of two sides to breeding

1498
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,619
one of it one of it is some like basic

1499
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:39,719
information but then the other is the I

1500
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:42,960
right and I kind of look at the eye as

1501
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:44,639
like the artistic side of it where you

1502
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,338
don't have to have an immense amount of

1503
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,920
technical knowledge to create something

1504
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:51,900
great you just have to have enough of a

1505
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,200
sense and enough of the eye and enough

1506
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:58,200
of being able to smoke and tell you know

1507
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,939
and and also on that you know it's like

1508
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:02,219
read what you like

1509
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:03,838
and you know the the best way to breed

1510
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:05,459
in my opinion isn't to grow what you

1511
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,440
think other people will be hot on it's

1512
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,179
more to like be like here's these two

1513
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,940
strains can I get things I like about

1514
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:13,558
each one of them in the same thing

1515
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,900
or maybe it'll give me something

1516
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,460
unexpected you know

1517
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,900
um and then on top of that too the most

1518
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,460
important part of weed the high is

1519
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:23,160
invisible

1520
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:25,440
yeah right so you can't actually see it

1521
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:27,480
you have to test it and you can't really

1522
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,099
test it with with testing you have to

1523
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,579
test it the old-fashioned way by

1524
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:34,559
consuming and then get feedback on it

1525
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:37,019
um and so I like that you came around to

1526
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,660
that side of things because uh you know

1527
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:41,699
when I when in Out Here in uh as

1528
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,318
cannabis is becoming legal you're

1529
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:44,338
starting to meet with a bunch of big AG

1530
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:47,338
people

1531
00:57:44,338 --> 00:57:49,139
and they just can't believe how

1532
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,400
you know I don't even know the term to

1533
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:52,920
use they probably think that the

1534
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,160
Cannabis gene pool is just nuts

1535
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,440
because they're used to Growing these

1536
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,480
strains of vegetables or fruits or

1537
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,639
whatever that have Decades of breeding

1538
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,699
out of all these universities that they

1539
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,098
bred them to be extremely like reliable

1540
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:11,219
to these certain traits there's all

1541
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:14,220
kinds of ibls all over the place and

1542
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:16,858
then comes this big crazy manic very

1543
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:18,539
poorly documented cannabis gene pool

1544
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:20,279
that doesn't do anything they think it's

1545
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:22,920
going to do and they're like what is

1546
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,380
this this is a mess right but to us it's

1547
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,940
beautiful It's A Beautiful Mess

1548
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,740
yeah you know but to them they're like

1549
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,380
how do I make an IBL out of this does

1550
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:34,818
the exact same thing in the whole field

1551
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,818
and that's what we're about

1552
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:41,039
it's funny you mentioned that because

1553
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,559
the Australian uh legal medical scene is

1554
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,838
is really starting to take off it's sort

1555
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:47,339
of only occurred in the past two three

1556
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,039
years but it's really starting to take

1557
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:51,659
off and I'm really fortunate that I've

1558
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:54,599
been able to be involved with a few

1559
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:56,039
facilities be it like consulting or even

1560
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:58,440
looking at maybe trying to get some of

1561
00:58:56,039 --> 00:59:00,539
my genetics into the facilities and the

1562
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,818
most crazy thing which relates to what

1563
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:05,639
you just said is that one of the

1564
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:07,380
facilities told me that they had spent

1565
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:10,500
Millions like literally 10 million

1566
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,420
dollars from the moment they started the

1567
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,880
company until the end of their first

1568
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,798
year of operation and it was because

1569
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,019
they hadn't been able to put out a

1570
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:21,480
single successful crop in that first

1571
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:24,298
year and they're paying overheads for

1572
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,740
this huge facility whatnot and it was

1573
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:27,960
basically because they said the first

1574
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:30,298
six months we had to teach our Growers

1575
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,760
to grow and the second six months we had

1576
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:34,619
to finohan and it was just mind-blowing

1577
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,240
it was like like you guys didn't know

1578
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:37,798
this is what to expect like they didn't

1579
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,838
under they thought like what you said

1580
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:41,400
they'd pop a seed it would be the exact

1581
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,139
plant they wanted and they were like oh

1582
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,780
you gotta hunt through this and then

1583
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:47,219
propagate the keeper up and then get you

1584
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,260
know what I mean it was it was very

1585
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:50,219
eye-opening that the big AG who had all

1586
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:52,920
this money

1587
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:56,279
seemingly had so little insight into the

1588
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:59,280
very foundational practicalities of like

1589
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,619
growing plants I saw that when I worked

1590
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,740
at the grapery and I was doing that big

1591
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:05,818
um them reversal on hipster and they I

1592
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:07,199
mean some of these are some of the best

1593
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:08,940
great growers in California that have

1594
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,379
been doing it 50 years plus you know

1595
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,960
like growing some of the best most

1596
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:16,559
expensive grapes uh sold in California

1597
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,240
and um they were shocked they they had

1598
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,519
no idea what to expect from Cannabis

1599
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,858
they didn't understand that the the the

1600
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:24,539
the lack of sex control that we have

1601
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:26,578
over the cannabis plant in the first

1602
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:28,858
place that is totally baffling to them

1603
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:30,539
that we can't control the sex very well

1604
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:33,539
through environment or spray I mean we

1605
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:35,940
can reverse it sure but like as far as

1606
01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:37,980
keeping it female and 100 non-staminant

1607
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,619
like they don't understand that because

1608
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:42,420
that's the sex sexual stuff isn't as

1609
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:45,119
plastic in a lot of their their the

1610
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:48,180
plants that they work with so yeah it is

1611
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,099
a whole different ballpark it's a weird

1612
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:52,019
plant it's a very weird plant among

1613
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:55,019
plants even you know it's not just weird

1614
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:58,759
uh from humans to plants but actually

1615
01:00:55,019 --> 01:01:01,679
plants to plants it's a very weird plant

1616
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:04,980
hugely hugely it's a different game down

1617
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:07,440
here and um yeah it's cool to see the

1618
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:09,240
medical Market opening up in Australia I

1619
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,880
would actually love to see like there's

1620
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:13,558
no surprisingly no one from America has

1621
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,480
come over here and like

1622
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:16,980
like just set up something that works

1623
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,440
because as it stands all of the

1624
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,659
Australian producers are not really

1625
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,000
producing a good quality product it's

1626
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:26,338
all sort of Mitzi and the only decent

1627
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,099
herb you can buy is imported from Canada

1628
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:31,318
and so you can already tell that it's

1629
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:35,039
not the best of the best right like yeah

1630
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:37,079
it's um so yeah it's very interesting I

1631
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,699
hope that someone comes and sets up a

1632
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,740
facility in Australia and just crushes

1633
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:43,679
it but um it's sort of yet to happen

1634
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:45,058
that's wild I mean there I mean the

1635
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:46,199
second Thailand to open up cookies was

1636
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:47,519
there so I'm kind of surprised that

1637
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:50,759
Australia just

1638
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:53,280
has been a I used to have a dream of uh

1639
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,799
being wealthy enough to avoid winter

1640
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,900
and so I would spend half the year in

1641
01:01:55,798 --> 01:02:00,358
Australia avoiding winter and then I

1642
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,579
used to see these grows posted from

1643
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:05,219
Northern Australia by people growing

1644
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:07,260
Neville's Haze outside and they actually

1645
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:09,179
had a climate that they could grow like

1646
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,799
these beautiful sativa plants and finish

1647
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:13,980
them without getting cold and getting

1648
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,599
ruined and so it's I I never really did

1649
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,880
anything serious about it but I always

1650
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,680
kind of had in this back in my mind oh

1651
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,059
maybe I could go to Australia one day

1652
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:22,980
and grow all these different plants in

1653
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:24,420
my backyard that I could never do in

1654
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,298
NorCal

1655
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:30,480
yeah please come on over

1656
01:02:27,298 --> 01:02:31,858
so so I know I know the Aussie fans are

1657
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,139
going to be super bummed if we don't

1658
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:35,338
talk about some of the the heroes from

1659
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:37,019
over there

1660
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:38,699
um yeah sure

1661
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:40,619
and Where Do We Begin where do you want

1662
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:43,858
to start with you have a much better

1663
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:45,720
grasp of it but please sure so I mean I

1664
01:02:43,858 --> 01:02:46,980
think for a lot of people the obvious

1665
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:48,838
thing would be like wanting to talk

1666
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,298
about like Neville or Shanti or any of

1667
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:53,519
that but I think in all honesty

1668
01:02:51,298 --> 01:02:55,318
um I actually actually listened to your

1669
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,239
episode talking about some of the older

1670
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:58,318
European guys and I think people should

1671
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,578
just listen to that if they're

1672
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:01,440
interested like there is so much

1673
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:03,298
information about the seed bank that I

1674
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,798
just didn't know that I got out of

1675
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:06,780
listening to you guys hash that one out

1676
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:09,119
so I don't think we'll touch on them but

1677
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:10,859
I'd love to touch on some people who the

1678
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,720
international audience may not be quite

1679
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:15,420
as familiar with but were like pretty

1680
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,919
focal people so

1681
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,838
um I think it might in fact be the

1682
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,358
people you're referencing not so dog but

1683
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:23,578
there's this crew called the Wizards of

1684
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:26,460
Oz and it was made up of two dudes

1685
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:28,798
largely speaking Wally duck who goes

1686
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:31,260
online by the name um Donald Mallard

1687
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:33,539
he's on icmag he's one of the moderators

1688
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:36,960
he's a very well-known dude and then

1689
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:39,239
another guy called Moon Unit

1690
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,798
yeah and then the third guy you're

1691
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:44,939
probably familiar with or heard the name

1692
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:47,460
of is kangativa so oh yeah yeah so those

1693
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,619
three guys are what I would consider to

1694
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,838
be like the

1695
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:54,000
the dudes who are sort of like me but a

1696
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:55,920
few years ago where it was like a a sort

1697
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,358
of notable guy you could point to from

1698
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,680
the Australian scene and largely

1699
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:01,380
speaking there hasn't been too many

1700
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:02,940
others but what they did that I love was

1701
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,280
not only were they growing like cool

1702
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,619
Thai stuff and the mum bimby Madness and

1703
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,079
all that but they're actually working on

1704
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:12,720
trying to make some unique hybrids so

1705
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,760
Donald Mallard is the guy who brought

1706
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:17,519
the duck's foot to the scene yeah and

1707
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,140
that's how he got that name and I've

1708
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,759
done an interview with him it's a sort

1709
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:23,400
of interesting story how it came about

1710
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:26,160
but he sort of it's not too dissimilar

1711
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,780
to ABC in fact sure he just sort of got

1712
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,659
it given to him and he was like wow this

1713
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:32,460
is a real mutant plant and

1714
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:35,899
um it sort of went from there but

1715
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:39,960
they're they're notable for doing the

1716
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:43,858
z99 hybrid so that's a cross of Zoid

1717
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:48,480
Fuel and an F4 c99 from the original

1718
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:50,940
Heavens stairway stock so what was

1719
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,880
interesting about that was is that the

1720
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:58,440
Zoid fuel is a super interesting strain

1721
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:00,599
it's made by Moon Unit on his own and he

1722
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,059
basically did what Neville said he could

1723
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:06,180
never do which was he he spun together

1724
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:09,059
three land races to make something that

1725
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:11,460
is like very representative or akin to

1726
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:15,240
Modern cannabis he basically took a

1727
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:17,220
Chinese Yuan a PNG gold and an

1728
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,739
Australian heirloom sativa so probably

1729
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:22,078
like an acclimatized tie yeah yeah like

1730
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:24,058
that he spun those together to make

1731
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,700
something which to me looks very similar

1732
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:27,780
to like an Amnesia Haze or something

1733
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:30,838
like that

1734
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:33,839
except the high is like a hundred

1735
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:36,358
percent anxiety from that PNG goal

1736
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:38,159
you know why when he was a homie he told

1737
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:39,179
me that was like the white whale the PNG

1738
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:41,940
gold

1739
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:43,798
yeah yeah you know what I've got a buddy

1740
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:45,960
who reckons he might have some I'll send

1741
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:47,579
it over because he he wants me to send

1742
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,019
some stuff to the states so we might

1743
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:50,400
look into doing that because I'd love to

1744
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:52,980
see people grow it out it's going to be

1745
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:57,358
a big plant man a big let's do a group

1746
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:57,358
project on it between the two podcasts

1747
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:06,659
anxiety isn't my favorite Buzz no not

1748
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:10,139
mine either but it's one that everybody

1749
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:12,659
misses and it usually ends

1750
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:14,879
it exists in weed and it is strange

1751
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:17,639
sometimes what different strains give

1752
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,338
people anxiety and others it relaxes

1753
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:23,039
them I find that very interesting but

1754
01:06:20,338 --> 01:06:23,940
yeah the 100 anxiety crawl out of your

1755
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,980
chair

1756
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,019
uh that's always an interesting

1757
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:29,940
description did you ever run into

1758
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:32,219
smoking moose much in your in your

1759
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:34,920
research in the Australian stuff I know

1760
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:36,719
the name I I do remember the name from I

1761
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,838
see mag did you have much history with

1762
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:42,358
him yeah he was on uh Mr Nice forums he

1763
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:44,940
was friends with me Wally and and uh

1764
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:47,098
Moon Unit and he was one of the guys

1765
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:49,440
that a lot of us like looked up to as an

1766
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:51,298
elder in the scene but I don't know much

1767
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,798
more about like his actual history in

1768
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:54,420
Australia but I know him and Tony

1769
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,500
mullaway and a few others are real big

1770
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,798
out there

1771
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:01,079
yeah do you have much info on Tony

1772
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:03,239
yeah he's he's still doing his thing

1773
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:05,940
he's been providing

1774
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:07,739
um like so I I've I've met him I think

1775
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,900
two or three times over the past few

1776
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:12,000
years just haphazardly not not at like

1777
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:15,660
events just randomly bumping into him

1778
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,780
he's um he's a he's a big dude in the

1779
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:19,980
underground medical scene in the sense

1780
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,559
that

1781
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:25,139
um he he would give medicine to really

1782
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,420
sick people yeah before like before you

1783
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:30,239
could really get it so yeah yeah he's

1784
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:33,900
definitely like an OG in terms of having

1785
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:36,298
provided a lot of like um RSO type

1786
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:40,200
medicine for people who are really sick

1787
01:07:36,298 --> 01:07:44,099
over the past 20 or so years yeah and he

1788
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:45,480
definitely gives out a lot of seed that

1789
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:47,160
um he says you know if you grow this and

1790
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,960
you want to make RSO it's it's going to

1791
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:50,460
be good genetics I'm actually not

1792
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,559
familiar with what the genetics he gives

1793
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:55,500
out but he is he is definitely a known

1794
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:58,260
dude he hasn't got online unfortunately

1795
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:01,920
there's a few guys like that yeah um and

1796
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:04,740
he's more of a like a a local Legend in

1797
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,240
like nimbin that sort of thing oh yeah

1798
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:08,219
nimbin's a bit is that like you're

1799
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:10,500
Humboldt out there

1800
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:12,179
it it is and it isn't so the the

1801
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,219
Australian scene is very interesting

1802
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:16,500
because there's a huge divide between

1803
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:21,179
the Old Guard and the sort of younger

1804
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:23,960
generation the old guys largely speaking

1805
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:28,199
they like smoking

1806
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:29,219
but they're they're also equally driven

1807
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:31,500
by

1808
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:34,198
um Financial motivation so like things

1809
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:37,079
have to yield well those sort of factors

1810
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:40,678
yeah yeah the younger generation is more

1811
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:45,179
indoor cookies hype that sort of thing

1812
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:47,960
so in nimbin you can get lots of outdoor

1813
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:51,179
stuff it'll be sort of

1814
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:53,039
thai-esque it's not unfortunately it's

1815
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:54,659
not like the tie you would hope you

1816
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:56,338
would get where if I said oh hey I found

1817
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:58,738
some tie and you'd be like oh [Â __Â ] Are

1818
01:08:56,338 --> 01:09:01,140
we about to yeah a once in a lifetime

1819
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:02,278
experience yeah unfortunately it's not

1820
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,199
that yeah

1821
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:06,600
um but it's just like what we would call

1822
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:10,678
Australian bushweed so the acclimatase

1823
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:13,140
tie yeah exactly it's Gonna Get huge the

1824
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:14,819
high is not as unique

1825
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:16,859
um but the yield's good it's generally

1826
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:19,380
uplifting and it's generally grown by

1827
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:21,838
guys who only ever had exposure to

1828
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,359
sativa in their life you know like they

1829
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:26,640
wouldn't have got Indica until like you

1830
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:29,039
know probably the mid 90s yeah yeah

1831
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,838
right yeah like like even way after

1832
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:33,420
California sort of thing when it was

1833
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:35,338
just super commercially available that

1834
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,600
was when they would have got it so a lot

1835
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,338
of those guys are just like die hard

1836
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,520
sativa dudes so you can definitely get

1837
01:09:38,338 --> 01:09:43,079
that at nimbin these days if I if

1838
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,880
someone came to me and said how can I

1839
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:46,019
get good weed in Australia or like they

1840
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,219
were like I want to come to Australia

1841
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,239
for a holiday

1842
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:50,100
um I just want to make sure I got like

1843
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,899
some good weed when I get there yeah I

1844
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,520
would say it's actually very easy to

1845
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:55,198
just find a good grower on Instagram

1846
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,460
from Australia and just be like can I

1847
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:59,599
buy a bag

1848
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,600
um yeah yeah

1849
01:10:00,859 --> 01:10:04,979
let me interject something before I

1850
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:07,260
forget right

1851
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:10,139
um so one of the things I was thinking

1852
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:12,539
of when uh when you were talking about

1853
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:17,579
the the differences in you know in

1854
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:19,140
Indica uh in America versus there is

1855
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:21,359
um you know because I bet most of our

1856
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:23,100
listeners don't know like in a place

1857
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,859
like nimbin or different places like

1858
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:28,500
that that had some weed culture

1859
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:31,198
um how intense was the police pressure

1860
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:33,238
uh in that area because really what I

1861
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:35,779
think what started the huge wave of

1862
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:38,099
outdoor sativa to Indica in California

1863
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:41,399
was helicopters

1864
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,739
before the helicopters it was all sativa

1865
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:46,079
and then as police pressure became

1866
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:48,658
incredibly intense they wanted bigger

1867
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:50,279
yielding thicker and most importantly

1868
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:52,979
earlier stuff

1869
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:56,279
but I don't know if that that would have

1870
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:59,158
would have happened without that outside

1871
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:01,259
pressure you know

1872
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:03,899
um so you know if you're if you're a

1873
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,480
bush grower as you were talking about

1874
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:10,679
um what's it like for those people

1875
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:12,839
yeah great question I I think there are

1876
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:14,699
some people who could tell you they've

1877
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,739
had to battle with helicopters but I

1878
01:11:14,698 --> 01:11:19,158
don't think it was on the scale of like

1879
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:23,639
Camp yeah and some of those notable

1880
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:25,679
campaigns in California I think that uh

1881
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,640
largely speaking a lot of those outdoor

1882
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,158
Growers

1883
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,260
uh that if I had to go out on a limb I'd

1884
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:34,679
say their primary consideration is yield

1885
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:36,539
and so I think the the acclimatized ties

1886
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:39,060
always just sort of out yielded

1887
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:41,399
everything honestly because if you're

1888
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:43,500
like where Wally duck is which is like

1889
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:45,779
the northern part of Australia you're

1890
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:48,539
basically at the equator and stuff will

1891
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:51,238
flower all year round that's amazing and

1892
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:52,979
so it was sort of hard to compare yields

1893
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:55,259
if you've got like a tire that goes for

1894
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:57,419
21 weeks and it's just growing that

1895
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,760
whole time and that's where you'd see

1896
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:01,699
those crazy photos of kangativa posting

1897
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,800
the Mullen man never forget them never

1898
01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:07,619
the old mother sativa oh yeah oh yeah

1899
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:12,000
yeah yeah old mother City's a good one

1900
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:13,800
and um yeah it's it's interesting there

1901
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,100
are definitely some guys outside who who

1902
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:19,800
grow um indicas and I and I suspect that

1903
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,840
they would have had luck with that but I

1904
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,640
think that like a lot of people who I

1905
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,440
speak to are interested in like sort of

1906
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:29,460
what Wally duck has to offer which is

1907
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:32,279
like I've got this z99 hybrid so like

1908
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:33,719
the c99 tames the anxiety of the Zoid

1909
01:12:32,279 --> 01:12:35,519
fuels because they didn't want to get

1910
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:38,039
rid of the sativa Edge they still wanted

1911
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:42,540
it to be like an uplifting effect but

1912
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:43,979
not so like [Â __Â ] yourself so the d99 is

1913
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:46,140
sort of what you're alluding to not so

1914
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:48,000
dog it's that shorter plant but it's

1915
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,619
still got that sativa high that they're

1916
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,560
used to because they grew up smoking

1917
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:53,880
Thai so I think that was sort of the

1918
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,039
middle ground and I think that is in

1919
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,600
fact why they made the z99 because it

1920
01:12:56,039 --> 01:13:00,719
was like hey this is like an indoor

1921
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:02,460
friendly really uplifting sativa strain

1922
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,399
that is a just a little bit more

1923
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,020
versatile I want to modernize Australia

1924
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:10,139
and start pushing Appalachia over there

1925
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:12,659
it's like to me to me it's like the the

1926
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:14,340
like what c99 kind of always pushed for

1927
01:13:12,658 --> 01:13:16,139
an early flowering something that had

1928
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:19,319
that really nice almost what people

1929
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:21,900
would typify as a sativa Taipei and um

1930
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:24,779
but fast flowering good density all the

1931
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:27,359
looks but just lacking a lot of the

1932
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:29,759
paranoia but still with the potency you

1933
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:33,119
know I'd love to get that over there I'm

1934
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:36,060
always fascinated by uh things and

1935
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:38,219
breeding that occur because of where

1936
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:40,620
you're at not necessarily what you're

1937
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:42,420
after you know and and so I think like

1938
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:44,039
for people like Sam Skunk Man or

1939
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:46,619
something like that or Rob Clark or

1940
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:48,779
whoever like breeding Colombians in in

1941
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:50,698
California in the 70s they probably

1942
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:52,439
would have stuck with them but they

1943
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:54,119
wouldn't finish yeah so then they're

1944
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:56,219
like oh I'll add this Mexican that's a

1945
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:57,899
little faster you know and then oh this

1946
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:59,520
is a little faster oh and then I'll add

1947
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:02,339
in this Indica that's a little faster

1948
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,300
now I have skunk one you know type of

1949
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:05,640
thing

1950
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,920
um and and you know in Australia like I

1951
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:10,260
you know it like I said like I can't I

1952
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,658
can't grow a 20 week in the Emerald

1953
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:15,119
Triangle you can't grow a 20-22 week

1954
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:17,219
stream unless you light depth it

1955
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:19,198
starting months earlier it just won't

1956
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:20,939
finish it gets too cold the Sun goes

1957
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:24,178
away sometimes it rains sometimes it

1958
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:26,059
freezes it just doesn't have the weather

1959
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:28,560
um and you know so without with with

1960
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:31,560
tropical weather and no police pressure

1961
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,480
like California might be a vast sativa

1962
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,000
land still

1963
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:37,678
um yeah because you know it it it's

1964
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,719
interesting how those things shift and

1965
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:43,440
it sounds like Australia didn't have the

1966
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:45,779
same intense pressures to shift

1967
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:48,119
yeah well I guess like the one thing I

1968
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:50,039
could say in relation to that point is I

1969
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:52,619
think another reason why the like the

1970
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:54,779
old mother sativa and those things fared

1971
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:57,420
so well was because for the longest time

1972
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:59,279
people weren't growing indoors so you

1973
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:01,800
were really limited by the conditions

1974
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:05,279
outdoors and if you're up like North

1975
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:07,140
like where Wally is the humidity and the

1976
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:10,139
temperatures are off the chart year

1977
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:12,119
round and so I think that lended itself

1978
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:13,860
to why they just kept growing the tire

1979
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:16,019
for so long because it would never mold

1980
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:19,079
even though the humidity is like 80 plus

1981
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:21,600
percent all year round yeah and um

1982
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:22,619
during summer the heat can get pretty I

1983
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,880
mean this is the funny thing

1984
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:26,579
historically people are like oh

1985
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:28,079
Australia gets hot it like the hottest

1986
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:29,519
it gets in California is the same as

1987
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,920
here it's just maybe we get a few more

1988
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:35,159
days of that here it's it's not

1989
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:37,079
particularly more but yeah just endless

1990
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:38,939
weeks of heat and humidity I think the

1991
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:41,039
time lends itself to that

1992
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:42,539
yeah I could see that

1993
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,760
I don't think people from America

1994
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:48,179
realize how different the climate is

1995
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,340
from say like Sydney and Adelaide and

1996
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:52,980
those places down there up through Byron

1997
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:55,319
Bay and and nimbin and then up into like

1998
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:58,500
the tropical North and then you have

1999
01:15:55,319 --> 01:16:00,119
this vast hot dry desert in the middle

2000
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,979
um that's very uncomfortable and then

2001
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:03,179
you get over to like you know I don't

2002
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:05,279
even know what the weather's like in

2003
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:07,440
Perth or like that kind of like isolated

2004
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:09,719
part of Australia

2005
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:12,059
um but yeah it's essentially Northern

2006
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:14,760
Australia is tropical right that yeah

2007
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:17,940
that continent is massive so yeah it's

2008
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:21,060
it's got a quite a diverse uh climate

2009
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:22,619
between it yeah so there's a guy in

2010
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:25,320
Australia he's an American dude he's

2011
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:27,658
from Oregon his name's Steve Solomon he

2012
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:30,238
um is one of the guys who sort of taught

2013
01:16:27,658 --> 01:16:33,479
coot and then like so he was like one of

2014
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:36,000
Coots gurus anyway he um he moved to

2015
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:39,119
Tasmania because the climate is the

2016
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,000
exact same as Oregon so if you look at

2017
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,439
Tasmania and start going up so like you

2018
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,060
know you'd say Melbourne would be sort

2019
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:46,619
of the next thing above Tasmania which

2020
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,120
is at the bottom of the Continental

2021
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:51,238
Australia

2022
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:53,460
um that might be somewhat equivalent to

2023
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:55,319
like Northern California so as you go up

2024
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:58,439
Australia you're sort of going down from

2025
01:16:55,319 --> 01:17:00,899
Oregon and there is some a degree of

2026
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:03,599
overlap in the climates not not 100

2027
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:05,879
obviously you know Oregon's like very

2028
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,560
humid and wet sort of place and maybe

2029
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,900
Tasmania is a little less wet but it's

2030
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,880
still largely speaking very similar so

2031
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:13,859
you can try to replicate some of the

2032
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,960
sort of micro climates but I think

2033
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:17,579
Humboldt and Mendocino you know they're

2034
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,840
their own special little egg I don't

2035
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:20,698
know if we have anything like that in

2036
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:23,219
Australia

2037
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:24,599
um and the only reason I I saw recently

2038
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:26,039
something that really helped me with

2039
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,820
that was that it was this map of

2040
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:33,300
Australia that made the weather patterns

2041
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:34,619
in relationship to places I knew from my

2042
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,840
from America

2043
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:39,059
yeah right and like you could be like oh

2044
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:41,100
this area is like this weather and this

2045
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:43,320
area is like that weather and this area

2046
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,820
is and I think that was like really

2047
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:46,799
helpful actually for me to like

2048
01:17:44,819 --> 01:17:50,219
understand

2049
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,960
um you know the climate differences yeah

2050
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:54,719
and all that because I do think like

2051
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,698
maybe down south uh you know where most

2052
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,960
of the population is probably is more

2053
01:17:56,698 --> 01:17:59,519
like California

2054
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:01,020
right

2055
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,480
um and

2056
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:06,000
um so you're saying like in uh in

2057
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:08,099
Tasmania maybe does the 45th parallel go

2058
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,319
through Tasmania I think it's pretty

2059
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:13,020
close hey yeah I think it's it's very

2060
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:15,539
similar and I know some dudes who do try

2061
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:18,600
to grow similar stuff Outdoors like I've

2062
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:21,479
got a mate who got some Jaeger s ones

2063
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,280
off Caleb yeah and he said they did

2064
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:26,519
really well so it's like okay I'm sure

2065
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:27,899
yeah I mean the the 45th parallel in in

2066
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,840
America goes through like Portland

2067
01:18:27,899 --> 01:18:33,658
Oregon right yeah

2068
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,579
um and and uh but obviously it would be

2069
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:36,420
the 45th North and you would be the 45th

2070
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:39,658
South

2071
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:42,119
you know yeah um so you know probably

2072
01:18:39,658 --> 01:18:44,579
like probably for you guys like Northern

2073
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:48,238
Australia is probably like something a

2074
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:49,800
little bit like Mexico but more humid

2075
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:53,339
and it's funny you mentioned that

2076
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:56,460
because I I did sort of wonder how did

2077
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:58,260
nimbin become this hot spot of Australia

2078
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,420
because it's it's not geographically

2079
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:03,600
quite in the right spot it's a little

2080
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:05,520
too North it rains a little too much

2081
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,500
for it to be like

2082
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,300
real like a lot of the guys who grow in

2083
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,399
that nimbing area like they're always

2084
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:13,020
battling like the first reign of the

2085
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:14,819
season and stuff like that so it is

2086
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:17,640
really interesting that it got set up

2087
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:21,119
there I think maybe the reason is that

2088
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:24,119
um it was a the police's priorities were

2089
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:25,738
a little less there but um yeah I'd have

2090
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:28,800
to imagine that somewhere down near

2091
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:31,019
Melbourne would theoretically be the

2092
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,699
better spot to have your cannabis Mecca

2093
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:36,239
of Australia because it's just colder

2094
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:37,979
the humidity is more manageable and you

2095
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,839
just don't have these prolonged hot

2096
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:43,619
periods you know

2097
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:46,319
yeah I mean I I think one of the you

2098
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:48,179
know I I uh one of the things that that

2099
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,219
um when I first read like for instance

2100
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:52,020
uh This is Gonna sound but DJ shorts

2101
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:53,880
book right

2102
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:55,679
um which is an interesting one but it

2103
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,699
had some tidbits that always stuck with

2104
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,319
me

2105
01:19:56,698 --> 01:20:00,719
um was he talked about how in different

2106
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,479
parts of the world there's just there's

2107
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:07,198
these cannabis regions that are ideal

2108
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:09,959
for certain types of ranges of varieties

2109
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:13,379
right and it just so happens in America

2110
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:15,000
that Humboldt uh and Mendocino County

2111
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:18,179
um and some of Lake County and some of

2112
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:22,198
Trinity are in this like sweet spot

2113
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:24,300
right where the temperature is nice and

2114
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:26,279
um like it's it's also like remote and

2115
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,199
hilly and away from authorities so you

2116
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:30,599
could kind of get away with it you know

2117
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:32,039
and it was dry as well

2118
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,719
um or at least dry and you know it

2119
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:36,960
doesn't rain in the summertime in

2120
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:39,899
California very very frequently so

2121
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,060
um it's interesting how now that we see

2122
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:44,279
legalization going on you see all this

2123
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:46,140
gear being put towards growing cannabis

2124
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:48,658
in all these places that aren't very

2125
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:50,880
well suited for it

2126
01:20:48,658 --> 01:20:52,379
yeah uh it is you know there's lots of

2127
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,239
places that it's not very well suited

2128
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,980
and but a lot of times you grow where

2129
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:58,439
you can get away with it

2130
01:20:55,979 --> 01:21:01,198
yeah you know right and so a lot of the

2131
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:04,019
most famous cannabis zones in the world

2132
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:05,698
are places that a are suitable and B you

2133
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,199
could get away with it

2134
01:21:05,698 --> 01:21:10,259
because you kind of have to have both

2135
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:13,139
you know yeah that's a hugely valid

2136
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:15,600
point I I definitely get that and I I

2137
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:17,659
have to imagine that there will be some

2138
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,039
new hot spots coming out of Australia as

2139
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:21,658
more time goes by and you know what's

2140
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:24,779
interesting as you said that you made me

2141
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:26,879
realize all of the facilities largely

2142
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:30,238
speaking that I interact with the legal

2143
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,159
ones they are down in Victoria and so I

2144
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:34,379
guess they've made the decision that

2145
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:36,658
like now it's legal like why why

2146
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:38,579
wouldn't you set up in the place that

2147
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:40,079
has the best environment for it you know

2148
01:21:38,579 --> 01:21:42,359
so I guess there's some four thoughts

2149
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:44,340
there there is one or two operations in

2150
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:46,738
that far Northern rivers that nimbin

2151
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:48,539
area and I think they're just having to

2152
01:21:46,738 --> 01:21:51,059
try to brute force their way through bad

2153
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:52,439
conditions with uh yeah you end up

2154
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:54,179
spending more money

2155
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:56,399
in order to grow the same kind of

2156
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:58,079
cannabis I mean uh one of the

2157
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:00,439
interesting things is that when I first

2158
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:03,359
started going to Amsterdam in the 90s

2159
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:06,299
almost all indoor technology is like

2160
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,219
trickle-down technology from their

2161
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:11,219
professional greenhouses that they have

2162
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:14,819
in Holland and in Belgium and in Germany

2163
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:16,319
because their climate sucks right so you

2164
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:18,119
know they grow vegetables like they'll

2165
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:21,719
have like a hundred thousand lights of

2166
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:24,000
cucumbers and tomatoes right and almost

2167
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:26,039
all of our indoor technology that we

2168
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,420
have that we use to grow cannabis all

2169
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:32,039
descends from that happening you know

2170
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:34,260
um where Australia

2171
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:36,719
or America is the same way they're both

2172
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:38,880
big enough that you can probably grow

2173
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,560
various crops where the climate just

2174
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,960
suits it

2175
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,840
right

2176
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,819
um and you know and and you know some

2177
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,100
some places indoors the only viable

2178
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:51,599
thing because the climate sucks some

2179
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,219
places you can grow maybe in a

2180
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,620
greenhouse but you'd have to have huge

2181
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:57,600
dehumidifiers and lights and all kinds

2182
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:59,760
of climate control because you're

2183
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,739
fighting the weather isn't isn't as

2184
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,659
ideal as you want

2185
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:05,279
yeah it's so interesting you mentioned

2186
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:06,658
that because that's literally all I've

2187
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:09,599
been thinking about in regards to

2188
01:23:06,658 --> 01:23:12,059
Thailand it's like it's so humid and hot

2189
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,400
over there you I I don't even know if

2190
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:16,340
you could produce high quality outdoor

2191
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:20,639
crops I think you'd have to do it indoor

2192
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:23,400
and like yeah I is it I I have questions

2193
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:25,140
about whether the logical answer for

2194
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:28,259
them will just be to try to import it

2195
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:31,079
because like it's just so costly to try

2196
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:34,500
to overcome this just strangling

2197
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:36,779
humidity part of the reason I think that

2198
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:39,179
uh part of the reason when you see some

2199
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:41,698
of those like Thai sativas and they end

2200
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:43,619
up being like wispy calyxes that are

2201
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:45,059
just like you know a Tremors Nightmare

2202
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:46,559
and most people would just want to

2203
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:48,960
eliminate because of what modern

2204
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,580
cannabis is supposed to look like but

2205
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,739
it's probably with that level of

2206
01:23:50,579 --> 01:23:56,158
humidity that's the kind of buds you

2207
01:23:52,738 --> 01:23:59,879
need to grow to not have it all rot

2208
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:01,920
yeah right and like the effect is like I

2209
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,779
also like the um I can't remember who

2210
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,520
said it but someone was like you know

2211
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:07,380
life at the equator it's sort of a

2212
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,239
little easier because it's warm than

2213
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:12,359
like up north and so it's interesting

2214
01:24:09,238 --> 01:24:15,899
how equatorial plants tend to be more

2215
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:18,658
like sativa and fun and uplifting and as

2216
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:20,339
you get North or South you get these

2217
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:22,139
more Indica varieties that are sort of a

2218
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:24,480
bit more medicinal and maybe it's

2219
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,800
because Life's a bit harder in those

2220
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:27,419
environments I've always been interested

2221
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,579
in like sort of what you're talking

2222
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:31,920
about like the environment as well as

2223
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:34,800
like how that maybe affected the type of

2224
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,000
high that was selected over thousands of

2225
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,779
years

2226
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,219
that that's a huge subject too and I I

2227
01:24:39,779 --> 01:24:44,219
think that

2228
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:46,260
um one of the reasons is that uh you

2229
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:48,319
know a lot of those sativas were bred

2230
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:51,239
for smoking the flower

2231
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:54,000
where all those indicas were bred for

2232
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:56,459
harvesting the hash the trichomes they

2233
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,219
were they were resin farmers and so

2234
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:01,140
Americans and Australia others you know

2235
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:03,179
it's it's basically you know when we

2236
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:04,800
started getting those indicas that we

2237
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:07,619
started blending them with what we had

2238
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:10,199
and smoking them

2239
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:13,979
um you know there uh there's a there's a

2240
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:15,839
funny story uh that uh uh Kamara tells

2241
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:16,859
about you know one of Sam's stories or

2242
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,239
whatever

2243
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:20,279
um about trying to get seeds in

2244
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:23,279
Afghanistan and he wanted flour to get

2245
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:25,380
the seeds and the warlord or whatever

2246
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:28,800
looked at him and was literally like you

2247
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:30,239
know women and slaves smoke flower men

2248
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:34,440
smoke hashish

2249
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:36,839
right uh and so yeah you know like uh

2250
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:40,319
the there they they didn't breed for

2251
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,340
smoking flour yeah you know yeah uh we

2252
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,799
did

2253
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:46,140
you know so it's it's an interesting

2254
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:49,260
divide the parts of the world that breed

2255
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:52,199
for resin and only smoke hashish and the

2256
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:53,699
parts of the world that breed for flower

2257
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:57,178
it's very different very different

2258
01:25:53,698 --> 01:26:00,359
selection pressure in my opinion hugely

2259
01:25:57,179 --> 01:26:01,920
can I um actually take this somewhere a

2260
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:04,198
little unexpected because these thoughts

2261
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,480
here I need my mind I want to ask you

2262
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:08,579
specifically not so dog what's your

2263
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,879
thoughts on Mendo breath because it's

2264
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:15,059
such a hugely popular strain and I think

2265
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:17,699
largely speaking the popularity comes

2266
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:20,639
from the Mendo perps that's utilized in

2267
01:26:17,698 --> 01:26:22,979
it and I'd be interested to know like do

2268
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:24,779
you look at Australian like that knowing

2269
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:26,099
it's got Mendo perps in it and that if

2270
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:28,500
you actually look at the Mendo flower

2271
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:30,179
now there's a good few characteristics

2272
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,619
that are actually you could say oh

2273
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:32,819
that's actually from the Mendo perps

2274
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:35,579
like the smell and the flavor

2275
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:37,139
specifically I um I'd be interested to

2276
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:38,939
hear like do you ever do you get

2277
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:40,199
invested do you like sort of track it or

2278
01:26:38,939 --> 01:26:41,939
are you just like it's it's not really

2279
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:46,198
my thing anymore

2280
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:49,500
I mean I uh you know there's

2281
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:51,960
I'm all I'm I'm like you know super

2282
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:54,060
interested in genetics and what passes

2283
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:56,880
down and what think and what things

2284
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:58,620
breed for right uh and one of the

2285
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,359
interesting things is because you know

2286
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:03,719
I'll be I'll be totally honest I don't

2287
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:06,658
think Mendo perps by itself is like an

2288
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:09,119
elite complete strain like it's THC

2289
01:27:06,658 --> 01:27:10,859
content and it's high it's like people

2290
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:13,559
that don't smoke weed a lot really

2291
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:15,719
really like it but if you smoke heavy

2292
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,699
Indica all day long you try to go from

2293
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:22,380
like you know uh pure kush or something

2294
01:27:17,698 --> 01:27:24,119
to a a Mendo mom uh it's lighter yeah um

2295
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:25,920
but it breeds really well and it adds

2296
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:29,039
color and it adds all these unique

2297
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:31,380
flavors and I will say that anytime I

2298
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:33,238
ever smell anything that I think oh that

2299
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:35,880
smells like Mendo perps

2300
01:27:33,238 --> 01:27:36,779
I turns out that it has Mendo perps in

2301
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,000
it

2302
01:27:36,779 --> 01:27:40,859
right and not to say not to say that

2303
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,380
Mendo perps has that unique and nothing

2304
01:27:40,859 --> 01:27:46,259
else does but there are things that are

2305
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:48,179
older that had smell profiles like

2306
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:50,760
people hunting for Super Skunk Aromas

2307
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:53,340
that have been lost right and are either

2308
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:55,320
rare or only found in one or two lines

2309
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:58,319
these days

2310
01:27:55,319 --> 01:28:00,599
um and so you know I think uh I think

2311
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:02,639
Mendo breath got popular because I think

2312
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,639
with IG

2313
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:08,159
um IG made everything that was going to

2314
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:11,699
be popular it had to be photogenic

2315
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:14,460
it became very hard in the Instagram era

2316
01:28:11,698 --> 01:28:16,019
to have ugly weed because you couldn't

2317
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,939
tell what it smelled like and you

2318
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,440
couldn't tell what it what's its high

2319
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:20,638
was like but you could tell what it

2320
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:23,279
looked like

2321
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:26,100
and Mendo breath is very pretty

2322
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:28,139
it's thick it's juicy huh I remember

2323
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:30,179
when it came out a lot of the popularity

2324
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:32,699
for it was because of the looks and a

2325
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:34,319
lot of the looks for ogkb at the time I

2326
01:28:32,698 --> 01:28:36,059
think the staying popularity and the

2327
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,920
reason people used it was because of the

2328
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:40,320
Mendo perks to be honest there was a lot

2329
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,300
of other ogkb offerings at the time like

2330
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:45,059
it was one of the later ones that that

2331
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:47,159
came out and one of the the last ones

2332
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:49,679
from the original era of the ogkv

2333
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:51,599
hybrids and it had some of the best

2334
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:53,639
pictures of it but I think it's staying

2335
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,920
power in lines was Mendo pervs because

2336
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:57,900
of the the terp content stuff like that

2337
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:00,420
that adds uniqueness to lines for sure

2338
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:03,119
that's a good question

2339
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:05,399
heavy days one of the things about that

2340
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:07,800
that for like someone who likes to know

2341
01:29:05,399 --> 01:29:09,960
like lineage and history

2342
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:13,199
um is that a lot of breeders like to

2343
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:15,899
obscure what where they got the sauce

2344
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:18,059
that they got to make what they made and

2345
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:21,479
so people generally speaking are not

2346
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:24,000
super honest about origin stories it's

2347
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:25,439
it's more rare than you would like

2348
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,179
um because they want to be like oh I

2349
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:28,439
made this famous thing and it's all my

2350
01:29:27,179 --> 01:29:30,179
my gig

2351
01:29:28,439 --> 01:29:31,738
they don't want to be like oh I took a

2352
01:29:30,179 --> 01:29:33,359
piece from here and a piece from there

2353
01:29:31,738 --> 01:29:35,879
and a piece from there and it blended it

2354
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:37,439
together and Bam I got lucky there it is

2355
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,600
right yeah and maybe they don't even

2356
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:41,399
like the person that the that one of the

2357
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:44,880
we the strains came from so they don't

2358
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:47,939
want to credit that person yeah yeah

2359
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,440
um and uh you know and so

2360
01:29:47,939 --> 01:29:52,138
um but you know good weed is good weed

2361
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:54,000
and so I do think that um Mendo perps

2362
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:56,880
isn't a lot more things than people give

2363
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,579
it credit for uh it's a shame that

2364
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,739
philos and others were unable to do what

2365
01:29:59,579 --> 01:30:05,039
they promised which is reveal family

2366
01:30:01,738 --> 01:30:06,299
lineages and ancestry genetically like

2367
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:07,619
that

2368
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,980
um but

2369
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:13,139
it is uh it is in a lot of things

2370
01:30:10,979 --> 01:30:16,439
uh and it Blends well with a lot of

2371
01:30:13,139 --> 01:30:20,400
things and um it adds color and a lot of

2372
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:22,678
Terps we're about to crack the F1 derb

2373
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:25,859
um whole whole thing around that right

2374
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:27,779
now and I I'm I'm putting my odds on

2375
01:30:25,859 --> 01:30:29,339
Mendo purpose being an F1 derp I haven't

2376
01:30:27,779 --> 01:30:31,500
really told him that but I'm putting my

2377
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,840
money on it there's there's there's

2378
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,639
there's been an aspect of uh people ask

2379
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,579
me sometimes on the lives to talk about

2380
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:40,260
the cookie story and I kind of held off

2381
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:43,139
because there's such a there's such a

2382
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:44,760
juggernaut of money and they have these

2383
01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:46,199
various intentions about being the

2384
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:49,260
biggest cannabis thing in America

2385
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:51,960
obviously so poking around at their

2386
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:53,760
story you know like they don't really

2387
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,579
care about the truth as much as they

2388
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,820
care about the pr of developing their

2389
01:30:56,579 --> 01:31:01,738
brand they have like a massive brand

2390
01:30:58,819 --> 01:31:03,299
right and so

2391
01:31:01,738 --> 01:31:05,579
um you know things that add to that

2392
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:08,760
brand are positive things that take away

2393
01:31:05,579 --> 01:31:10,920
or or whatever maybe not so much so the

2394
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,039
cookie story is a hard one to tell

2395
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:16,560
yeah um

2396
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:19,800
you know uh you know money gets involved

2397
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:22,139
in things uh and you know who created

2398
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,880
what who's responsible for what

2399
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:26,100
right yeah

2400
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,819
um when you interview him make him break

2401
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,820
it down for you

2402
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:33,060
we'll do that we'll do that I have to

2403
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:36,480
admit the reason why I was curious about

2404
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:39,360
the the Mendo purse question was because

2405
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:41,339
um it's it's exactly what you guys said

2406
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,158
um I like a lot of the work I'm doing

2407
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:46,739
now relates to this very special jelly

2408
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:49,379
breath clone I found and largely

2409
01:31:46,738 --> 01:31:52,138
speaking it's just a very Mendo breath

2410
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:54,000
dominant clone and so I've always been

2411
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:56,579
very interested in asking you about that

2412
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,139
because I like through trying this jelly

2413
01:31:56,579 --> 01:32:00,539
breath I'm like man this stuff's amazing

2414
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:02,039
but I can tell a lot of it's coming from

2415
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:04,560
the Mendo breath and I can tell a lot of

2416
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:05,939
that's coming from the Mendo perps

2417
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,560
um yeah it's interesting that's that's

2418
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:09,658
cool to hear the backstory and I

2419
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,880
definitely think that the Mendo breath

2420
01:32:09,658 --> 01:32:13,019
performed the best out of the OG KBS

2421
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:15,359
because a lot of people are going to put

2422
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:16,620
up an argument say Dosey does better I

2423
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,420
just don't think doci does better

2424
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:21,119
especially considering jelly breath is a

2425
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:23,460
cross of Mendo breath and do-sido

2426
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:25,380
um I'm very grateful it came out leaning

2427
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:28,560
towards the Mendo breath side the

2428
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:30,480
particular cut that I kept and um you

2429
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:32,940
know the other stuff like Grandpa's

2430
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:34,439
breath from um dungeon bolts like he's a

2431
01:32:32,939 --> 01:32:35,939
cool guy it's a cool strain I just don't

2432
01:32:34,439 --> 01:32:38,879
think it's quite in that same category

2433
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:41,158
as dosido or Mendo breath but yeah it's

2434
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,739
it's beautiful stuff man and and like

2435
01:32:41,158 --> 01:32:46,019
I've done a BX on it and I see more of

2436
01:32:43,738 --> 01:32:47,519
those sort of Mendo Finos coming out

2437
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,920
where I think they're a little less

2438
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:53,460
cookies looking a little more magenta

2439
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:55,440
and um a bit more cerebral high it's

2440
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,639
really enjoyable yeah how much of the

2441
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:59,039
train wrecks leaking through in that

2442
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:01,500
from the crystal locomotive that's what

2443
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:04,019
I always wondered and I have to imagine

2444
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:06,779
that the majority of the Mendo breath

2445
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:09,179
flavor you get is just from the Mendo

2446
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:11,579
perks because it doesn't strike me to

2447
01:33:09,179 --> 01:33:13,920
train wreck at all I've never tried it

2448
01:33:11,579 --> 01:33:16,738
the the Mendo I think that I think the

2449
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,600
train wreck gives the structure and some

2450
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:21,839
of the density and some of the crystal

2451
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,760
content and visible Frost

2452
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,100
um and I think the color and the perps

2453
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,619
and the and the Terps and the flavor

2454
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:30,360
profiles get dominated by the Mendo

2455
01:33:28,619 --> 01:33:32,639
here's one for you

2456
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:35,880
um the original line that was said to be

2457
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:37,739
used in the Mendo breath was supposedly

2458
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,840
key place that he created it but

2459
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:42,359
somewhere in my seat I have the original

2460
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:46,079
pack from JoJo of Mendo perps Crystal

2461
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:48,899
Locum so it did exist prior to key play

2462
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:50,460
playing with it that did exist and if I

2463
01:33:48,899 --> 01:33:53,698
have it that means a lot of people that

2464
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:55,319
knew JoJo had it wow so it does still

2465
01:33:53,698 --> 01:33:57,119
exist the original mother stock does

2466
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:58,920
still exist and is out there of that

2467
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:01,079
leading back to the Mendo perch Crystal

2468
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:04,020
locomotive pre-blackberry pie or

2469
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:06,359
whatever the age called it or keep play

2470
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:08,040
wow that's rad that's super cool man

2471
01:34:06,359 --> 01:34:10,619
would you ever want to pop him or are

2472
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:12,600
you just like nah I

2473
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:15,238
the last time I tried popping some of

2474
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,699
Jojo stuff was um a friend of ours

2475
01:34:15,238 --> 01:34:19,500
working man gave me some um pure Crystal

2476
01:34:17,698 --> 01:34:21,960
locomotive that he had and I was like

2477
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,238
yeah I'm gonna pop these right now and

2478
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,319
then I like right after popping him it's

2479
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:26,759
just screwed everything up and I was

2480
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:27,840
like [Â __Â ] I'm just never gonna pop these

2481
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:30,360
things because every time I do something

2482
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,920
screws up but yeah if you're ever if you

2483
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:33,359
ever want to run through them I know you

2484
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,760
like that line I'll send you out some of

2485
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:38,039
that stuff to try

2486
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:40,380
uh you're too kind you're too kind maybe

2487
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:41,939
I could spend a second or two just

2488
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:43,380
talking about

2489
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:45,500
um some of the stuff I'm doing but also

2490
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:47,520
some of the stuff in Australia

2491
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:49,319
go for it yes

2492
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,540
yeah like something I'm trying to do is

2493
01:34:49,319 --> 01:34:54,479
sort of help grow the scene and whether

2494
01:34:51,539 --> 01:34:56,460
that be like um you know trying to

2495
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,198
Mentor some up-and-coming people just

2496
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:00,719
you know help avoid make the mistakes

2497
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:02,399
and pitfalls I did or just more

2498
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,079
importantly trying to help put Australia

2499
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:06,359
on the map a little bit and just

2500
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,880
highlight the thing that I think is the

2501
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:10,559
real selling point for Australia is that

2502
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,060
and and you could say this about many

2503
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,760
countries

2504
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:16,620
um we don't have any USA clone only is

2505
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:19,020
in Australia no one has successfully

2506
01:35:16,619 --> 01:35:20,819
brought them over and these days I

2507
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,679
actively tell people don't do it we

2508
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:24,059
don't want the markets the whole plating

2509
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:26,579
virus like you don't want to be the dude

2510
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:29,520
who brought that to Australia exactly so

2511
01:35:26,579 --> 01:35:32,340
what I say is that the selling point is

2512
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:35,280
that there's a little bit less of that

2513
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:37,860
same sameness about the offerings

2514
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:40,380
because everyone has to hunt seeds fine

2515
01:35:37,859 --> 01:35:42,299
killer moms and I'm now at the point

2516
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:44,219
where I am confident that there are a

2517
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:46,560
few cuttings in Australia that could

2518
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:49,079
stand up to some of the cuts in the

2519
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:51,179
states sure of course you know there are

2520
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:53,219
some cuts that you know the chems the

2521
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:54,899
TKS like it you know I'm not talking

2522
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:56,819
about that that's the next level right

2523
01:35:54,899 --> 01:35:58,920
but like a lot of the stuff that's

2524
01:35:56,819 --> 01:36:00,299
commonly passed around is clone only is

2525
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:02,699
like we've got stuff that stands up to

2526
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:04,260
that and the cool part is it's from

2527
01:36:02,698 --> 01:36:06,658
people you know like you know there's a

2528
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:10,199
there's a Bodhi cutting the chemical

2529
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:12,539
easy so that's chem 91 cross 2 the 88g13

2530
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:14,939
hash plant there's a beautiful cutting

2531
01:36:12,539 --> 01:36:17,519
of that that goes around Australia it

2532
01:36:14,939 --> 01:36:20,698
won uh one of the smaller cannabis cups

2533
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:22,679
one year so really beautiful stuff I

2534
01:36:20,698 --> 01:36:27,359
think it tends to tap a bit more into

2535
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:31,020
the hash plant components yeah yeah yeah

2536
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:32,939
and it dominates yeah

2537
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:35,520
so also you know what's what's good

2538
01:36:32,939 --> 01:36:39,059
about that though is that the chem 91

2539
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:41,580
and I've talked about this uh before but

2540
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:43,500
um out of anything you know uh my uh our

2541
01:36:41,579 --> 01:36:46,198
buddy CSI is one of the most prolific

2542
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:48,539
breeders I know and he said there's

2543
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:52,859
nothing in his collection that passes

2544
01:36:48,539 --> 01:36:56,840
potency as consistently as the chem 91

2545
01:36:52,859 --> 01:36:58,738
cut which chem 91 was in that one yeah

2546
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:59,940
do you know which one was in the Kim

2547
01:36:58,738 --> 01:37:03,059
kisi

2548
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:04,019
uh is the 91 the real one because I

2549
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:06,120
remember there was two different

2550
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:07,080
releases at the cam 91 G13 hash plant

2551
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:09,119
and that's why I was asking I can't

2552
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:11,219
remember which one was named witch that

2553
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:13,260
one had one had the Joe brand cut that

2554
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:16,139
was a diesel and one had the skunk VA

2555
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:18,480
the skunk yeah yeah so I mean I just so

2556
01:37:16,139 --> 01:37:21,179
you know if it adds potency and the G13

2557
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:23,279
hash plan is pretty and Frosty and dense

2558
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:24,539
and more modern looking you know in a

2559
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:26,460
way then

2560
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:27,359
um you know chem 91 is some like ancient

2561
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:30,060
looking

2562
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:32,698
ugly Afghan weed that's [Â __Â ] ugly I

2563
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:34,080
don't care it's legitimately ugly you

2564
01:37:32,698 --> 01:37:36,238
know I mean I think it's beautiful but

2565
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:37,800
like you know it's kind of ugly compared

2566
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:38,779
to Modern weed

2567
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:43,380
um

2568
01:37:38,779 --> 01:37:45,059
leaves during stuff like yeah grows it

2569
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,739
beautiful I have no complaints about the

2570
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,300
way it's going he grows it beautiful but

2571
01:37:46,738 --> 01:37:50,819
I could never get it to perform like he

2572
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:53,100
does at all I just couldn't I mean

2573
01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:55,259
Staten Island he used to joke about like

2574
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:57,840
you know some some of the best runs that

2575
01:37:55,260 --> 01:38:00,900
we had with it every fan Leaf would do

2576
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,639
that and die before Harvest

2577
01:38:00,899 --> 01:38:03,960
and the bud the bud would still be

2578
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,760
beautiful but it would like you would

2579
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,939
just be like oh my God for the last two

2580
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:12,300
weeks of Bloom it's dying it's done yeah

2581
01:38:07,939 --> 01:38:13,859
it's eating itself oh no you know but

2582
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:16,199
then it would come out fire

2583
01:38:13,859 --> 01:38:19,619
so it's funny you mention that because I

2584
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:22,259
think most people I know say oh if you

2585
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:24,960
want like a real Benchmark for the chem

2586
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:27,420
91 like try some from skunk VA but I

2587
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,939
think in his mind he would say those

2588
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:31,800
early Staten Island guy harvests were

2589
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:32,939
probably The Benchmark for him in a

2590
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:35,300
sense you know what I mean so it's

2591
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:38,039
interesting you mentioned that

2592
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:40,980
what's funny to me about even though the

2593
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:42,840
chems aren't uh they weren't named that

2594
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:44,279
because they were they were grown chem

2595
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,760
it

2596
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:50,399
um they really do uh respond well like

2597
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:53,400
my uh Statin used to joke he's like it

2598
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:55,379
really likes GH you know it really likes

2599
01:38:53,399 --> 01:38:57,059
General Hydroponics three-part you know

2600
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,380
you can try all this organic this and

2601
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,179
that and everything else and it comes

2602
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:01,500
out pretty nice and then you grow it in

2603
01:39:00,179 --> 01:39:03,840
three part and you're like oh my God

2604
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:05,279
it's out of the park

2605
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,520
um and you know what's funny about that

2606
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:11,340
is he was organic for so long the reason

2607
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,800
why we all started calling it dog was

2608
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:16,980
because he wouldn't call it chem because

2609
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:19,920
he didn't grow chem wheat he didn't grow

2610
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:22,079
candy weed he grew organic in dirt weed

2611
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,658
so he couldn't call his organic weed

2612
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:27,479
chem so he called it you know he called

2613
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:29,879
it dog chem dog you know and that's and

2614
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:32,099
it's stuck in our little crew in Skunk

2615
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:34,020
VA and I see Collective and me and

2616
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:37,440
Staten Island I mean forever until the

2617
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:39,420
until really the forums it was just dog

2618
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:41,279
someone gave Joe brand according to Joe

2619
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:42,719
brand his story is that someone gave him

2620
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:44,279
[Â __Â ] because they didn't want to give

2621
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,960
him the real [Â __Â ] and he started passing

2622
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:47,340
it and didn't know that's his from his

2623
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:49,500
point of view that's how it was and it

2624
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:50,760
sounds like from talking to some of the

2625
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:53,039
other guys that maybe it was more

2626
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,900
intentional because Joe Brown's a little

2627
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,698
harder to deal with for most people I

2628
01:39:54,899 --> 01:39:58,738
like the guy he's a great guy no no

2629
01:39:56,698 --> 01:40:01,138
offense from my angle but like they they

2630
01:39:58,738 --> 01:40:04,079
had some troubles you know yeah yeah

2631
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:07,319
yeah I mean some of that stuff people

2632
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:08,939
want history and uh knowing a decent

2633
01:40:07,319 --> 01:40:10,559
amount of those people pretty well I can

2634
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:13,379
say that like what's a lot of what's

2635
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:15,480
been publicly told is true but then

2636
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:17,159
there's some interplay between various

2637
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:18,479
friends and falling in and out of

2638
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:20,759
friendships and different things that

2639
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:23,819
happen to different times and some of

2640
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:26,699
that has been I think withheld

2641
01:40:23,819 --> 01:40:29,279
um you know but uh you know and people

2642
01:40:26,698 --> 01:40:31,019
miss people mislabeling Cuts people

2643
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:32,819
going through some bad times in their

2644
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:35,760
life maybe and partying a little too

2645
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:36,479
hard and letting Cuts get out that you

2646
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,940
know

2647
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:42,000
um and so it never got lost in the crew

2648
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:44,879
itself but there's different individuals

2649
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,039
at different times that you know

2650
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,840
um may or may not have intentionally or

2651
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:51,420
not passed out things that ended up

2652
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:53,279
being quote unquote fakes it's how we

2653
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:55,199
ended up with seven kmds is what he's

2654
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:56,340
trying to say oh no I'm not going to hit

2655
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:58,198
that his mouth but that's what I'm

2656
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:01,260
saying

2657
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:04,019
yeah no I mean it you know Joe you know

2658
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:04,920
it's it's Joe Brand's a big partier you

2659
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:06,840
know

2660
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,399
um there was some chaos and and I see

2661
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:10,380
collective's Life at that point in time

2662
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,920
and like that's where my that's where my

2663
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:16,380
not so dog even came from was

2664
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,179
um him selling a a bunch of dog to

2665
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:19,619
Staten Island and he couldn't believe

2666
01:41:18,179 --> 01:41:21,420
what it looked like and I was like oh

2667
01:41:19,619 --> 01:41:23,460
it's not so dog

2668
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:25,560
um and so it's been it's been lost a few

2669
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:27,300
it's been lost a few times amongst it

2670
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,400
but no but no no none of the four of us

2671
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:31,560
ever all lost it at once yeah let's put

2672
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:32,939
it that way you know so it's been

2673
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:35,820
refurbished

2674
01:41:32,939 --> 01:41:38,279
yeah yeah and and you know and honestly

2675
01:41:35,819 --> 01:41:41,460
too it's like it took we all had it for

2676
01:41:38,279 --> 01:41:44,279
so long before anyone even cared yeah

2677
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:46,260
to you know to be to be clear about it

2678
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:47,939
too it's like before the forums and the

2679
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,320
internet and all that like it wasn't

2680
01:41:47,939 --> 01:41:50,939
famous

2681
01:41:49,319 --> 01:41:52,979
you know you know it just kind of

2682
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:55,138
touches back on the on the the tale of

2683
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:56,879
like you know there are some people who

2684
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:58,920
intentionally obscure stuff there are

2685
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,239
some people who you know whatever but

2686
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:02,699
there are also some people who genuinely

2687
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:05,359
are trying to get it right that just

2688
01:42:02,698 --> 01:42:08,460
can't for whatever reason because of

2689
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:10,019
past Stories being muddled and that's

2690
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:11,760
just that and that's where it's left and

2691
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:13,739
you can only correct what you can at the

2692
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,020
end you know but there there are people

2693
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:17,939
that are genuinely you know try to get

2694
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:19,560
it right and nail it and then something

2695
01:42:17,939 --> 01:42:21,479
comes out where it's like oh my God and

2696
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,400
and it's how they take responsibility

2697
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:25,198
for it and how they act with it like you

2698
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:26,698
know at the Kim 91 thing a lot of us had

2699
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:28,319
different chem 91 cuts at the time and

2700
01:42:26,698 --> 01:42:29,579
none of us knew we were all passing them

2701
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:31,799
to each other and we all thought it was

2702
01:42:29,579 --> 01:42:33,658
the same thing you know it's different I

2703
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:36,060
mean it can be hard like you want to be

2704
01:42:33,658 --> 01:42:37,799
historically accurate right sure but

2705
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:39,840
then you also because we come from a

2706
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:42,179
clan design society and like not

2707
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:45,000
everyone you know it wants to show their

2708
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:47,819
face or be Associated or have their real

2709
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,079
name no known with it and so in some

2710
01:42:47,819 --> 01:42:50,579
cases

2711
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:53,399
um you you know you're protecting

2712
01:42:50,579 --> 01:42:55,319
someone's wishes you know for the larger

2713
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:57,960
point of their life or in another case

2714
01:42:55,319 --> 01:43:00,118
you might be glossing over some things

2715
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:02,760
that aren't absolutely critical to the

2716
01:43:00,118 --> 01:43:04,679
history because it might paint them in a

2717
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,900
bad light or be personally embarrassing

2718
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:08,520
or not the greatest you know not the

2719
01:43:06,899 --> 01:43:10,198
greatest time in their life when they

2720
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,460
were struggling with something or

2721
01:43:10,198 --> 01:43:14,519
whatever and so you don't want to just

2722
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:16,500
put out gnarly details for the public to

2723
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,000
consume that might like hurt someone's

2724
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:20,279
feelings or something like that so

2725
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,380
you're trying to stay as accurate to the

2726
01:43:20,279 --> 01:43:25,198
story and as and history as you can

2727
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:27,679
without it necessarily being a grimy

2728
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:27,678
tell-all

2729
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:33,900
let's talk about what you're what you're

2730
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:36,179
working on now like what where what's

2731
01:43:33,899 --> 01:43:39,359
brought you to now what interests you

2732
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:41,760
now genetically yeah great question I'd

2733
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:42,439
love to delve into that so

2734
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,300
um

2735
01:43:42,439 --> 01:43:47,099
historically I was really and I mean

2736
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:49,320
even still now but I'll quickly cover

2737
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,300
the backstory on it but historically I

2738
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:54,000
was working with this strain that I

2739
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:58,500
called raspberry Mama it's essentially a

2740
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:02,340
phantom Kush F2 which is uh an offering

2741
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:05,639
from Ken's GDP okay and it was a cross

2742
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:08,400
of Pink Champagne to Ken's cush Ken's

2743
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:09,659
cush is essentially OG cross to sour I

2744
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:11,819
don't know how they got a mail out of

2745
01:44:09,658 --> 01:44:15,420
that but somehow they did manage them

2746
01:44:11,819 --> 01:44:17,819
they managed and um so yeah so Crossing

2747
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:21,300
that OG sour thing to the pink champagne

2748
01:44:17,819 --> 01:44:23,460
and then from that I bred it to the F2

2749
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:24,900
and tried to just steer it a hundred

2750
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:27,359
percent to the Pink Champagne because

2751
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:30,118
when I smelt that turf I was like man

2752
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:32,639
this is real interesting champagne

2753
01:44:30,118 --> 01:44:35,219
Pink Champagne is an unknown clone from

2754
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:37,319
the NorCal area it came out largely

2755
01:44:35,219 --> 01:44:40,319
around the time of About Cherry Pie

2756
01:44:37,319 --> 01:44:42,118
probably because cherry pie came out at

2757
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:44,340
the same time it stole the Limelight

2758
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:46,920
yeah it's very it's a very similar plant

2759
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:49,619
in the sense that it's a very sort of

2760
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:51,600
different Turpin profile like cherry pie

2761
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:53,399
in my mind is is quite a unique smell

2762
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,520
there wasn't too much at that time that

2763
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:58,259
smelt like it and it's got for me Pink

2764
01:44:56,520 --> 01:45:00,480
Champagne obviously has this sort of

2765
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:04,139
champagne component to it so like this

2766
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:05,579
sweet fizzy effervescent quality but

2767
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:07,380
there's but there's also like this

2768
01:45:05,579 --> 01:45:10,920
really nice

2769
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:14,159
um feminine perfume aspect to it nice so

2770
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:15,840
and and I think to me cherry pie is I'll

2771
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:18,719
describe it similar right like there's

2772
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:21,239
like this perfumey component and um

2773
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:23,460
anyway so I'm working with that and a

2774
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:25,379
few people from like um the Bay Area

2775
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:26,760
remember it and they're like oh yeah I

2776
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:28,859
remember you know Pink Champagne that

2777
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:31,860
was cool anyway so I'm working with that

2778
01:45:28,859 --> 01:45:34,139
it's an F2 and I'm doing my thing

2779
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:36,000
making seeds at that time I wasn't

2780
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:37,560
really putting out much I was still just

2781
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,560
you know doing my own thing figuring out

2782
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:42,719
the ropes and I eventually reversed it

2783
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:45,840
made some Femmes gave those out and they

2784
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:48,960
did okay but then I had to move and I

2785
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:51,420
lost the plan I I didn't have it the two

2786
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:53,279
guys who I had backing it up they both

2787
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:54,380
lost it thinking someone else had it

2788
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:58,618
yeah yeah

2789
01:45:54,380 --> 01:46:00,300
cannabis stuff right and um and so that

2790
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:02,339
was what then stimulated a bit of move

2791
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:04,380
on and start looking at the jelly breath

2792
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:07,260
stuff I mentioned however

2793
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:09,179
about a year ago a good buddy of mine

2794
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:11,639
and another breeder in Australia his

2795
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:13,920
name is feral genetics he's a cool dude

2796
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:16,618
he works with like land race Thai and

2797
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:19,199
Crosses it to like uh elephant stomper

2798
01:46:16,618 --> 01:46:21,118
and stuff like that like cool stuff and

2799
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:22,618
um he hit me up and he's like bro you

2800
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:25,859
probably don't remember but you gave me

2801
01:46:22,618 --> 01:46:27,299
a pack of the s1s you made and

2802
01:46:25,859 --> 01:46:28,618
um I hunted through them and I found

2803
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:31,980
something that I think you should take a

2804
01:46:28,618 --> 01:46:34,079
look at and so I went to his house and

2805
01:46:31,979 --> 01:46:36,419
um it was like the original the the

2806
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:38,760
plant I thought I had lost but it was

2807
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:40,679
actually better because the original it

2808
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:43,139
would just stay green it wouldn't budge

2809
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:45,020
but this one went purple so I was like

2810
01:46:43,139 --> 01:46:47,819
yeah this is like this is even better

2811
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:50,040
and so I've been working with that more

2812
01:46:47,819 --> 01:46:51,719
recently because it's come back and I

2813
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:53,880
guess what's interesting is from a

2814
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:56,158
genetics point of view it's like an F2

2815
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,260
S1 so that's a bit that's a bit

2816
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:00,899
interesting in itself sure

2817
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:03,539
um and then I recently did some

2818
01:47:00,899 --> 01:47:08,638
feminized crosses with that and so that

2819
01:47:03,539 --> 01:47:09,779
then made the F2 S2 yeah so again from a

2820
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:11,880
genetics point of view a little bit

2821
01:47:09,779 --> 01:47:13,319
different to what you might see I think

2822
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,520
it's I think it's very interesting for

2823
01:47:13,319 --> 01:47:15,960
especially like speeding up

2824
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,300
stabilization

2825
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:21,060
yeah well what was interesting was the

2826
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:22,920
majority of the original s1s did not

2827
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,539
come out like the mum so I'm like all

2828
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:26,760
right the mum is a recessive feed

2829
01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:28,920
exactly most plants aren't coming out

2830
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,139
like that so when this one was the same

2831
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:33,980
I'm like oh [Â __Â ] that means both

2832
01:47:31,139 --> 01:47:37,380
recessives have lined up in this one

2833
01:47:33,979 --> 01:47:38,819
yeah and it can only possibly pass on

2834
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:40,618
the recessive trait which means

2835
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:42,420
theoretically most of The Offspring

2836
01:47:40,618 --> 01:47:45,179
should come out with these sort of

2837
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:46,739
traits and not be like like the s1s

2838
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:48,840
exactly so yeah so I've definitely been

2839
01:47:46,738 --> 01:47:51,118
interested by that and then at the same

2840
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,760
time I'm also working

2841
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:56,880
um the the JB clone into a seed line and

2842
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:58,800
what I did was I initially made so I got

2843
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,300
this jelly breath clone and and you just

2844
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:02,579
may as well think about it as a cookies

2845
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:03,600
thing right it's just easy but it's

2846
01:48:02,579 --> 01:48:05,340
cookies

2847
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,940
um so I crossed that to this strain I

2848
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:10,380
got from duke which was chem D his chemd

2849
01:48:08,939 --> 01:48:12,238
I know there's discussion around that

2850
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:15,239
but I'll just quickly move on

2851
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:19,039
um his chemd across to Local H and the

2852
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:22,259
Local H is is um Sour Diesel cross to

2853
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:23,579
diesel slash cuttlefish hash plants so

2854
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,739
this I remember a cuttlefish I remember

2855
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:27,179
that one I made s1s of it a long time

2856
01:48:25,738 --> 01:48:28,259
ago oh actually it was a Black Russian

2857
01:48:27,179 --> 01:48:29,819
cuttlefish

2858
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:32,400
that's cool man because like no one

2859
01:48:29,819 --> 01:48:33,559
really worked with it right no so sunny

2860
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:37,219
and me

2861
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:41,580
yeah so yeah so I crossed this chemd

2862
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:44,039
Sour Diesel sort of hybridy plant to the

2863
01:48:41,579 --> 01:48:45,539
the cookies and I ended up like there

2864
01:48:44,039 --> 01:48:47,399
was clear like I'm not going to take

2865
01:48:45,539 --> 01:48:49,920
credit for it it was clearly just

2866
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:52,198
something about those two strains which

2867
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,760
just really clicked yeah like it's it's

2868
01:48:52,198 --> 01:48:56,099
not it's not me I'm not taking credit

2869
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:59,820
these two lines were just meant to cross

2870
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:02,460
together because I did a 40 female hunt

2871
01:48:59,819 --> 01:49:04,679
of these seeds and I found like eight

2872
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:06,000
Keepers I was so surprised and I was

2873
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:08,340
like man I've got to whittle these down

2874
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,960
to just like two or something yeah and

2875
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:11,520
for the life of me I ended up just sort

2876
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,618
of being like you know what these these

2877
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:16,739
plants are different and they really do

2878
01:49:13,618 --> 01:49:18,960
stand on their own feet so that's been

2879
01:49:16,738 --> 01:49:21,539
really cool recently to be really trying

2880
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,939
actively to disseminate those clones out

2881
01:49:21,539 --> 01:49:26,158
into Australia yeah and a lot of people

2882
01:49:23,939 --> 01:49:27,479
come back to me and say dude this is the

2883
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:29,158
first thing I grow where I feel like

2884
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:30,779
it's on par with Cal California and

2885
01:49:29,158 --> 01:49:32,339
stuff in terms of like just it's just

2886
01:49:30,779 --> 01:49:33,960
the genetics it's not like me it's like

2887
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,579
just that's how it happens sometimes

2888
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:37,380
where like that zipper lines up

2889
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:39,899
perfectly and everything just matches

2890
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:42,840
it's just how it works it's great yeah

2891
01:49:39,899 --> 01:49:44,819
totally so I used that strain which I

2892
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:46,739
call dog jelly

2893
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:49,259
um and I cross that and I use that as

2894
01:49:46,738 --> 01:49:51,000
the initial mail stock to then start

2895
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:54,840
doing the back cross onto the jelly

2896
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:57,060
breath so I then did the bx1 and that

2897
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:59,039
was great it came out very potent it

2898
01:49:57,060 --> 01:50:00,659
fixed up a number of the issues that I

2899
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:02,158
had with my jelly breath clone which was

2900
01:50:00,658 --> 01:50:05,399
like all Cookie strains it's a little

2901
01:50:02,158 --> 01:50:07,618
less urine than you'd like and um a

2902
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:09,359
little more prone to mold than you might

2903
01:50:07,618 --> 01:50:12,079
like because you know those little golf

2904
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:16,319
ball dense nugs anyway

2905
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:20,219
yeah so it fixed up that and um as a

2906
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:21,599
result I'm now just about finished I

2907
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:24,420
don't know if you can see it that's my

2908
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:26,039
little tent there I uh I have a bunch of

2909
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:29,158
seeded plants in there it's just the

2910
01:50:26,039 --> 01:50:32,399
little tent for seeded pollinations and

2911
01:50:29,158 --> 01:50:33,779
um yeah I got the bx2s being they're in

2912
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:35,819
the oven you know the plants are seated

2913
01:50:33,779 --> 01:50:37,439
they're just developing so that's sort

2914
01:50:35,819 --> 01:50:39,299
of largely what I'm doing at the moment

2915
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:41,638
and I think it's interesting because

2916
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:43,320
it's a pretty stable seed line as far as

2917
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:45,239
like a high quality cookies sort of

2918
01:50:43,319 --> 01:50:47,460
offering because in the past when I had

2919
01:50:45,238 --> 01:50:49,738
bought cookies hybrids admittedly

2920
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:51,060
probably from some less than reputable

2921
01:50:49,738 --> 01:50:52,500
breeders

2922
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:54,060
um I just they're all all over the place

2923
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:56,880
you know I could never get like a

2924
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:59,219
cookies type plan until I had this jelly

2925
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,679
breath really so that's sort of what I'm

2926
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:03,000
doing at the moment but the next cycle I

2927
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:05,520
do because I'm about to head over to the

2928
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,260
states come hang out with y'all yeah and

2929
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:09,900
um when I get back I want to do a big

2930
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:13,380
sativa hunt that's where my pumpkin lies

2931
01:51:09,899 --> 01:51:15,118
so Keen to do some sativa work and um

2932
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:18,480
one of the strains I'm going to be

2933
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:20,880
chucking in there not super sativa but

2934
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:24,718
um I've got a pack of

2935
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:26,760
Matt riots foreplay oh wow oh wow dude

2936
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:29,520
that so not many people got those that

2937
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:32,219
was the um the the Fairfax four-way cut

2938
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,500
by the elite guys that is a special

2939
01:51:32,219 --> 01:51:35,760
[Â __Â ] clone dude like I only got to

2940
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,800
see it expressed really well once

2941
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:39,719
because it it definitely had some kind

2942
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,760
of something but

2943
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:43,380
um we never saw it past any progeny and

2944
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,539
those things that was a skunky plant

2945
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:48,480
dude uh hempaling those guys are right

2946
01:51:45,539 --> 01:51:51,060
that is a very special plant that's cool

2947
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:53,759
Yeah man so I'm excited to do that when

2948
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:55,920
I get back get some um some fun stuff in

2949
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,539
the um in the ring but but other than

2950
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,819
that I think I think Australian stands

2951
01:51:57,539 --> 01:52:01,859
doing really well we're growing there's

2952
01:51:59,819 --> 01:52:03,420
a number of cool breeders popping their

2953
01:52:01,859 --> 01:52:05,698
heads up

2954
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:07,440
um I I wouldn't want to do any Miss

2955
01:52:05,698 --> 01:52:08,819
justice but like some of them that jump

2956
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:10,319
to mind immediately are like you know

2957
01:52:08,819 --> 01:52:12,599
we've already mentioned Wally duck who's

2958
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:15,059
like you know a bit of a an older legend

2959
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:16,860
of the scene but there's some new cool

2960
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:18,539
upcoming guys I'd say check out like my

2961
01:52:16,859 --> 01:52:21,000
buddy Farrell who I mentioned earlier

2962
01:52:18,539 --> 01:52:23,039
who does like that land race Thai versus

2963
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,719
modern stuff like a cool sort of clash

2964
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:26,100
of the worlds

2965
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:29,520
um another guy who sees I've got

2966
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:31,920
recently uh stinky Jones he's done some

2967
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:33,420
cool work another guy bootleg and then

2968
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:35,158
another guy

2969
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:37,679
um finally who I'd give a shout out to

2970
01:52:35,158 --> 01:52:39,899
is local bird seed gotta love that name

2971
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:41,520
I love that name

2972
01:52:39,899 --> 01:52:43,319
but yeah so there are some cool

2973
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:44,820
Australian dudes if you're interested in

2974
01:52:43,319 --> 01:52:46,259
just sort of seeing what's going on in

2975
01:52:44,819 --> 01:52:49,139
Australia I highly recommend you check

2976
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:51,900
some of those guys out oh another guy uh

2977
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:53,219
called uh easty's treats

2978
01:52:51,899 --> 01:52:54,779
um again I don't want to miss anyone out

2979
01:52:53,219 --> 01:52:56,579
I'm sorry if I don't do it yeah it's

2980
01:52:54,779 --> 01:52:58,679
hard because like you don't miss anyone

2981
01:52:56,579 --> 01:53:00,899
and but yeah no I think it's awesome you

2982
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:02,819
get some names out there if you can

2983
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:05,519
but yeah there's cool stuff going down

2984
01:53:02,819 --> 01:53:07,198
in Australia and um I think yeah largely

2985
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,179
speaking you'll see me working the

2986
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:10,979
raspberry and the jelly breath stuff but

2987
01:53:09,179 --> 01:53:13,500
the one cool little thing I can tell you

2988
01:53:10,979 --> 01:53:15,359
guys about is where my buddy Farrell

2989
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:17,579
messaged me and said hey you know I got

2990
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:18,719
this S1 you've got to come see it he

2991
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:20,819
also said

2992
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:23,520
what do you think the chances are that

2993
01:53:20,819 --> 01:53:26,939
you had pollen contamination and I said

2994
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:29,280
I I don't think so the tent was on its

2995
01:53:26,939 --> 01:53:33,000
own you know blah blah and he said I

2996
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:35,158
found a male in the s1s and I was like

2997
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,779
okay I've heard of this but like

2998
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:38,819
probably more likely pollen

2999
01:53:36,779 --> 01:53:40,800
contamination than because I think Sam

3000
01:53:38,819 --> 01:53:43,019
said you get like three and a thousand

3001
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,340
or something like it depends on how the

3002
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,159
genetics line up but yeah it's it's

3003
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,199
usually very small yeah so in the back

3004
01:53:47,158 --> 01:53:51,000
of my mind I'm like it could be that but

3005
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:54,178
it could probably more likely pollen

3006
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:57,000
contamination anyway so I've got this

3007
01:53:54,179 --> 01:53:58,440
male raspberry mama and so we thought

3008
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,738
the first thing to do is try to flower

3009
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:05,099
it like let's just see and um this thing

3010
01:54:01,738 --> 01:54:06,779
like you you can't make it flour unless

3011
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:09,480
you fully put it into flour like I put

3012
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:11,279
it in the tiniest pot I could I made it

3013
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:14,099
root bound I put it under 24 hours of

3014
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:16,500
light I tried my last try to stress

3015
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:18,360
induce flour yeah it would not budge

3016
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,219
it's the only plan I have that like

3017
01:54:18,359 --> 01:54:22,439
basically won't even show you it's a

3018
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:23,760
male in veg yeah yeah that's a good

3019
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:25,439
thing for a male because males usually

3020
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,400
just flour at the first sign of root

3021
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:29,158
restriction

3022
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:33,059
I mean to me

3023
01:54:29,158 --> 01:54:37,198
um you know you guys there are males

3024
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:40,260
that appear in in reversals yeah um the

3025
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:43,738
way to really know is like if you used

3026
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:46,920
any pollen from that mail on anything

3027
01:54:43,738 --> 01:54:48,839
um and you remember up the seeds uh if

3028
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:51,359
it was a regular if it was regular

3029
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:55,619
pollen then you'd get anywhere from 20

3030
01:54:51,359 --> 01:54:57,779
to 80 percent male female ratio and if

3031
01:54:55,618 --> 01:54:59,399
it's you know feminized then you'd only

3032
01:54:57,779 --> 01:55:01,679
get female seeds or it wouldn't even

3033
01:54:59,399 --> 01:55:04,259
take I mean it might not even be volunt

3034
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:06,000
I'm not 100 sure that's really accurate

3035
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:09,539
because we don't understand the whole

3036
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,920
sexual chromosome nature like the uh I

3037
01:55:09,539 --> 01:55:12,960
don't even remember the proper term I'm

3038
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:13,980
gonna make myself sound stupid but we

3039
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,100
don't understand

3040
01:55:13,979 --> 01:55:19,500
um the whole the whole nature of not

3041
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:21,840
just the sex chromosomes but the what is

3042
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:24,000
it autosomes that that aren't related to

3043
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:26,400
sex chromosomes a lot of those are

3044
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,979
something is having an effect on the sex

3045
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:32,279
chromosomes aside from just the natural

3046
01:55:28,979 --> 01:55:33,959
genetics X chromosomes so I'm not sure

3047
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:35,759
if that really plays out that way I

3048
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:38,698
think what we found out most is that

3049
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:41,699
when there are males and feminized stock

3050
01:55:38,698 --> 01:55:44,279
they tend to be males or females only

3051
01:55:41,698 --> 01:55:47,279
expressing male for whatever reason

3052
01:55:44,279 --> 01:55:49,920
but wow yeah I hadn't I hadn't actually

3053
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:52,618
thought about that I thought yeah that's

3054
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:55,319
great so so they should test female when

3055
01:55:52,618 --> 01:55:57,599
you test yeah so what my plan initially

3056
01:55:55,319 --> 01:55:59,880
is I'm thinking well I've done the

3057
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:02,039
reversal with like the The Proven female

3058
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:03,779
that we really like so I was like why

3059
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:06,420
don't I just try to make the regular

3060
01:56:03,779 --> 01:56:09,420
versions of those Femme crosses and and

3061
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:11,819
if this thing is in fact you know a male

3062
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:14,100
or a female show like I should get some

3063
01:56:11,819 --> 01:56:15,420
similarities between those two seeds

3064
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:17,880
right see the parents in there right

3065
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:22,679
yeah or I thought alternatively I could

3066
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:24,300
try to do F2 S2 F2

3067
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:26,579
so that would be yeah that'd be

3068
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:28,800
interesting oh yeah so just crossed that

3069
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:30,539
mail to keep the thing now and just see

3070
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,279
what it so yeah it's going to be

3071
01:56:30,539 --> 01:56:33,479
interesting to dive down this rabbit

3072
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:36,359
hole because it starts to get a bit

3073
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:37,738
confusing with the um the lineage but it

3074
01:56:36,359 --> 01:56:40,139
should be interesting and I'm sort of

3075
01:56:37,738 --> 01:56:41,759
keen to see where it goes you know DJ

3076
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:45,300
shorts the king of playing with weird

3077
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:47,100
lineages like Crossing making F1 like

3078
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:48,659
technically what would be f1s within the

3079
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:50,699
same line each gender successor

3080
01:56:48,658 --> 01:56:52,859
generation without ever like breeding

3081
01:56:50,698 --> 01:56:54,779
for this specific path or that specific

3082
01:56:52,859 --> 01:56:56,460
it's interesting I think it's

3083
01:56:54,779 --> 01:56:58,679
fascinating and it made some of like my

3084
01:56:56,460 --> 01:57:01,260
favorite stuff regardless if it was like

3085
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:05,100
considered uh

3086
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:07,380
technical or correct it ended up making

3087
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:09,420
some really fascinating stuff that I

3088
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:11,159
have no end inside of ever stopping

3089
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:14,099
working with

3090
01:57:11,158 --> 01:57:15,539
yeah yeah DJ's stuff is is killer and

3091
01:57:14,099 --> 01:57:18,420
he's he's definitely done more wild

3092
01:57:15,539 --> 01:57:20,279
stuff than any of us which is cool yeah

3093
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:21,840
um so what like if people wanted to get

3094
01:57:20,279 --> 01:57:23,698
the Australian guy stuff where would

3095
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,739
they go like online where is there a

3096
01:57:23,698 --> 01:57:26,819
place they can get this stuff yeah good

3097
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:29,638
question

3098
01:57:26,819 --> 01:57:32,579
um probably about half of those guys I

3099
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:36,000
mentioned uh I stocked at maybe like

3100
01:57:32,579 --> 01:57:38,279
Little Australian seed banks so that

3101
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,899
might be one Avenue to go down my my

3102
01:57:38,279 --> 01:57:41,939
work is stocked at a seed bank in

3103
01:57:39,899 --> 01:57:43,920
Australia called top shelf seed bank I

3104
01:57:41,939 --> 01:57:45,719
know that feral is also stopped there

3105
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:47,760
and some of those other guys might pop

3106
01:57:45,719 --> 01:57:48,539
up on there but I would always encourage

3107
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,179
you

3108
01:57:48,539 --> 01:57:53,219
um if you were interested drop drop the

3109
01:57:51,179 --> 01:57:54,480
guy directly a message Australia you

3110
01:57:53,219 --> 01:57:56,399
know these these guys aren't big

3111
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:58,259
breeders they're going to be very stoked

3112
01:57:56,399 --> 01:57:59,519
that you're interested in maybe learning

3113
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:01,619
a little bit about what they're doing

3114
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,659
and um I think they would be very

3115
01:58:01,618 --> 01:58:05,519
receptive to anyone who dropped him a

3116
01:58:03,658 --> 01:58:08,279
line and said hey I'm in the states and

3117
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:10,080
uh maybe I could try some of your seeds

3118
01:58:08,279 --> 01:58:12,118
um yeah I think they would be receptive

3119
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:13,738
to that so by all means listen to the

3120
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:15,238
names I mentioned

3121
01:58:13,738 --> 01:58:17,819
um and and just type them into Instagram

3122
01:58:15,238 --> 01:58:19,379
or or just like go to my

3123
01:58:17,819 --> 01:58:21,899
um Instagram and look at who I follow

3124
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:23,699
and they'll they'll be in there and um

3125
01:58:21,899 --> 01:58:26,219
yeah drop them a line for sure because

3126
01:58:23,698 --> 01:58:28,198
as I mentioned earlier if nothing else

3127
01:58:26,219 --> 01:58:30,300
you probably have a little bit of a

3128
01:58:28,198 --> 01:58:31,919
better chance of finding something that

3129
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:34,560
just feels a little bit different

3130
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:36,420
because we just don't have access to all

3131
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:40,080
of those clones and so things inherently

3132
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:42,719
have to be a little different and um

3133
01:58:40,079 --> 01:58:45,479
I love it I love I loved it that you

3134
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:47,279
that like I've I've pretty much thought

3135
01:58:45,479 --> 01:58:49,138
about just dropping every single clone

3136
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:50,579
from here on out and only working with

3137
01:58:49,139 --> 01:58:51,599
what I've made out of seed from here on

3138
01:58:50,579 --> 01:58:53,399
out

3139
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:55,440
um I've lost a lot of that love for

3140
01:58:53,399 --> 01:58:57,118
finding other people's Keepers or

3141
01:58:55,439 --> 01:58:59,279
messing with other things people other

3142
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:01,380
people call Keepers and really really

3143
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:03,420
just looking at what's out there in seed

3144
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:05,340
and just trying to enjoy that some more

3145
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:06,658
because as Americans we it's really easy

3146
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:08,279
to get trapped in the Clone on the game

3147
01:59:06,658 --> 01:59:10,559
and constantly chasing that next clone

3148
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:12,300
only and that and when you don't have

3149
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,920
when you when you have a constant access

3150
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:17,099
to stuff like that

3151
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,779
it it's it's easy to fall into it

3152
01:59:17,099 --> 01:59:20,579
permanently and I've kind of tried to

3153
01:59:18,779 --> 01:59:22,439
push myself out of that when I when I

3154
01:59:20,579 --> 01:59:24,719
lost my whole collection

3155
01:59:22,439 --> 01:59:27,299
um I I was bummed man that was that was

3156
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:28,800
a long time of collecting and it and it

3157
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:30,539
pushed me into uncomfortable zone of

3158
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:32,279
having to pop seeds and it made me find

3159
01:59:30,539 --> 01:59:34,139
that love and all that again so I kind

3160
01:59:32,279 --> 01:59:36,359
of Envy a little bit some of that out

3161
01:59:34,139 --> 01:59:38,579
there in Australia that that they they

3162
01:59:36,359 --> 01:59:41,399
still have that love for C at night I'm

3163
01:59:38,579 --> 01:59:44,880
glad I get to find that again you know

3164
01:59:41,399 --> 01:59:46,259
I think it goes in phases you know uh to

3165
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:48,118
what heavy days was talking about

3166
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:50,039
earlier when people were like breeding

3167
01:59:48,118 --> 01:59:51,899
for what they like

3168
01:59:50,039 --> 01:59:54,000
um I think it's we've had a massive

3169
01:59:51,899 --> 01:59:56,638
explosion of American breeding going on

3170
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,819
but a lot of it has been profit-based

3171
01:59:56,639 --> 02:00:04,079
and so it's been crossing a lot of the

3172
01:59:59,819 --> 02:00:07,500
same 30 to 60 Cuts in innumerable ways

3173
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:08,939
right and you know if you don't care to

3174
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:10,260
sell seed and you're just doing it for

3175
02:00:08,939 --> 02:00:12,059
yourself and your friends you can

3176
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:14,400
literally pick any weird thing you want

3177
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:17,580
and go in any direction you want you're

3178
02:00:14,399 --> 02:00:19,500
not limited by anything in that regard a

3179
02:00:17,579 --> 02:00:22,920
lot of times people are like I want this

3180
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:24,840
drop to sell well therefore I'm going to

3181
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:27,060
use things that have name recognition

3182
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:29,819
and I'm going to walk down this path

3183
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:31,980
that's been walked before you know yeah

3184
02:00:29,819 --> 02:00:33,479
um but if you don't care about that then

3185
02:00:31,979 --> 02:00:34,738
the world is your oyster and there's a

3186
02:00:33,479 --> 02:00:37,439
lot of weird [Â __Â ] out there that you

3187
02:00:34,738 --> 02:00:39,539
there's a lot of directions you can go

3188
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:42,299
um if you know and sometimes you know

3189
02:00:39,539 --> 02:00:45,000
maybe you change the game who knows you

3190
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:46,679
know uh it it it uh you know things

3191
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,658
aren't new and you know it's like it's

3192
02:00:46,679 --> 02:00:51,859
just like new genres of music right it's

3193
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:53,638
not Popular until it is

3194
02:00:51,859 --> 02:00:56,158
right

3195
02:00:53,639 --> 02:00:57,659
yeah hugely and and I can hugely relate

3196
02:00:56,158 --> 02:01:01,259
to everything you just said because if

3197
02:00:57,658 --> 02:01:03,299
if someone said to me like right now

3198
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:05,039
do you think you could base a whole

3199
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:07,440
breeding program off something you found

3200
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:09,658
in a pack of Kenneth seeds I'd say [Â __Â ]

3201
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:11,219
no yeah you know what I mean so it was

3202
02:01:09,658 --> 02:01:12,839
the fact that I wasn't thinking about

3203
02:01:11,219 --> 02:01:14,219
that which allowed me to try something

3204
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:16,139
that I just thought is a bit weird and

3205
02:01:14,219 --> 02:01:17,698
different and then all of a sudden you

3206
02:01:16,139 --> 02:01:19,500
find something really cool in there and

3207
02:01:17,698 --> 02:01:22,079
I I try to encourage people to do that

3208
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:23,760
I'm like grow what interests you because

3209
02:01:22,079 --> 02:01:25,859
you never know what'll jump out and it

3210
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:27,800
could be as you just alluded to the

3211
02:01:25,859 --> 02:01:30,118
start of something which goes on to be

3212
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:32,820
changes the whole scene

3213
02:01:30,118 --> 02:01:34,198
I mean in the worst case scenario if you

3214
02:01:32,819 --> 02:01:35,819
do a bunch of breeding and doesn't make

3215
02:01:34,198 --> 02:01:38,158
any money and a lot of people don't like

3216
02:01:35,819 --> 02:01:40,500
it as long as you can fall back on I

3217
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:42,719
like it yeah right

3218
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:44,899
you know I like it I like all this

3219
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:47,880
matters

3220
02:01:44,899 --> 02:01:49,439
right it's so valuable to just have said

3221
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:51,599
you know I went through the process of

3222
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:54,539
selecting it making the seeds testing

3223
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:56,400
them and then having the foresight to

3224
02:01:54,539 --> 02:01:58,380
say you know what maybe this is a dead

3225
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:00,238
end but at least I got experience out of

3226
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:02,400
it you know what I mean it's interesting

3227
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:05,279
and being able to say the things that

3228
02:02:02,399 --> 02:02:06,960
did end is a valuable tool too that is a

3229
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:08,399
valuable tool I mean everybody should do

3230
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:11,099
everybody should realize that most

3231
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:12,359
breeding is failure yeah but I don't

3232
02:02:11,099 --> 02:02:13,619
think that's a comment I don't think

3233
02:02:12,359 --> 02:02:14,519
that's common sense to most people

3234
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:15,899
though

3235
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:18,020
um at least into seed making because

3236
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:22,019
seed making failure isn't making money

3237
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:24,060
and most of it's about making money so

3238
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:25,800
if they're seeds you can sell them as

3239
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:27,860
long as you can Market them so it's not

3240
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:30,119
I mean never any sense as you think

3241
02:02:27,859 --> 02:02:31,679
Neville used to have this joke right

3242
02:02:30,118 --> 02:02:35,519
that everything he did with the haze

3243
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:37,079
passed F1 he made it worse yeah yeah you

3244
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:39,780
know he was never able to make it better

3245
02:02:37,079 --> 02:02:41,819
like the nl5 hazes and the first crosses

3246
02:02:39,779 --> 02:02:43,380
that they made and did those were all

3247
02:02:41,819 --> 02:02:45,658
better than all the later stuff in his

3248
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:48,060
opinion even though he tried really hard

3249
02:02:45,658 --> 02:02:50,219
you know so sometimes and there's luck

3250
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:51,960
in it you know you could find you could

3251
02:02:50,219 --> 02:02:53,760
not find it in a ton of seeds or you

3252
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:56,840
could find it in the first 10 or 15 you

3253
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,840
pop yeah

3254
02:02:58,039 --> 02:03:03,238
hugely hugely and it's um it's

3255
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:06,480
interesting you say that because I I try

3256
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:08,939
to encourage people to also not

3257
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:11,638
um buy into any paradigms about having

3258
02:03:08,939 --> 02:03:13,319
to pop any certain number of seeds like

3259
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:16,020
of course the more you pop the more you

3260
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:17,519
likely but I talk to people who

3261
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:19,260
don't pop seeds because they're like

3262
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:21,540
well I can't pop 40. so what's the point

3263
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:24,300
exactly yeah and I'd just say most of my

3264
02:03:21,539 --> 02:03:25,800
favorite like my the jelly breath I I

3265
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:28,320
reference right I try to I try to make

3266
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:30,119
this clear that jelly breath I I you

3267
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:31,738
know you could say it's biased but I

3268
02:03:30,118 --> 02:03:34,920
genuinely believe it's the best cutting

3269
02:03:31,738 --> 02:03:37,979
in Australia and I will be fully upfront

3270
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:41,579
in saying that I got those as three

3271
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:43,979
feminized freebie seeds that's cool you

3272
02:03:41,579 --> 02:03:45,840
know what I mean it's like the the best

3273
02:03:43,979 --> 02:03:47,879
[Â __Â ] can come from who knows where and

3274
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:49,260
it could be one or two yeah the Mendo

3275
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:50,099
perps right that was like two seeds

3276
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:53,760
right

3277
02:03:50,099 --> 02:03:55,560
two yeah yeah literally two and uh one

3278
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:57,300
of them was a male so it's the lowest

3279
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:00,060
possible Fino hunt you could ever have

3280
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:02,340
you know when is that girl one of the

3281
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:03,960
best blueberries I had found in all of

3282
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:05,880
the years of searching for blueberry was

3283
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:08,639
a freaking freebie from dynafin

3284
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:10,319
blueberry hash plant like of all the odd

3285
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:11,579
things out there that you think you you

3286
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:13,679
know it had some of the best blueberry

3287
02:04:11,579 --> 02:04:15,960
smells up until you know the Bonnet

3288
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:18,239
during that run so yeah it could come

3289
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:19,679
from anywhere it's so crazy you just

3290
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:21,539
mentioned that because one of the

3291
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:25,079
earliest strains I grew that was

3292
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:27,300
impressive was a dynafem strain we call

3293
02:04:25,079 --> 02:04:28,979
it was called Blue strawberry I think

3294
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:31,079
whatever the blue component like maybe

3295
02:04:28,979 --> 02:04:32,698
the blueberry was the pollen donor part

3296
02:04:31,079 --> 02:04:34,319
in this one as well because I

3297
02:04:32,698 --> 02:04:36,118
specifically remembered oh blue

3298
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:38,158
strawberries world of seeds

3299
02:04:36,118 --> 02:04:40,319
uh it mustn't have been blue strawberry

3300
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:42,299
then it was definitely dynafin but maybe

3301
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:45,118
they did maybe they made a couple of

3302
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:47,159
hybrids with them pollen but yeah but I

3303
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:49,198
also remembered like looking back I'm

3304
02:04:47,158 --> 02:04:51,420
like man how did dinosaur produce that

3305
02:04:49,198 --> 02:04:53,039
like it was pretty good so the Spanish

3306
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:55,020
breeders what I've learned like knowing

3307
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:57,539
some of them they're [Â __Â ] good like

3308
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:59,820
that like my buddy um

3309
02:04:57,539 --> 02:05:01,139
Ernesto from from Buddha seeds he was

3310
02:04:59,819 --> 02:05:03,000
one of the first doing making a lot of

3311
02:05:01,139 --> 02:05:05,159
seeds for a greenhouse and Nirvana doing

3312
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,899
the big massive productions for these

3313
02:05:05,158 --> 02:05:08,579
major Dutch companies but in the

3314
02:05:06,899 --> 02:05:10,920
meantime he was also doing Auto flower

3315
02:05:08,579 --> 02:05:13,800
breeding and moving Pakistani to trolley

3316
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:16,020
into an Autoflower Forum into like a

3317
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:18,000
reliably true breeding autoflowering

3318
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:19,500
magenta plant and he did it and I got to

3319
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,960
watch him you know go through this

3320
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:25,139
process and they have some serious good

3321
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:27,840
breeders over there and and I think it's

3322
02:05:25,139 --> 02:05:30,480
very easy to dismiss it because what

3323
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:33,060
they sell isn't necessarily what ends up

3324
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:34,379
in the packages of greenhouse meaning if

3325
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:35,760
they're selling in Neville's Haze to

3326
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:37,380
Greenhouse it doesn't mean Greenhouse is

3327
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:38,340
going to stop get his Neville's Haze it

3328
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:39,239
just means that they bought it and

3329
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:41,219
they're going to put it in one of the

3330
02:05:39,238 --> 02:05:43,979
most likely one of those sativa packages

3331
02:05:41,219 --> 02:05:46,618
that best that best fits it you know

3332
02:05:43,979 --> 02:05:48,118
that's how it goes so when people know

3333
02:05:46,618 --> 02:05:49,618
that they make this stuff they might not

3334
02:05:48,118 --> 02:05:51,118
understand that it's being

3335
02:05:49,618 --> 02:05:53,339
misrepresented what's being made but

3336
02:05:51,118 --> 02:05:55,319
they have some fascinating or fantastic

3337
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:58,199
breeders out there fantastic breeders in

3338
02:05:55,319 --> 02:06:01,439
the Spanish that are heavily under for

3339
02:05:58,198 --> 02:06:04,259
what they for sure

3340
02:06:01,439 --> 02:06:07,079
yeah man I I it's interesting how like

3341
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:09,480
the real heads in the Spanish scene are

3342
02:06:07,079 --> 02:06:11,939
not particularly well known in the USA

3343
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:14,759
scene and I think like not at all yeah

3344
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:18,719
and and some of the Clones like um

3345
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:21,840
what's that that one um the queen mother

3346
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:23,760
oh yeah yeah Reina Madre yeah yeah yeah

3347
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,860
like like there's a whole bunch of

3348
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:28,320
clones that are just absolutely prolific

3349
02:06:25,859 --> 02:06:29,880
over there and people who are like in

3350
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:31,618
both USA they're like oh yeah that's a

3351
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:32,819
good clone it's it's not just like the

3352
02:06:31,618 --> 02:06:35,039
Spanish think it's good but it's not

3353
02:06:32,819 --> 02:06:36,779
yeah and and I think there's another one

3354
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:38,399
called Lily

3355
02:06:36,779 --> 02:06:40,079
I'm not familiar with that one but yeah

3356
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:42,899
okay yeah I think it's from that same

3357
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:45,420
crew it uses that zamo slash Queen

3358
02:06:42,899 --> 02:06:47,339
Mother stuff anyway yeah um yeah really

3359
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:48,840
interesting stuff for sure it'd be Keen

3360
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:51,539
to get in there and the more I hear

3361
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:54,719
about La Mano Negros work the more I'm

3362
02:06:51,539 --> 02:06:57,679
like damn I wish we had more clear info

3363
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:57,679
about his life

3364
02:07:01,099 --> 02:07:04,860
he was an excellent breeder but he did

3365
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:06,900
inject a lot of Dutch [Â __Â ] into his

3366
02:07:04,859 --> 02:07:08,460
stuff and left that out and that's why

3367
02:07:06,899 --> 02:07:10,618
it's so pretty because it is very

3368
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:12,719
dutified and he did not keep that very

3369
02:07:10,618 --> 02:07:15,000
clear he was a good Storyteller and he

3370
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:17,158
made some amazing stuff but for a

3371
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,300
preservationist you wouldn't I think a

3372
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:20,339
lot of the people that were around him

3373
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:21,779
that liked him a lot were were more

3374
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:23,880
saddened to find out that it was very

3375
02:07:21,779 --> 02:07:25,139
injected with Dutch stuff and left out

3376
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:26,579
for someone who was such a serious

3377
02:07:25,139 --> 02:07:30,118
preservationist but he did make some

3378
02:07:26,579 --> 02:07:32,219
amazing stuff for sure I mean it it goes

3379
02:07:30,118 --> 02:07:34,920
to to your previous point in which you

3380
02:07:32,219 --> 02:07:36,539
were sort of happy that uh clones from

3381
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:38,340
America weren't making their way to

3382
02:07:36,539 --> 02:07:40,979
Australia because you were avoiding the

3383
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:43,560
whole viroid and you know super mites

3384
02:07:40,979 --> 02:07:46,439
and all the various uh things that we

3385
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:49,080
struggle with but to the Spain Point

3386
02:07:46,439 --> 02:07:52,738
um you know International borders and

3387
02:07:49,079 --> 02:07:55,920
customs and oceans are a real barrier uh

3388
02:07:52,738 --> 02:07:58,439
no they're not genetics Spain is murder

3389
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:00,599
like Spain Amsterdam all of them have

3390
02:07:58,439 --> 02:08:02,098
been murdered by the hlb now all of them

3391
02:08:00,599 --> 02:08:05,159
they've been taken out

3392
02:08:02,099 --> 02:08:06,599
so right well not any there's no good

3393
02:08:05,158 --> 02:08:07,979
barrier there that's all I've been

3394
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:10,139
hearing about lately is the Spanish but

3395
02:08:07,979 --> 02:08:12,539
I just mentioned in a sense I I actually

3396
02:08:10,139 --> 02:08:14,760
meant more in the sense of like you know

3397
02:08:12,539 --> 02:08:16,139
in America like we don't get very we

3398
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:17,940
don't it's not like you get Spanish

3399
02:08:16,139 --> 02:08:19,739
strength oh no no you're right it's not

3400
02:08:17,939 --> 02:08:21,299
like you're getting you know like like

3401
02:08:19,738 --> 02:08:23,579
things that he was just talking about

3402
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:26,639
that might be very famous in Spain and

3403
02:08:23,579 --> 02:08:28,979
amazing Cuts you know um it took you

3404
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:31,199
know there's a couple of the Neville's

3405
02:08:28,979 --> 02:08:33,238
uh not Neville's Hayes but like a couple

3406
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:36,658
of Neville's f1s that have made their

3407
02:08:33,238 --> 02:08:37,738
way to America now but it took like 30

3408
02:08:36,658 --> 02:08:40,500
years

3409
02:08:37,738 --> 02:08:43,319
and most of them aren't over here you

3410
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:46,139
know and so Australia Spain Europe

3411
02:08:43,319 --> 02:08:48,599
America even Canada which like America

3412
02:08:46,139 --> 02:08:51,060
and Canada share a border there's

3413
02:08:48,599 --> 02:08:53,940
there's that border and you know is a

3414
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:55,860
real barrier to free exchange of

3415
02:08:53,939 --> 02:08:57,960
genetics and there's really good things

3416
02:08:55,859 --> 02:09:01,259
in Canada that don't really exist in

3417
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:03,480
America and vice versa because of that

3418
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:05,219
barrier I'm not so sure they don't make

3419
02:09:03,479 --> 02:09:06,539
it over here I'm not so sure that it's

3420
02:09:05,219 --> 02:09:09,060
that they don't pick up because they're

3421
02:09:06,539 --> 02:09:10,319
not popular strains because we've had a

3422
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:12,060
lot of the the Dutch stuff even the

3423
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:13,559
quays was over here I had it but I was

3424
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:15,900
too stupid to keep it you know like

3425
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:17,580
stuff makes it over but because it's not

3426
02:09:15,899 --> 02:09:19,259
popular it doesn't necessarily spread to

3427
02:09:17,579 --> 02:09:21,000
a lot of those Spanish strains have

3428
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:22,079
weird name like the critical Bilbo like

3429
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,760
over here that would sound like critical

3430
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:27,238
dildo like No One's Gonna grow critical

3431
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:29,400
dildo over here right so I mean some of

3432
02:09:27,238 --> 02:09:30,178
it is an Aiming convention for sure

3433
02:09:29,399 --> 02:09:32,279
um

3434
02:09:30,179 --> 02:09:33,899
but yeah it is it is kind of crazy that

3435
02:09:32,279 --> 02:09:35,340
there isn't more exchange between the

3436
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:36,779
countries even with tissue culture being

3437
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:38,760
more prevalent and stuff that we're not

3438
02:09:36,779 --> 02:09:40,198
seeing more of an exchange I don't know

3439
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:43,039
I don't know what that is other than

3440
02:09:40,198 --> 02:09:43,039
naming conventions

3441
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:48,300
and you know what that Segways nicely

3442
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:51,118
into like something I wanted to ask you

3443
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:52,800
guys which is that there's I mean not

3444
02:09:51,118 --> 02:09:55,259
not just now but in recent years there's

3445
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:57,360
been quite a focal discussion around

3446
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:58,860
um the nomenclature or cannabis and like

3447
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:00,899
how we really need to get with the times

3448
02:09:58,859 --> 02:10:02,759
but there's a part of me that thinks

3449
02:10:00,899 --> 02:10:05,460
that may never actually change because

3450
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:07,679
it's just so widely disseminated the

3451
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:08,698
current language I'd love to hear you

3452
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:10,260
guys thoughts like do you think we'll

3453
02:10:08,698 --> 02:10:12,419
ever have a global reset or do you think

3454
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:13,800
it'll just continue on and the squeaky

3455
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:16,340
wheel will keep letting us know we're

3456
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:20,340
doing it wrong and that sort of vibe

3457
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:22,679
I it could change over time I mean I do

3458
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:25,739
think that you know like for instance

3459
02:10:22,679 --> 02:10:28,139
like how in cannabis we use BX

3460
02:10:25,738 --> 02:10:32,399
uh and it's not ever used outside of

3461
02:10:28,139 --> 02:10:34,199
cannabis it's always BC back cross right

3462
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:36,059
um but I don't know even though it might

3463
02:10:34,198 --> 02:10:37,500
like scientists and stuff might look at

3464
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:40,020
it and laugh at us

3465
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:42,679
we're still conv we're still using that

3466
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:45,420
word BX to convey the right information

3467
02:10:42,679 --> 02:10:48,960
like people understand what the word

3468
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:51,899
means you know and so some of that is

3469
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:54,480
you know I mean I guess like you know uh

3470
02:10:51,899 --> 02:10:58,500
you know they they misnamed and you know

3471
02:10:54,479 --> 02:11:00,718
Indica should be afghanika and uh and

3472
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:03,479
you know sativa should be Indica because

3473
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:05,399
it comes from India and sativa should

3474
02:11:03,479 --> 02:11:07,138
really be rude you know ruderalis should

3475
02:11:05,399 --> 02:11:10,259
really you know all that I don't think

3476
02:11:07,139 --> 02:11:13,440
that'll ever catch on no I think it's I

3477
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:16,739
think sativa Indica is too ingrained in

3478
02:11:13,439 --> 02:11:18,658
in the in in our subculture

3479
02:11:16,738 --> 02:11:21,118
um and I don't think it'll I don't think

3480
02:11:18,658 --> 02:11:23,339
that'll shift even people that are anal

3481
02:11:21,118 --> 02:11:25,439
about it like me still use Indica sativa

3482
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:26,760
so I I think you know and then there's

3483
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:29,460
also this thing where you look at some

3484
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:32,400
you look at some stupid seat seed bank

3485
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:36,539
or whatever and it's like oh this is 72

3486
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:38,939
indica and 18 sativa and you're like all

3487
02:11:36,539 --> 02:11:41,760
that's made up yeah I have no idea you

3488
02:11:38,939 --> 02:11:43,919
know like whatsoever so like it it is it

3489
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:46,139
is misleading in a sense because I I

3490
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:48,118
definitely think percentages they mostly

3491
02:11:46,139 --> 02:11:51,480
just pull out of their ass

3492
02:11:48,118 --> 02:11:52,738
for sure yeah hugely hugely and I

3493
02:11:51,479 --> 02:11:54,899
definitely have noticed a lot of

3494
02:11:52,738 --> 02:11:58,198
breeders these days just list everything

3495
02:11:54,899 --> 02:12:01,259
as 60 40 Indica dominant that's a way

3496
02:11:58,198 --> 02:12:03,178
man and you know the confusion the

3497
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:05,280
confusion around phenotype versus

3498
02:12:03,179 --> 02:12:07,260
genotype

3499
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:09,840
um you know some of that kind of kind of

3500
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:11,760
stuff is you know that probably should

3501
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,219
change over time

3502
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:16,139
um you know I think uh be pretty well

3503
02:12:14,219 --> 02:12:18,300
established it we got it right

3504
02:12:16,139 --> 02:12:19,679
um on the last episode I did with uh the

3505
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:22,320
PHD lady I was like hey you know what

3506
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:23,520
like I want to know am I am I using this

3507
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:25,198
word correctly because I'm not a

3508
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:26,699
scientist I'm not a botanist by trade

3509
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:29,759
you know like phenotype like as I

3510
02:12:26,698 --> 02:12:32,519
learned it genotype are the genes behind

3511
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:34,920
the expressible traits right what you're

3512
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:36,900
visually seeing are the phenotype the

3513
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:38,639
visual traits that are expressed this is

3514
02:12:36,899 --> 02:12:40,920
the phenotype the genotype are the genes

3515
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:42,779
behind it you're not you know so I think

3516
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:45,118
we're using it correctly according to

3517
02:12:42,779 --> 02:12:48,658
her anyways I hope so folks I hate being

3518
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:51,598
wrong but yeah I mean I guess my general

3519
02:12:48,658 --> 02:12:53,279
point is that like we uh but you know

3520
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:55,440
that that's what cannabis does right

3521
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:57,599
like we take we take these like real

3522
02:12:55,439 --> 02:13:00,059
world terms and then we like

3523
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:02,639
create our own use with them and it's

3524
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:04,440
like what made you know legalization so

3525
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:06,599
hard in some ways is like in Colorado

3526
02:13:04,439 --> 02:13:08,460
when it first went legal they went in

3527
02:13:06,599 --> 02:13:10,679
and took all these suggestive children

3528
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:14,158
names and candy names and trademark

3529
02:13:10,679 --> 02:13:16,560
names off the cookies as cookies because

3530
02:13:14,158 --> 02:13:18,539
the Girl Scouts sued them yeah yeah

3531
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:20,579
right

3532
02:13:18,539 --> 02:13:23,158
um you know and and so we had all this

3533
02:13:20,578 --> 02:13:25,679
Counter Culture tongue-in-cheek funny

3534
02:13:23,158 --> 02:13:28,319
names that played off things that people

3535
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:29,880
knew I don't see any reason why that's

3536
02:13:28,319 --> 02:13:32,219
not going to continue to some degree in

3537
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:34,020
science I mean we're a pretty subversive

3538
02:13:32,219 --> 02:13:35,578
group

3539
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:39,260
um and our opinion is you should bend

3540
02:13:35,578 --> 02:13:39,259
towards us yeah yeah

3541
02:13:43,219 --> 02:13:47,099
I think it like I I totally agree with

3542
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:49,199
what you're saying and I think it speaks

3543
02:13:47,099 --> 02:13:51,380
to the point of that

3544
02:13:49,198 --> 02:13:53,399
um the purpose of language is not

3545
02:13:51,380 --> 02:13:56,340
necessarily to be a hundred percent

3546
02:13:53,399 --> 02:13:58,138
technically correct but to facilitate an

3547
02:13:56,340 --> 02:14:00,719
exchange of ideas where we both know

3548
02:13:58,139 --> 02:14:01,920
we're talking about the same thing and

3549
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:04,380
that's what you're alluding to it's like

3550
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:06,179
we say sativa because we both know that

3551
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:08,880
we are thinking of the same thing when

3552
02:14:06,179 --> 02:14:11,578
we say sativa and I think that's almost

3553
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:13,319
in a sense the manifestation of language

3554
02:14:11,578 --> 02:14:15,299
evolving in front of your eyes it's like

3555
02:14:13,319 --> 02:14:16,679
maybe it's not technically correct but

3556
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:18,420
we know what we're saying to each other

3557
02:14:16,679 --> 02:14:21,658
and that's almost more important to

3558
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:23,520
facilitate ideas being exchanged but you

3559
02:14:21,658 --> 02:14:25,500
know I almost wondered with the the

3560
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:27,659
continuation of the sativa Indica thing

3561
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:29,340
though if it really takes away from the

3562
02:14:27,658 --> 02:14:30,839
effect of the high because I think

3563
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:32,880
that's where it genuinely confuses

3564
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:35,400
people when they go into collectives and

3565
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:37,800
they say I would like a sativa because I

3566
02:14:35,399 --> 02:14:39,539
know because this the I'm Jim Belushi

3567
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:40,860
show it told me that sativas give me

3568
02:14:39,539 --> 02:14:42,960
energy and I need to go work in the

3569
02:14:40,859 --> 02:14:45,118
garden and that's where you run into to

3570
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:46,739
the problems because just because maybe

3571
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:47,698
it is a narrow leaf type plant doesn't

3572
02:14:46,738 --> 02:14:50,039
necessarily mean it's going to have a

3573
02:14:47,698 --> 02:14:51,719
specific type high so maybe maybe that's

3574
02:14:50,039 --> 02:14:54,238
where the education needs to be not in a

3575
02:14:51,719 --> 02:14:57,719
new whole new terminology but in in

3576
02:14:54,238 --> 02:14:59,279
explaining High types and that's because

3577
02:14:57,719 --> 02:15:00,779
sativa Indica traits don't necessarily

3578
02:14:59,279 --> 02:15:03,300
mean high-type

3579
02:15:00,779 --> 02:15:05,460
I don't necessarily know if that is

3580
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:07,940
gonna be it because I think now that

3581
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:10,859
consumerism and legality is involved

3582
02:15:07,939 --> 02:15:13,799
what you see like in in food and stuff

3583
02:15:10,859 --> 02:15:15,000
like that is people will use like the

3584
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,980
word natural

3585
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,399
like if things don't have a specific

3586
02:15:16,979 --> 02:15:23,279
legal meaning but they convey an idea or

3587
02:15:20,399 --> 02:15:25,799
an image then marketers are going to use

3588
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:28,738
them to their advantage sure yeah right

3589
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:31,560
so you can't say for instance in America

3590
02:15:28,738 --> 02:15:33,359
this is a hundred percent organic unless

3591
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:35,219
it's actually 100 organic because

3592
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:38,219
there's like a federal Rule and you have

3593
02:15:35,219 --> 02:15:40,679
to but you can say it's all natural yeah

3594
02:15:38,219 --> 02:15:41,939
right and so I think that's the naming

3595
02:15:40,679 --> 02:15:44,399
thing that's going to go on unless

3596
02:15:41,939 --> 02:15:46,198
there's some rule against it people are

3597
02:15:44,399 --> 02:15:48,920
going to call [Â __Â ] whatever they think

3598
02:15:46,198 --> 02:15:48,919
makes them money

3599
02:15:51,618 --> 02:15:56,219
it's why I like to to some degree it's

3600
02:15:54,479 --> 02:15:59,638
why almost all these strains are candy

3601
02:15:56,219 --> 02:16:04,158
and dessert names now yeah right nobody

3602
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:07,020
would name a strain in 2022 the dog [Â __Â ]

3603
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:09,439
they would very unlikely name it you

3604
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:12,300
know Candy Apple something right yeah or

3605
02:16:09,439 --> 02:16:13,859
strawberry or strawberry switch you know

3606
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:16,619
whatever yeah they would they would

3607
02:16:13,859 --> 02:16:18,839
evoke some image it wouldn't be cat piss

3608
02:16:16,618 --> 02:16:21,299
it wouldn't be dog [Â __Â ] it wouldn't be

3609
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:23,940
it you know so

3610
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:25,860
um you know it uh indicate sativa that's

3611
02:16:23,939 --> 02:16:27,779
as long as these as long as these

3612
02:16:25,859 --> 02:16:29,158
perceptions persist about what the

3613
02:16:27,779 --> 02:16:31,380
effect is going to be

3614
02:16:29,158 --> 02:16:33,779
some of these companies they would name

3615
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:34,978
you know they would names weed strains

3616
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:39,239
emotion

3617
02:16:34,978 --> 02:16:41,159
yeah you know like relaxation calm you

3618
02:16:39,239 --> 02:16:43,859
know I think you just gave everyone more

3619
02:16:41,159 --> 02:16:45,539
ideas God damn it but you know that's

3620
02:16:43,859 --> 02:16:47,219
that's what happens right like that's

3621
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:48,780
what it's there's there's a capitalism

3622
02:16:47,218 --> 02:16:50,879
part of it

3623
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:53,519
um and we us weed nerds can argue about

3624
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:54,959
it sure you know and then Berner is

3625
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:57,500
going to be out there being like you

3626
02:16:54,959 --> 02:17:01,018
don't want to smoke some relaxation

3627
02:16:57,500 --> 02:17:02,638
yeah all right because you know it's

3628
02:17:01,019 --> 02:17:04,260
what sells

3629
02:17:02,638 --> 02:17:07,259
that is

3630
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:09,179
that's interesting can I actually make a

3631
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:10,439
really random comment I think you guys

3632
02:17:09,179 --> 02:17:12,780
will be interested in talking about it

3633
02:17:10,439 --> 02:17:14,639
but I wanted to push myself to express

3634
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:16,859
at least one personal opinion that I've

3635
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:18,779
never expressed before because I was

3636
02:17:16,859 --> 02:17:20,399
thinking about a whole diplomatic thing

3637
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:21,540
before the show and I was like yeah I

3638
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:22,519
shouldn't be Diplomat I should say

3639
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:25,500
something

3640
02:17:22,519 --> 02:17:26,880
anyway it ties into what you were just

3641
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:28,439
saying like about like what we can say

3642
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:31,799
and what we can't say and sort of

3643
02:17:28,439 --> 02:17:34,739
Industry versus standard but basically

3644
02:17:31,799 --> 02:17:36,000
in Australia like I I work in um like

3645
02:17:34,739 --> 02:17:37,500
generally speaking the healthcare

3646
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,420
profession and I used to work in

3647
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:41,040
Pharmacy and I experienced it there and

3648
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:43,260
I experienced it now where I currently

3649
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:46,439
work and what I would really love to do

3650
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:49,859
is encourage people to be what I would

3651
02:17:46,439 --> 02:17:52,859
call academically honest about cannabis

3652
02:17:49,859 --> 02:17:54,599
and its effect on people because I speak

3653
02:17:52,859 --> 02:17:57,059
to a lot of people in the healthcare

3654
02:17:54,599 --> 02:17:58,920
industry who are not particularly

3655
02:17:57,058 --> 02:18:01,558
interested in hearing about the benefits

3656
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:04,859
of cannabis because for a long time

3657
02:18:01,558 --> 02:18:07,500
they've heard people quote incorrect

3658
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:09,359
things like Mantra and like the real

3659
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:11,519
specific one that I sort of have a bit

3660
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:14,519
of a pet peeve with is that cannabis

3661
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:16,019
doesn't kill people yeah yeah the thing

3662
02:18:14,519 --> 02:18:18,719
that I would say is

3663
02:18:16,019 --> 02:18:21,540
first of all I I have a family member

3664
02:18:18,718 --> 02:18:23,879
who has um bipolar and when he has

3665
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:26,820
cannabis he goes Manic and becomes very

3666
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:28,319
unwell sure and so I think we need to be

3667
02:18:26,819 --> 02:18:30,599
honest with ourselves and acknowledge

3668
02:18:28,319 --> 02:18:34,978
that cannabis actually maybe isn't for

3669
02:18:30,599 --> 02:18:37,739
everyone and that's okay because I think

3670
02:18:34,978 --> 02:18:39,239
that the people I speak to they take his

3671
02:18:37,739 --> 02:18:40,859
shoe that they're told you know it's

3672
02:18:39,239 --> 02:18:43,079
it's better than anything it doesn't

3673
02:18:40,859 --> 02:18:45,479
kill anyone blah blah blah and I think

3674
02:18:43,079 --> 02:18:47,819
there's stronger arguments we could use

3675
02:18:45,478 --> 02:18:51,058
it's it's not dishonest to say cannabis

3676
02:18:47,819 --> 02:18:53,579
causes less damage both health-wise and

3677
02:18:51,058 --> 02:18:55,259
societally than any other drug that's a

3678
02:18:53,579 --> 02:18:58,620
very strong argument and it's a hundred

3679
02:18:55,260 --> 02:19:01,319
percent correct however my my buddy is a

3680
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:04,079
doctor and he has literally seen people

3681
02:19:01,319 --> 02:19:05,398
die from getting high and walking in

3682
02:19:04,079 --> 02:19:08,099
front of a car accidentally and getting

3683
02:19:05,398 --> 02:19:10,079
hit by sure he's seen people who present

3684
02:19:08,099 --> 02:19:13,260
who have only smoked green their whole

3685
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:15,299
life and they have emphysema sure and so

3686
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:18,300
you have to be honest with yourselves

3687
02:19:15,299 --> 02:19:20,039
that like there are trade-offs I still

3688
02:19:18,299 --> 02:19:22,018
think it's the best choice by far don't

3689
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:24,179
get me wrong I'm I'm sitting here heavy

3690
02:19:22,019 --> 02:19:25,800
smoker myself but I just think that we

3691
02:19:24,179 --> 02:19:29,398
just need to be a little more mindful

3692
02:19:25,799 --> 02:19:32,099
about whether we're like a bit whether

3693
02:19:29,398 --> 02:19:34,079
the claims we're making are 100 genuine

3694
02:19:32,099 --> 02:19:36,120
and as I said I think they're a really

3695
02:19:34,079 --> 02:19:37,920
strong arguments to make that are true

3696
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:40,079
saying it's you know it's less hard yeah

3697
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:42,840
really but I think that we just need to

3698
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:45,840
get out of this space of like it causes

3699
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:49,079
zero harm because the reality is any

3700
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:51,719
smoke in your lungs long term will cause

3701
02:19:49,079 --> 02:19:53,340
damage it's just that simple yeah and um

3702
02:19:51,719 --> 02:19:56,279
I think a lot of people think well it's

3703
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:58,319
better than tobacco and I'd say 100 150

3704
02:19:56,280 --> 02:20:00,899
better than tobacco but that's not the

3705
02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:02,760
conversation the conversation is that a

3706
02:20:00,898 --> 02:20:04,680
lot of people say cannabis has zero

3707
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:06,359
negative effects and I just think yeah

3708
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:07,920
it would be cool if we could all be a

3709
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:10,559
little more honest with ourselves about

3710
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:12,719
like it's not perfect but it's far

3711
02:20:10,559 --> 02:20:15,539
better than the other things no question

3712
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:18,139
but um that's my little edgy point that

3713
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:21,240
I wanted to get out there because I do

3714
02:20:18,139 --> 02:20:23,639
unfortunately see the negative impact of

3715
02:20:21,239 --> 02:20:26,219
those statements that you get these old

3716
02:20:23,639 --> 02:20:28,319
school you know doctors who are like

3717
02:20:26,219 --> 02:20:30,239
well I don't really listen to what the

3718
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:32,459
community says because they they say it

3719
02:20:30,239 --> 02:20:35,879
doesn't cause harm and I can tell you

3720
02:20:32,459 --> 02:20:37,919
clearly yeah yeah and so I did want to

3721
02:20:35,879 --> 02:20:40,920
get that out there that we can still do

3722
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:42,898
a great job advocating for cannabis and

3723
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:44,460
promoting how it's better than some of

3724
02:20:42,898 --> 02:20:48,119
the other alternative recreational

3725
02:20:44,459 --> 02:20:49,679
sources of relaxation however I just

3726
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:51,300
think we have to be a little more honest

3727
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:53,579
and recognize that it does have some

3728
02:20:51,299 --> 02:20:55,858
health effects it's not necessarily for

3729
02:20:53,579 --> 02:20:59,219
everyone but it is far better than

3730
02:20:55,859 --> 02:21:00,780
alcohol or tobacco or any of the harder

3731
02:20:59,219 --> 02:21:03,478
ones you know and I just think being

3732
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:06,180
mindful of the language we use will

3733
02:21:03,478 --> 02:21:07,799
probably help that longer term to get

3734
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:10,079
some of the more professional white

3735
02:21:07,799 --> 02:21:13,079
collared people to listen to us because

3736
02:21:10,079 --> 02:21:14,639
the reality is we know for a fact that

3737
02:21:13,079 --> 02:21:17,280
the underground Community was ahead of

3738
02:21:14,639 --> 02:21:20,519
the medical community yeah the way CBD

3739
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:22,079
has helped people clearly shows that the

3740
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:24,359
medical community was wrong they were

3741
02:21:22,079 --> 02:21:27,120
like not no benefit and then like for

3742
02:21:24,359 --> 02:21:29,760
epilepsy Clear Proof undeniable it's

3743
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:32,040
beneficial so I think we want to try to

3744
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:34,139
maintain that moral High ground and not

3745
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:36,780
seed it by making this sort of

3746
02:21:34,139 --> 02:21:38,818
Ambiguously incorrect statements and say

3747
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:40,200
look there's value we've got we've got

3748
02:21:38,818 --> 02:21:42,299
proof of it

3749
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:46,740
um but you know there are pros and cons

3750
02:21:42,299 --> 02:21:49,920
like anything sure I I I I love that

3751
02:21:46,739 --> 02:21:52,079
I think it's probably a reaction at

3752
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:55,439
least in America but probably elsewhere

3753
02:21:52,079 --> 02:21:57,959
too to where it was so demonized by

3754
02:21:55,439 --> 02:22:00,180
society and the government that you felt

3755
02:21:57,959 --> 02:22:01,259
that like talking about it in a nuanced

3756
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:04,079
way

3757
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:06,540
any anything you admitted would be used

3758
02:22:04,079 --> 02:22:08,398
as a club to beat you over keeping it

3759
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:10,859
right where they wanted it to be which

3760
02:22:08,398 --> 02:22:12,420
was totally illegal and as dangerous and

3761
02:22:10,859 --> 02:22:14,520
in America it's schedule one so it's

3762
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:16,579
right up there with you know

3763
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:19,380
um you know the worst drugs

3764
02:22:16,579 --> 02:22:22,859
methamphetamine it's not even it's worse

3765
02:22:19,379 --> 02:22:25,019
than Coke they use cocaine in uh in nose

3766
02:22:22,859 --> 02:22:28,020
surgeries so cocaine is actually

3767
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:32,040
scheduled two in in America because it

3768
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:34,200
has legitimate medical uses right uh and

3769
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:36,780
uh not that I'm advocating for that but

3770
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:39,479
by any means but I mean you know there's

3771
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:40,979
an aspect there where

3772
02:22:39,478 --> 02:22:42,239
um it hasn't really been properly

3773
02:22:40,978 --> 02:22:44,459
studied

3774
02:22:42,239 --> 02:22:46,318
for a long time

3775
02:22:44,459 --> 02:22:48,419
um and you know when they did study it

3776
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:50,579
they were looking for harm

3777
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:53,879
right and so I think we're kind of in

3778
02:22:50,579 --> 02:22:56,039
the infancy of balancing out cannabis uh

3779
02:22:53,879 --> 02:22:57,599
one thing you didn't mention you know I

3780
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:59,520
actually don't think that like you know

3781
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:01,800
Canada I don't think cannabis has ever

3782
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:03,540
killed anyone although I do think that

3783
02:23:01,799 --> 02:23:05,759
you're probably right cannabis has has

3784
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:07,859
made people do stupid things and they

3785
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:10,439
died while high that's probably true

3786
02:23:07,859 --> 02:23:12,720
right um but I have one of my really

3787
02:23:10,439 --> 02:23:14,700
close friends has cannabis hypermissive

3788
02:23:12,719 --> 02:23:17,579
syndrome right where he gets the

3789
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:19,319
vomiting and he's had to quit cannabis

3790
02:23:17,579 --> 02:23:21,539
um and it's it's pretty rare you know

3791
02:23:19,318 --> 02:23:23,159
but it does exist and everyone thinks

3792
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:25,800
it's name or this or that or whatever

3793
02:23:23,159 --> 02:23:27,539
but he grows his own

3794
02:23:25,799 --> 02:23:29,699
um and he had to give it up and you know

3795
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:31,319
it's kind of like shellfish is amazing

3796
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:33,600
for most people but some people die

3797
02:23:31,318 --> 02:23:35,760
peanut butter is amazing for most people

3798
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:37,559
but some people no not not so much you

3799
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:39,780
know people have allergies people have

3800
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:41,398
different physical makeups and different

3801
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:43,920
genes

3802
02:23:41,398 --> 02:23:45,299
um that react to certain things and so I

3803
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:46,559
agree with you I think it's mostly

3804
02:23:45,299 --> 02:23:48,898
beneficial

3805
02:23:46,559 --> 02:23:51,000
but there's it's rare in in the world

3806
02:23:48,898 --> 02:23:54,420
that everything is a perfect good or a

3807
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:56,520
perfect bad yeah I mean anything

3808
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:57,719
carcinogenic is going to kill someone I

3809
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:59,819
mean if you smoke it it's going to kill

3810
02:23:57,719 --> 02:24:02,059
you not necessarily it being cannabis

3811
02:23:59,818 --> 02:24:04,199
being the the thing killing you but the

3812
02:24:02,059 --> 02:24:06,139
carcinogenic factor from smoking

3813
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:09,180
cannabis is probably what's really

3814
02:24:06,139 --> 02:24:12,180
pepper is supposed to be slightly uh

3815
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:14,280
carcinogenic but I'm not sure yeah but

3816
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:16,859
I'm not sure it says carcinogenic is

3817
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:18,720
burning up uh you know flour or

3818
02:24:16,859 --> 02:24:21,359
something like that but the one thing

3819
02:24:18,719 --> 02:24:23,760
I'll say about that is that I don't know

3820
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:27,180
about the carcinogenic aspect of weed

3821
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:29,040
simply because we know that tens of

3822
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:31,739
millions of Americans have smoked it

3823
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:35,100
every day and plenty of other countries

3824
02:24:31,739 --> 02:24:38,280
right and in America we lose like half a

3825
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:40,739
million people a year to Tobacco illness

3826
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:43,620
and they haven't been able to pin cancer

3827
02:24:40,739 --> 02:24:45,000
on cannabis despite trying extremely

3828
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:47,220
hard

3829
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,780
um and so I think that one is still up

3830
02:24:47,219 --> 02:24:50,760
for debate

3831
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:53,520
um I agree it has a lot of tar I agree

3832
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:56,340
it has a lot of carcinogens uh in it

3833
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,020
yeah

3834
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:59,939
but you know you would think that if

3835
02:24:58,020 --> 02:25:02,760
tens of millions of Americans have

3836
02:24:59,939 --> 02:25:05,818
smoked it daily for years that you would

3837
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:06,739
have a lot of them would get sick and

3838
02:25:05,818 --> 02:25:09,959
die

3839
02:25:06,739 --> 02:25:11,579
and we haven't seen that yet so I think

3840
02:25:09,959 --> 02:25:13,500
it remains to be seen

3841
02:25:11,579 --> 02:25:15,120
because it isn't necessarily a proven

3842
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:18,120
correlation doesn't mean it hasn't been

3843
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:20,160
seen oh I agree you know and I also

3844
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:22,560
think I'll throw this out there to to go

3845
02:25:20,159 --> 02:25:26,818
on to heavy dazes Point

3846
02:25:22,559 --> 02:25:29,039
um I think that smoking flour itself out

3847
02:25:26,818 --> 02:25:31,079
of the traditional ways and bongs or

3848
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:33,780
bowls or joints or whatever has been

3849
02:25:31,079 --> 02:25:35,459
well studied for a long time

3850
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:38,939
um and I think that it's generally

3851
02:25:35,459 --> 02:25:41,879
pretty safe I don't know if all of the

3852
02:25:38,939 --> 02:25:44,040
modern dab and extracts and all these

3853
02:25:41,879 --> 02:25:46,019
other Goos that people are smoking all

3854
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:48,720
the time I don't know if those are going

3855
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:51,180
to end up being as safe

3856
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:54,000
um and I think that you know people are

3857
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:57,420
saying oh it's cannabis so it's all safe

3858
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:59,939
right but we also haven't had years and

3859
02:25:57,420 --> 02:26:02,040
years and years of people using it yet

3860
02:25:59,939 --> 02:26:04,680
to see what the effects might be later

3861
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:06,720
on I think this is a great example three

3862
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:09,300
different eras right here of of the

3863
02:26:06,719 --> 02:26:12,239
modern era the mid-era and the old era

3864
02:26:09,299 --> 02:26:14,159
of like I mean different pushbacks to

3865
02:26:12,239 --> 02:26:16,379
use a perfect example I remember when

3866
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:18,059
all my I'm not that into hash but I

3867
02:26:16,379 --> 02:26:21,239
remember when a lot of my friends would

3868
02:26:18,059 --> 02:26:24,420
smoke their Dabs out of glowing Cherry

3869
02:26:21,239 --> 02:26:27,719
bangers yeah we now know if you're

3870
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:30,059
smoking hash at 800 and 900 Degrees it's

3871
02:26:27,719 --> 02:26:32,699
creating cyanide it's creating various

3872
02:26:30,059 --> 02:26:34,500
carcinogens it's really unhealthy and no

3873
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:39,720
one does that anymore because that [Â __Â ]

3874
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:39,719
is [Â __Â ] yeah but yet yeah

3875
02:26:39,898 --> 02:26:44,879
but everyone I knew back then was like

3876
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:47,399
heating a torch until that thing was

3877
02:26:44,879 --> 02:26:49,259
glowing red and then dropping goo in it

3878
02:26:47,398 --> 02:26:50,639
and taking big hits and coughing until

3879
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:52,818
they couldn't breathe

3880
02:26:50,639 --> 02:26:56,099
it's probably not the best

3881
02:26:52,818 --> 02:26:57,420
yeah no look I'm so I'm so stoked you

3882
02:26:56,100 --> 02:26:58,920
guys brought those points out because I

3883
02:26:57,420 --> 02:27:01,379
think I could probably add a few little

3884
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:03,659
tidbits of info so in terms of when

3885
02:27:01,379 --> 02:27:06,059
you're smoking green plant matter like

3886
02:27:03,659 --> 02:27:08,939
there's no tobacco in there they've

3887
02:27:06,059 --> 02:27:11,519
actually shown that across the board

3888
02:27:08,939 --> 02:27:14,100
most plant matter when you combust it it

3889
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:16,739
turns into this molecule called 44 by

3890
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:20,220
pyridine which is basically a relatively

3891
02:27:16,739 --> 02:27:22,439
benign molecule and this is why cannabis

3892
02:27:20,219 --> 02:27:24,659
doesn't appear to increase your rate of

3893
02:27:22,439 --> 02:27:26,880
cancer per se because the molecules it

3894
02:27:24,659 --> 02:27:29,520
turns into is pretty benign

3895
02:27:26,879 --> 02:27:32,039
um what's interesting is when you smoke

3896
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:34,500
cannabis as you mentioned it produces

3897
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:36,479
more tar than the equivalent volume of

3898
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:38,398
tobacco so that one gram of cannabis

3899
02:27:36,478 --> 02:27:40,739
actually makes more tar the difference

3900
02:27:38,398 --> 02:27:42,239
is is that when you smoke cannabis in

3901
02:27:40,739 --> 02:27:44,818
your throat you have this thing called

3902
02:27:42,239 --> 02:27:46,799
the mucousillery elevator it's basically

3903
02:27:44,818 --> 02:27:49,619
like the little hairs that brush the

3904
02:27:46,799 --> 02:27:51,840
dust up out of your lungs and stops your

3905
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:53,100
lungs from getting filled with Gunk and

3906
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:56,219
what happens is when you smell my

3907
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:58,739
cannabis that become those hairs they

3908
02:27:56,219 --> 02:28:01,019
become paralyzed but after a few hours

3909
02:27:58,739 --> 02:28:03,119
they start back up and you can clear

3910
02:28:01,020 --> 02:28:05,399
that tar out so it's not actually a big

3911
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:07,500
deal even though people do like to point

3912
02:28:05,398 --> 02:28:09,358
out that cannabis produces more tar your

3913
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:10,978
body can get rid of it it sweeps it up

3914
02:28:09,359 --> 02:28:12,960
you don't recognize it goes down your

3915
02:28:10,978 --> 02:28:14,579
esophagus and you just swallow it and it

3916
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:16,739
comes out the other end what's

3917
02:28:14,579 --> 02:28:19,439
interesting though is with tobacco it

3918
02:28:16,739 --> 02:28:21,840
actually kills those hairs and the hairs

3919
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:23,460
take at least two weeks to grow back so

3920
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:25,978
as a result unless you abstain from

3921
02:28:23,459 --> 02:28:27,839
smoking tobacco for two weeks that tar

3922
02:28:25,978 --> 02:28:29,879
will accumulate in your lungs and even

3923
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:31,859
though it's less than cannabis your body

3924
02:28:29,879 --> 02:28:33,599
can't get rid of it so that's an

3925
02:28:31,859 --> 02:28:35,280
interesting sort of thing to keep in

3926
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:36,840
your stash because people love to [Â __Â ]

3927
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:38,280
on cannabis and say there's more tar and

3928
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:41,219
it's like yeah a bit sort of not

3929
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:42,359
actually an issue interestingly when we

3930
02:28:41,219 --> 02:28:45,599
look at

3931
02:28:42,359 --> 02:28:47,159
the carcinogen aspect of cannabis that

3932
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:49,439
you're right there's no proven

3933
02:28:47,159 --> 02:28:51,898
carcinogen like it's it's not going to

3934
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:54,420
give you lung cancer per se but what is

3935
02:28:51,898 --> 02:28:56,340
interesting is that when you inhale any

3936
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:59,280
smoke it essentially causes the

3937
02:28:56,340 --> 02:29:01,739
breakdown of the alveoli which long term

3938
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:04,319
is what we would call emphysema and

3939
02:29:01,739 --> 02:29:06,600
emphysema long term will turn into

3940
02:29:04,318 --> 02:29:08,159
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

3941
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:10,859
COPD

3942
02:29:08,159 --> 02:29:13,799
so the way I try to explain it to people

3943
02:29:10,859 --> 02:29:16,380
is you might think of um being exposed

3944
02:29:13,799 --> 02:29:18,959
to Asbestos and you and you could say

3945
02:29:16,379 --> 02:29:21,420
well it's not actually the asbestos that

3946
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:23,699
kills you asbestos causes mesothelioma

3947
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:25,978
and it is the mesothelioma that kills

3948
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:28,079
you and so I actually view it the same

3949
02:29:25,978 --> 02:29:31,079
way with cannabis cannabis doesn't kill

3950
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:33,719
you but it causes COPD and COPD will

3951
02:29:31,079 --> 02:29:35,939
kill you so I think it's just about like

3952
02:29:33,719 --> 02:29:38,099
sort of keeping it in perspective sort

3953
02:29:35,939 --> 02:29:39,720
of because a lot of people yeah it's

3954
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:42,540
it's hard to understand that it can kill

3955
02:29:39,719 --> 02:29:44,938
you but I because I myself used to say

3956
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:46,979
well I've never met anyone who smoked

3957
02:29:44,939 --> 02:29:48,720
pure green their whole life so it's sort

3958
02:29:46,978 --> 02:29:51,478
of hard to know because most people have

3959
02:29:48,719 --> 02:29:52,978
smoked a decent amount of tobacco so

3960
02:29:51,478 --> 02:29:55,559
it's just like it's just muddled and

3961
02:29:52,978 --> 02:29:58,619
it's like well how do you know by the

3962
02:29:55,559 --> 02:30:00,659
correlation thing because yeah yeah but

3963
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:02,520
but I have bumped into a few British

3964
02:30:00,659 --> 02:30:04,559
guys who reckon they've just smoked

3965
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:07,260
green their whole life and and they do

3966
02:30:04,559 --> 02:30:10,260
have emphysema so so it is interesting

3967
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:12,780
but but like I guess on this point I

3968
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:15,180
I've cut my usage back so that I tend to

3969
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:16,800
just consume in the evening and I think

3970
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:18,420
this has actually been really beneficial

3971
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:21,358
for just my own personal health maybe

3972
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:23,398
this is a very specific thing to me but

3973
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:25,920
but I feel like

3974
02:30:23,398 --> 02:30:28,559
um you know not having brekki bongs so

3975
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:30,478
to speak for me personally has been

3976
02:30:28,559 --> 02:30:32,340
quite beneficial and I feel like my

3977
02:30:30,478 --> 02:30:34,799
respiratory

3978
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:37,318
um capacity essentially has been better

3979
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:40,019
for that and I would just encourage

3980
02:30:37,318 --> 02:30:41,818
people to to just be mindful of this in

3981
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:44,220
the long term because you know

3982
02:30:41,818 --> 02:30:46,739
unfortunately COPD is a bit of a rough

3983
02:30:44,219 --> 02:30:48,898
one and um you know it would be it'd be

3984
02:30:46,739 --> 02:30:50,818
better to avoid it if possible but it is

3985
02:30:48,898 --> 02:30:52,199
interesting yeah the 4-4 by pyridine

3986
02:30:50,818 --> 02:30:54,119
thing I'd encourage people to look into

3987
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:56,700
it it's pretty benign

3988
02:30:54,120 --> 02:30:58,140
um and and yeah overall clearly smoking

3989
02:30:56,700 --> 02:31:00,060
weed is way better than tobacco right

3990
02:30:58,139 --> 02:31:02,760
like there's just no question about it

3991
02:31:00,059 --> 02:31:06,420
is it the Nicki or tobacco that's

3992
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:09,420
causing the um the stuff in your lungs

3993
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:11,700
to freeze we don't know yet probably

3994
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:14,398
because it has its Vapes are so young

3995
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:17,579
nicotine and tobacco are always mixed in

3996
02:31:14,398 --> 02:31:19,318
the same thing right yeah I mean yes I

3997
02:31:17,579 --> 02:31:21,359
saw this big study and I can't say what

3998
02:31:19,318 --> 02:31:22,739
it is right now I apologize but I did

3999
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:26,159
see this thing where it was like they

4000
02:31:22,739 --> 02:31:29,879
studied a huge amount of non-smokers

4001
02:31:26,159 --> 02:31:32,520
weed smokers only weed and tobacco and

4002
02:31:29,879 --> 02:31:37,019
just tobacco and the highest rate of

4003
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:39,600
lung cancer was tobacco followed by weed

4004
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:43,380
and tobacco but then strangely the

4005
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:45,899
control group the normal lung cancer was

4006
02:31:43,379 --> 02:31:47,818
third and the people that had the least

4007
02:31:45,898 --> 02:31:50,099
amount of lung cancer were the people

4008
02:31:47,818 --> 02:31:53,459
that smoked cannabis only

4009
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:55,079
yeah um but as heavy days says you know

4010
02:31:53,459 --> 02:31:56,818
just because it protects you from one

4011
02:31:55,079 --> 02:31:59,398
thing doesn't mean it doesn't increase

4012
02:31:56,818 --> 02:32:01,260
your risk for something else to come

4013
02:31:59,398 --> 02:32:03,840
along and harm you

4014
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:06,059
um you know uh and so a lot of times we

4015
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:08,219
oversimplify things by being like see it

4016
02:32:06,059 --> 02:32:10,439
prevents this so it's all good I've seen

4017
02:32:08,219 --> 02:32:12,898
that it causes this so it's so it's all

4018
02:32:10,439 --> 02:32:16,020
bad I've seen that with CBD in the USA

4019
02:32:12,898 --> 02:32:18,420
it's it's a literal snake oil show here

4020
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:20,520
with CBD literally it is being sold in

4021
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:22,859
every gas station now like in at least

4022
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:26,399
in my area every gas station carries

4023
02:32:22,859 --> 02:32:28,079
some sort of CBD Contraption or uh CBD

4024
02:32:26,398 --> 02:32:30,779
flower even they sell everywhere you

4025
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:33,359
know and it's being sold like if you

4026
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:35,220
talk to like you know my chicks parents

4027
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:38,040
or whoever they really have this idea

4028
02:32:35,219 --> 02:32:40,978
that CBD cures everything every last

4029
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:43,080
thing there's this weird thing that we

4030
02:32:40,978 --> 02:32:44,579
won't know for probably decades but like

4031
02:32:43,079 --> 02:32:46,200
since you're in the in the medical

4032
02:32:44,579 --> 02:32:48,420
profession maybe some you know people

4033
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:50,040
are going to push it along but you know

4034
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:52,139
these guys in Israel we legitimate

4035
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:54,180
definitely have a cannabinoid system

4036
02:32:52,139 --> 02:32:58,199
right

4037
02:32:54,180 --> 02:33:00,479
um in our body and CBD and THC interacts

4038
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:03,300
with that cannabinoid system and it's

4039
02:33:00,478 --> 02:33:04,619
pretty unstudied and we don't exactly

4040
02:33:03,299 --> 02:33:07,379
know

4041
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:09,660
um what how you know what it affects you

4042
02:33:07,379 --> 02:33:11,159
know it's it's one of the body systems

4043
02:33:09,659 --> 02:33:13,260
that I think is the most poorly

4044
02:33:11,159 --> 02:33:16,318
understood because they only discovered

4045
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:18,059
it in the late 80s early 90s and they

4046
02:33:16,318 --> 02:33:20,398
don't know how cannabis and CBD

4047
02:33:18,059 --> 02:33:22,019
interacts with your you know your

4048
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:24,000
cannabinoid system or even what your

4049
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:27,060
cannabinoid system totally does in

4050
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:30,780
relationship to the rest of your body

4051
02:33:27,059 --> 02:33:32,279
um so I think people uh forget that you

4052
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:34,260
know we know a lot

4053
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:36,720
but that you know we only figured out

4054
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:38,939
what bacteria was like 130 years ago or

4055
02:33:36,719 --> 02:33:42,000
something and we still have a vast

4056
02:33:38,939 --> 02:33:43,680
amount of of things to learn and we're

4057
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:46,379
going to be surprised

4058
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:48,000
you know yeah when I was when I was a

4059
02:33:46,379 --> 02:33:49,799
kid heavy days

4060
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:53,299
um they they told everyone that that

4061
02:33:49,799 --> 02:33:55,739
margarine was clearly Superior to butter

4062
02:33:53,299 --> 02:33:59,398
now they have a much different opinion

4063
02:33:55,739 --> 02:34:01,619
of trans fatty acids you know

4064
02:33:59,398 --> 02:34:03,898
um you know people have things change

4065
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:06,960
new evidence comes in and it changes

4066
02:34:03,898 --> 02:34:08,760
people's perspectives so you know I

4067
02:34:06,959 --> 02:34:10,818
don't know where it's gonna lead but I

4068
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:14,100
do think it's it's being studied now

4069
02:34:10,818 --> 02:34:16,559
more than in any time in our history so

4070
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:19,318
I would imagine over the next 20 or 30

4071
02:34:16,559 --> 02:34:21,779
years will probably be a golden era of

4072
02:34:19,318 --> 02:34:23,539
discovering how cannabis interacts with

4073
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:26,700
human beings

4074
02:34:23,540 --> 02:34:29,399
yeah hugely hugely and I I totally agree

4075
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:32,159
with you I am 100 on the fence and

4076
02:34:29,398 --> 02:34:33,840
almost anticipating the worst with these

4077
02:34:32,159 --> 02:34:36,239
long-term bait studies coming out

4078
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:38,398
because I I agree we totally do not it

4079
02:34:36,239 --> 02:34:40,920
like I'll be honest I switched from

4080
02:34:38,398 --> 02:34:43,139
bongs to Vapes like a bit over two years

4081
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:46,020
ago thinking I was you know doing it for

4082
02:34:43,139 --> 02:34:48,420
my health and as time goes by I'm like

4083
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:49,680
man am I about to like get cancer and

4084
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:51,239
they find out like oh it turns out

4085
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:53,340
vaping's like Wayward like you know what

4086
02:34:51,239 --> 02:34:55,439
I mean like something really concerning

4087
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:57,719
but just to add one little extra little

4088
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:58,920
study Tibet in there they they did a

4089
02:34:57,719 --> 02:35:02,279
different study where they tried to

4090
02:34:58,920 --> 02:35:04,020
assess the lung function of um just pure

4091
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:05,819
cannabis smokers and what they basically

4092
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:08,220
found was if you look at lung function

4093
02:35:05,818 --> 02:35:10,859
we tend to use these two measures one's

4094
02:35:08,219 --> 02:35:12,599
called fev1 which stands for how quickly

4095
02:35:10,859 --> 02:35:15,180
can you push all the air out of your

4096
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:16,920
lungs so forced expiratory volume yeah

4097
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:18,600
and we tend to look at it over one

4098
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:20,879
second so how much can you push out in

4099
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:22,739
one second and then the other one is how

4100
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:25,318
much can you hold in total which is your

4101
02:35:22,739 --> 02:35:27,539
Force by model capacity basically what

4102
02:35:25,318 --> 02:35:29,519
they found was is that the people who

4103
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:31,620
had like older and had smoked cannabis

4104
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:34,680
their whole lives they had slightly

4105
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:36,540
smaller overall capacity which meant

4106
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:38,700
like there was some degree of emphysema

4107
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:40,979
there but they actually had a better

4108
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:42,420
fev-1 which is sort of the more one

4109
02:35:40,978 --> 02:35:45,000
you're interested in actually because

4110
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:47,639
what they basically found was a lifetime

4111
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:51,600
of ripping bongs actually strengthens

4112
02:35:47,639 --> 02:35:53,579
your lungs that's [Â __Â ] hilarious I'm

4113
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:55,739
not even kidding and like they were

4114
02:35:53,579 --> 02:35:57,600
basically like they found it a lifetime

4115
02:35:55,739 --> 02:35:59,340
of ripping cones gave you the same

4116
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:01,380
benefits as someone who was like a diver

4117
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:03,659
their whole life who worked at holding

4118
02:36:01,379 --> 02:36:06,179
their breath and like there's real

4119
02:36:03,659 --> 02:36:07,680
benefits associated with it and they

4120
02:36:06,180 --> 02:36:09,780
basically were like yeah like a little

4121
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:12,540
bit less total volume but like your use

4122
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:15,060
of the space is superior to someone who

4123
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:17,220
hasn't smoked that's might be my

4124
02:36:15,059 --> 02:36:19,859
favorite part of the whole interview uh

4125
02:36:17,219 --> 02:36:23,659
that I've been I've been training my

4126
02:36:19,859 --> 02:36:23,659
whole life just dedicated

4127
02:36:23,898 --> 02:36:28,978
I I smoke you know bongs or what that's

4128
02:36:26,939 --> 02:36:30,960
my primary delivery system

4129
02:36:28,978 --> 02:36:33,539
it's the one I find the most convenient

4130
02:36:30,959 --> 02:36:35,898
mm-hmm yeah I see the shape the shapes

4131
02:36:33,540 --> 02:36:38,760
of his bunks are very phallic

4132
02:36:35,898 --> 02:36:40,379
they tend to be that way they do they

4133
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:43,920
tend to be phallic you know they tend to

4134
02:36:40,379 --> 02:36:46,398
be a tube with a bass you know so so it

4135
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:48,299
ergonomically fits in the mouth yeah

4136
02:36:46,398 --> 02:36:50,159
ergonomically just slides right in

4137
02:36:48,299 --> 02:36:52,559
you'll see it you'll see it when you

4138
02:36:50,159 --> 02:36:54,799
come when coming you have to know heavy

4139
02:36:52,559 --> 02:36:58,559
days that once every episode

4140
02:36:54,799 --> 02:37:00,299
Matt tries to get me to Break by

4141
02:36:58,559 --> 02:37:03,059
throwing out usually some kind of

4142
02:37:00,299 --> 02:37:05,459
phallic reference and tries to get me to

4143
02:37:03,059 --> 02:37:07,379
crack better arrests throw me off my

4144
02:37:05,459 --> 02:37:08,818
train of thought so he was running out

4145
02:37:07,379 --> 02:37:12,539
of time and he probably realized he

4146
02:37:08,818 --> 02:37:15,978
needed to get it in uh I love that I I'm

4147
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:19,979
trying to be cognizant of the time

4148
02:37:15,978 --> 02:37:21,478
we could do I always remembered um when

4149
02:37:19,978 --> 02:37:23,039
I interviewed Bodhi he did something

4150
02:37:21,478 --> 02:37:24,959
very different and he was like I would

4151
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:26,939
love to give people some um book

4152
02:37:24,959 --> 02:37:28,379
recommendations is there any chance I

4153
02:37:26,939 --> 02:37:30,659
might be able to do that do that let's

4154
02:37:28,379 --> 02:37:32,099
do it yeah yes please cool cool so I've

4155
02:37:30,659 --> 02:37:33,840
always thought if I could recommend a

4156
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:35,760
few books to people like not necessarily

4157
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:37,380
cannabis specific but just no just

4158
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:39,180
things that are good reads

4159
02:37:37,379 --> 02:37:41,879
um so I think one of the most

4160
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:43,260
influential books in my life

4161
02:37:41,879 --> 02:37:45,599
um is definitely one called the body

4162
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:49,200
keeps the score by Bessel Van Der cook

4163
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:51,300
it's a book largely speaking about

4164
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:53,399
um people who have trauma and how you

4165
02:37:51,299 --> 02:37:54,840
can help them overcome that and I think

4166
02:37:53,398 --> 02:37:56,519
that it's very interesting because it

4167
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:58,859
speaks about how a lot of psychological

4168
02:37:56,520 --> 02:38:00,239
problems manifest physically you hear

4169
02:37:58,859 --> 02:38:02,280
people talking about tents in the

4170
02:38:00,239 --> 02:38:03,840
shoulders and anyway it was a seminal

4171
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:05,880
literature when it came out the body

4172
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:07,079
keeps the score Bessel Vandercook very

4173
02:38:05,879 --> 02:38:10,139
good book

4174

um likewise the 48 Laws of Power and the

4175
02:38:10,139 --> 02:38:15,599

know an absolute staple yeah please

4179
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:25,380
consider that one I've recently really

4180
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:28,439
gotten into rum Das and I like walking

each other home and becoming nobody uh

4182
02:38:28,439 --> 02:38:32,460
me and Bodie have had some really nice

4183
02:38:30,299 --> 02:38:35,219
chats about those books so I think you

4184
02:38:32,459 --> 02:38:37,619
would vibe those if you like that

4185
02:38:35,219 --> 02:38:40,199
um Oliver Sacks the man who mistook his

4186
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:42,140
wife for a heart and Awakenings are two

4187
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:44,760
very interesting books if you like

4188
02:38:42,139 --> 02:38:45,959
neurology and how things can go wrong I

4189
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:48,300
do have that one now I was trying to

4190
02:38:45,959 --> 02:38:52,438
remember what that was yeah yeah

4191
02:38:48,299 --> 02:38:54,779
um and then uh the extreme ownership and

4192
02:38:52,439 --> 02:38:57,600
the dichotomy of leadership by Jocko

4193
02:38:54,780 --> 02:38:59,399
willink are both very good books if you

4194
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:01,439
like that sort of accountability style

4195
02:38:59,398 --> 02:39:05,219
of things which I'm I'm pretty into

4196
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:07,380
myself yeah and then finally uh my two

4197
02:39:05,219 --> 02:39:09,358
final ones not gonna hurt me by David

4198
02:39:07,379 --> 02:39:11,519
Goggins is possibly my favorite book

4199
02:39:09,359 --> 02:39:12,540
ever so check that out but likewise if

4200
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:14,579
you want to learn a little bit about

4201
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:16,740
Australian history I strongly recommend

4202
02:39:14,579 --> 02:39:19,978
you to check out a book called Dark emu

4203
02:39:16,739 --> 02:39:21,780
by Brooke Bruce Pasco I I doubt anyone

4204
02:39:19,978 --> 02:39:25,139
listening has heard of it it's a book

4205
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:26,880
that largely speaking when people came

4206
02:39:25,139 --> 02:39:29,039
and colonized Australia they very much

4207
02:39:26,879 --> 02:39:30,719
whitewashed the Aboriginal history and

4208
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:33,420
said that they were a very primitive

4209
02:39:30,719 --> 02:39:36,420
people and violent and blah blah blah

4210
02:39:33,420 --> 02:39:38,639
and this book really outlines how in

4211
02:39:36,420 --> 02:39:40,559
many aspects of their society they were

4212
02:39:38,639 --> 02:39:42,539
far more advanced than us and so I'd

4213
02:39:40,559 --> 02:39:44,699
highly recommend check out dark emu by

4214
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:46,080
Bruce Pascoe it's amazing how that

4215
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:47,819
happened to the Native American culture

4216
02:39:46,079 --> 02:39:50,039
here over there just to any native

4217
02:39:47,818 --> 02:39:51,260
culture that were you know terrorized by

4218
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:54,600
European

4219
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:57,600
kids I generally think as far as humans

4220
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:59,659
go to be fair uh any group that comes in

4221
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:02,399
that's that's uh more technical

4222
02:39:59,659 --> 02:40:03,959
technologically advanced especially with

4223
02:40:02,398 --> 02:40:06,119
weapons

4224
02:40:03,959 --> 02:40:07,799
um that tends to be bad for the local

4225
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:10,200
population

4226
02:40:07,799 --> 02:40:11,879
um you know uh the uh the Mongols

4227
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:13,319
weren't European but you sure probably

4228
02:40:11,879 --> 02:40:14,938
didn't want them showing up to your city

4229
02:40:13,318 --> 02:40:17,279
you know

4230
02:40:14,939 --> 02:40:19,680
um and you know Europeans we get we get

4231
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:21,120
a we get a wrap because we colonized

4232
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:23,460
everywhere and it's a lot more recent

4233
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:25,260
and it's very well documented

4234
02:40:23,459 --> 02:40:28,438
um but it's certainly it's a human

4235
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:29,760
failing unfortunately where uh lots of

4236
02:40:28,439 --> 02:40:30,898
cultures I mean they used the first

4237
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:32,760
thing they used to do when they took

4238
02:40:30,898 --> 02:40:34,318
over a culture was burn the libraries

4239
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:37,200
and burn the knowledge

4240
02:40:34,318 --> 02:40:39,119
you know um and so you know there's uh

4241
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:42,359
there's aspects to that

4242
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:43,920
you know uh that uh that suck but it's

4243
02:40:42,359 --> 02:40:47,280
part of the human experience I think

4244
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:48,478
nothing recommendations

4245
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:51,720
I'm gonna throw out some book

4246
02:40:48,478 --> 02:40:54,239
recommendations uh do it uh that some of

4247
02:40:51,719 --> 02:40:55,019
the I'll start with some like some uh I

4248
02:40:54,239 --> 02:40:57,539
don't know necessarily they're not

4249
02:40:55,020 --> 02:41:00,120
weed-based necessarily but they they

4250
02:40:57,540 --> 02:41:03,140
they maybe inform your experience uh one

4251
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:06,300
of them is called uh the NAT the the

4252
02:41:03,139 --> 02:41:07,619
natural mind right and it's a book by

4253
02:41:06,299 --> 02:41:11,219
Andrew Weil

4254
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:13,920
and it's kind of a a study on why people

4255
02:41:11,219 --> 02:41:15,299
like to change their headspace why

4256
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:18,120
people like Altered States Of

4257
02:41:15,299 --> 02:41:19,619
Consciousness how normal it is for

4258
02:41:18,120 --> 02:41:21,479
people to want to alter their

4259
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:24,359
Consciousness and how many different

4260
02:41:21,478 --> 02:41:26,879
creative things come out of them putting

4261
02:41:24,359 --> 02:41:28,439
yourself in a different perspective

4262
02:41:26,879 --> 02:41:29,938
um and I'll just I'll move on but one of

4263
02:41:28,439 --> 02:41:32,280
the coolest things he says usually the

4264
02:41:29,939 --> 02:41:34,079
first time that people get high is these

4265
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:36,180
like little kids spinning around in

4266
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:38,100
circles until they get so dizzy they

4267
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:41,100
can't stand up and they fall over

4268
02:41:38,100 --> 02:41:43,439
and that's usually the first change in

4269
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:45,420
Consciousness that people actually

4270
02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:47,100
experience and it's almost Universal

4271
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:48,960
right

4272
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:50,520
um so he got really famous for like

4273
02:41:48,959 --> 02:41:52,199
writing a bunch of self-help books and

4274
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:54,120
stuff like that but

4275
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:57,120
um that book came out in the 70s when he

4276
02:41:54,120 --> 02:41:59,340
was still a researcher uh you know and

4277
02:41:57,120 --> 02:42:02,399
and it's really interesting take on why

4278
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:06,780
our mind likes having a change in

4279
02:42:02,398 --> 02:42:08,639
Consciousness right uh two would be uh

4280
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:10,319
another book by Andrew Weil called from

4281
02:42:08,639 --> 02:42:12,539
Chocolate to Morphine

4282
02:42:10,318 --> 02:42:15,420
and it is a book it's probably a little

4283
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:17,700
dated now but it is basically every drug

4284
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:20,100
that affects humans

4285
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:21,840
um and the most up-to-date knowledge

4286
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:24,120
good and bad on what it does to you

4287
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:26,340
without all the governmental politics

4288
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:28,140
just like he's a you know Harvard

4289
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:30,239
trained physician so he just looked at

4290
02:42:28,139 --> 02:42:34,139
it like well what is the medical say

4291
02:42:30,239 --> 02:42:36,659
about caffeine or chocolate or heroin or

4292
02:42:34,139 --> 02:42:38,818
marijuana or you know whatever it might

4293
02:42:36,659 --> 02:42:40,619
be and so if people want to read about

4294
02:42:38,818 --> 02:42:42,180
what things do to you without a bunch of

4295
02:42:40,620 --> 02:42:43,200
[Â __Â ] like we were discussing with

4296
02:42:42,180 --> 02:42:44,639
weed

4297
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:46,920
um it's you know it's a little older now

4298
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:49,500
but it's probably a pretty good start

4299
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:50,818
uh getting on to the metaphysics side of

4300
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:52,379
things like he was mentioning with ram

4301
02:42:50,818 --> 02:42:54,119
Das

4302
02:42:52,379 --> 02:42:56,279
um there's a book by the Dalai Lama that

4303
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:58,020
really affected me uh that I read when I

4304
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:59,579
was locked up which was the art of

4305
02:42:58,020 --> 02:43:01,620
happiness

4306
02:42:59,579 --> 02:43:02,760
and I don't think many people think

4307
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:04,079
about

4308
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:06,540
um happiness

4309
02:43:04,079 --> 02:43:08,700
and what happiness means in their own

4310
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:10,439
lives right and what feeling good means

4311
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:12,240
people chase all these things that their

4312
02:43:10,439 --> 02:43:14,100
parents want or their society wants or

4313
02:43:12,239 --> 02:43:16,139
what they think they want and they don't

4314
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:19,040
think about like what kind of life or

4315
02:43:16,139 --> 02:43:21,840
what kind of mental state leads to

4316
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:24,420
calmness and peace and happiness and

4317
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,920
enjoying life right and so since we all

4318
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:27,719
only know that we get this one shot

4319
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:29,239
maybe maybe not maybe not you know we

4320
02:43:27,719 --> 02:43:32,639
might as well enjoy it while we're here

4321
02:43:29,239 --> 02:43:34,859
uh and the mind is a funny thing

4322
02:43:32,639 --> 02:43:37,139
um so books that help you explore your

4323
02:43:34,859 --> 02:43:39,300
mind and explore why your mind does what

4324
02:43:37,139 --> 02:43:40,799
it does is pretty cool

4325
02:43:39,299 --> 02:43:42,539
you know

4326
02:43:40,799 --> 02:43:44,519
um and then you know speaking to the

4327
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:45,899
aboriginey side of things there's a book

4328
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:47,579
by Howard Zinn that's kind of

4329
02:43:45,898 --> 02:43:50,039
controversial it's called a people's

4330
02:43:47,579 --> 02:43:52,620
History of the United States

4331
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:54,479
um but it was basically written about

4332
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:56,819
all the people you know mostly we write

4333
02:43:54,478 --> 02:43:58,379
about like powerful white people that

4334
02:43:56,818 --> 02:44:00,719
had all these big effects on the world

4335
02:43:58,379 --> 02:44:02,459
and they sort of take it from like a

4336
02:44:00,719 --> 02:44:04,139
native's perspective or a woman's

4337
02:44:02,459 --> 02:44:05,579
perspective or a black person's

4338
02:44:04,139 --> 02:44:07,858
perspective or an immigrant's

4339
02:44:05,579 --> 02:44:09,180
perspective like what was America like

4340
02:44:07,859 --> 02:44:10,800
for them

4341
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:12,840
right

4342
02:44:10,799 --> 02:44:14,818
um and so just you know any book that

4343
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:16,920
that gets you out of your comfort zone a

4344
02:44:14,818 --> 02:44:19,079
little bit or teaches you something

4345
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:21,780
um about the world uh books are how we

4346
02:44:19,079 --> 02:44:23,340
pass knowledge down and so I'm a big fan

4347
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:24,960

knowledge out there and it's good so we

02:45:08,520 --> 02:45:12,780
I would say like you know shout out to

4372
02:45:09,959 --> 02:45:15,000
anyone who's ever been on the show

4373
02:45:12,780 --> 02:45:18,239
um and you know everyone who's been on

4374
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,978
the show has helped uh steer me in some

4375
02:45:18,239 --> 02:45:22,799
form or another and I'm very grateful

4376
02:45:19,978 --> 02:45:24,420
for that hopefully whether the steering

4377
02:45:22,799 --> 02:45:26,938
was positive or negative I've hopefully

4378
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:29,818
come out a bit better the other side

4379
02:45:26,939 --> 02:45:31,739
um and a huge shout out to everyone in

4380
02:45:29,818 --> 02:45:33,959
the Australian scene who's trying hard

4381
02:45:31,739 --> 02:45:36,359
to help promote it I know that things

4382
02:45:33,959 --> 02:45:38,219
are still very fledgling and it's easy

4383
02:45:36,359 --> 02:45:40,380
to look at the states and to feel like

4384
02:45:38,219 --> 02:45:41,579
we're so far behind but I genuinely

4385
02:45:40,379 --> 02:45:43,379
believe there's a lot of people in

4386
02:45:41,579 --> 02:45:45,299
Australia who are both passionate and

4387
02:45:43,379 --> 02:45:46,799
are really putting their mind to it to

4388
02:45:45,299 --> 02:45:49,318
try to progress things along and that's

4389
02:45:46,799 --> 02:45:50,938
cool and furthermore

4390
02:45:49,318 --> 02:45:52,920
um you know like a shout out to all the

4391
02:45:50,939 --> 02:45:54,840
people who you know we stand on the

4392
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:57,659
shoulder of giants you know to anyone

4393
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:59,460
who's ever given me any work that I've

4394
02:45:57,659 --> 02:46:01,439
used for everyone who's just been a part

4395
02:45:59,459 --> 02:46:03,000
of the scene before me

4396
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:04,920
um I certainly couldn't be here without

4397
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:07,620
all of the knowledge from those who have

4398
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:10,739
walked the path before us and so I try

4399
02:46:07,620 --> 02:46:13,140
to always be very grateful for that and

4400
02:46:10,739 --> 02:46:15,059

it's people that are seeking like some

4416

kind of path to history and cannabis so

4417
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:45,720
