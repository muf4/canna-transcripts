00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,919
oh man i i got a ton of questions

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,559
one question around you know kind of

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,719
antic antagonistic behavior uh there's a

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,320
lot of rumors that you had a secret

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,718
twitter account and you would kind of

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
semi publicly post under a

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,000
different name uh can you confirm it and

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
i have you ever you know posted or

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,118
interacted with ufo twitter from an

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,640
account other than the official willows

12
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,079
i'm an intel guy

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,240
i mean

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,719
i collected that man

15
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,320
it's not a yes or no but but

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,920
you know there's a lot of things that

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,238
people do to confirm and deny

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,480
information and to to see if it's if

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,280
something's real and legit

20
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,959
um so you know i'm not saying that i did

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
maybe friends of mine had or family

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,679
members had but you know

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,760
collecting intel is is

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,878
what i do that's always been what i've

25
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,399
done and so you know people are i'm not

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,079
going to confirm it a knife i've had

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,439
another account on i mean first of all i

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,840
don't like social media i i do look at

29
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,039
social media from my my twitter account

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,960
which is the only thing i have i don't

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,280
have instagram or anything else

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,919
um simply because people are willing to

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,118
take the time to write something i think

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,400
they at least owe eyes on it right so

35
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,319
someone's going to take the time to say

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
hey lou uh i really liked what you did

37
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,839
or hey lulu that really sucks what you

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
did um you know

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,359
honestly there's a couple times where

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
people have called me out thankfully

41
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,319
because i may have made a mistake as

42
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,239
everybody knows right on my twitter page

43
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,239
one of my my tendencies i will always

44
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,078
hold myself accountable and there's been

45
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,839
i think two or three instances where

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,118
i've said something it either wasn't

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
taken properly or maybe i

48
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,680
miscommunicated it and within 24 hours

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,599
of it being brought to my attention i

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
readdressed it i said oh hey mia coppa

51
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,078
guys you know great catch great call you

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,759
know this was my intent apologies if it

53
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,519
was lost in translation or if i made

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
mistakes something that wasn't my

55
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,599
intention and you know here

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,960
here we here we go so i think um

57
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,039
you know that's that's that's one of the

58
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,839
ways to hold yourself accountable is is

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,680
through

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
through listening to people even even

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
with dissenting views again not

62
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,118
not the hecklers out there people that

63
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,118
are just trying to cause drama and

64
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,400
trauma that's not that's i don't look at

65
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,479
those uh but people who have honest

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,200
questions or comments or concerns

67
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,119
i look at those

68
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,519
um what are any other follow-up

69
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,319
questions rather before we get to our

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
i appreciate that uh yeah

71
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,519

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,879
let me um

88
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,239
let me give a little bit more direct

89
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,359
answer to to rather here um

90
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,560
look there's things that i do with

91
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
because i have that blue little check

92
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,560
mark

93
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,919
on my on my name that actually hinders

94
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,439
me from doing a lot of things that i may

95
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,878
want to do if i want to get on twitter

96
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,959
and ask somebody about

97
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,919
purple curtains um

98
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,360
you know if i do that it's it's it gets

99
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,639
really tough

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
so

101
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,878
it's common for a lot of people to use

102
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,759
anonymity in order to to to research

103
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,840
things

104
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,798
um i'll you know i'll ask you the

105
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,319
question

106
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
rather um

107
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,439
you know

108
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,679
some people say well why would you want

109
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,680
to be anonymous well but let's face it i

110
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,719
i doubt that your real name is rather be

111
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
splitting

112
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,439
yet you use it because it's helpful and

113
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,920
effective because you're not quite

114
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,919
comfortable providing out your your

115
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,559
personal information

116
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,318
i get it and i respect that

117
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
but the same holds true for other people

118
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,878
the same feelings and concerns and fears

119
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,639
you may have is precisely the same

120
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,079
concerns and fears that other people

121
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,399
have and probably including myself

122
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,280
that's a great i mean yeah i feel like

123
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,319
it's a soft yes but i think it's a great

124
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,919
answer man and and um yeah what do you

125
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,280
what were you gonna say rather

126
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,679
well yeah actually it's not a crime

127
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,878
right no it's definitely not a crime

128
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
that's for sure

129
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,719
but there is kind of a weird dynamic

130
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,720
going on in ufo twitter and i think that

131
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
you know there was a an account that was

132
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,080
almost an open secret that was yours and

133
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,918
i'm not sure if this one actually was

134
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,758
yours or not but there's a lot of people

135
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,680
on you know your supporters who would

136
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,199
kind of clamor and

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,439
on to what that would say and kind of

138
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,280
you know rallying cry and it it seems to

139
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,319
kind of stoke fires a division rather

140
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,758
than you know uniting people and uh

141
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,439
you know frankly i found that a little

142
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
disappointing if that account really was

143
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,519
yours but you know i do understand well

144
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,240
i don't know you you haven't asked me

145
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,599
and let me ask you this bureaucrat one

146
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
right now

147
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
i

148
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,758
i see that on there right now that it's

149
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,839
not me right now i'll tell you that yeah

150
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,319
it was that account was deleted i think

151
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,079
in november and someone took it over

152
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,399
um so so that account that's posting

153
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,439
right now definitely isn't you but so so

154
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,399
let me ask you another question

155
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,399
if i may rather um if i if i called your

156
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,918
mother a hooker

157
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,359
how would you now being honest i'm not

158
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,519
that i'm not saying that i'm asking you

159
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,319
hypothetically if i were to call your

160
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,120
mother a prostitute

161
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,478
or

162
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,560
your partner or your kid

163
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,199
how would you feel about that

164
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,600
yeah i i would not like that i

165
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
i hope you don't know those implications

166
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
no no no and i'm not by the way for the

167
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,639
record i'm not saying that but i'm

168
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,160
asking you a hypothetical that you now

169
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,280
being out okay let's say rather be

170
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
squinting what's your real name and

171
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,519
everybody who you were and people were

172
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,439
were calling your family people

173
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,399
disparaging things like that

174
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,639
knowing

175
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,079
that it wasn't true and knowing that you

176
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,560
couldn't come out and defend yourself

177
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,159
publicly because it would never stop the

178
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,839
moment you feed the seagulls more and

179
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,880
more seagulls come right the more yeah

180
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,079
the trolls more and more trolls come so

181
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,279
yeah so i'm asked hypothetical how would

182
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,279
you

183
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,399
deal with that a to set the record

184
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,918
straight with facts and data okay

185
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,519
at the same time trying to to

186
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:16,719
to

187
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:18,879
continue to fill a type of behavior

188
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,479
people do do make disparaging comments

189
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,918
on me uh all the time about twitter and

190
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,079
stuff and i personally i think the best

191
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,399
strategy is just to ignore it you know

192
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,839
it's it's

193
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,318
you know usually

194
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,318
traders

195
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,199
well but understood if i were to accuse

196
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,440
you of a crime and you don't address it

197
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,199
i call you i say you know what i caught

198
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,560
you yesterday breaking and entering into

199
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,840
a neighbor's house stealing everything

200
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,600
that they have and killing their dog and

201
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,038
leaving and by the way i've got proof

202
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,639
and evidence to show it

203
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,240
it would depend on who's saying that

204
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
right if it's someone of your stature

205
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,240
stature i probably would feel like i had

206
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,079
to respond but if it's just some person

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,720
anonymous person on the internet i would

208
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,800
not respond see i disagree i think an

209
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,039
anonymous someone on on the internet is

210
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,120
has just as much voice as i do with the

211
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,639
blue check or anybody else this is where

212
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
you and i disagree

213
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,000
i think that's fair everybody every

214
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,080
person in your audience right now that's

215
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,918
listening has just as much

216
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,159
of an opinion and entitled to their

217
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,719
opinion as you do and as i do and as

218
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,319
everybody else that's where i disagree

219
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,919
just because you and i have a microphone

220
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,319
in front of us doesn't make either one

221
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,399
of us higher statute or more important

222
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,960
it makes us more of a target for sure

223
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,038
and more susceptible to the hatred but i

224
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,399
i it doesn't make the sting or the pain

225
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,279
go any less

226
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,478
and

227
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,079
you know i've

228
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,719
maybe i'm a bit old-fashioned i'd come

229
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,240
from a long family of revolutionaries my

230
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
father was in the bay

231
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
you know

232
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,239
i chose a career that tends to be a

233
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,280
little bit i guess

234
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,840
somewhat similar um but to me

235
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,318
you know people are the most important

236
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,198
aspect of any conversation the entire

237
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
topic of ufos and uaps doesn't mean

238
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,319
anything if you don't have the

239
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,399
conversation about people themselves and

240
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,639
what it means because ultimately

241
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,120
it's how we deal with information as a

242
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,800
species which is going to dictate how we

243
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,879
deal with the topic of ufos and

244
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
therefore i think everybody should be

245
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,639
part of that conversation everybody's

246
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,759
entitled to an opinion and everybody's

247
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,000
opinion should be taken equally until at

248
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,598
which point it's proven that they're not

249
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
that they they don't they don't have

250
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,399
equal voice because they're not

251
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
interested in the truth they're just

252
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,878
interested in agitation and again

253
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
let me let me say this i'm not attacking

254
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,879
you at all rather i'm just i'm playing

255
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,879
devil's advocate here because you ask me

256
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,479
a very direct you ask me a very direct

257
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,680
question and i think you deserve a very

258
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,719
direct response but also one that that

259
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,519
that is helps me explain my position on

260
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,200
the topic i think everybody is entitled

261
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
to defend themselves and i think it's

262
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,959
terrible and repulsive when people can

263
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,480
say things and you are expected not to

264
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,919
defend yourself especially your

265
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,759
credibility when you've defended and

266
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,799
fought for your country people friends

267
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,879
have died

268
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,120
for that privilege i take that very

269
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,039
seriously when people accuse my wife or

270
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,039
my kids of something yes i take that

271
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,439
very seriously and that's part of the

272
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,439
problem i think with with society today

273
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
we don't have honor we've lost that

274
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
somewhere we've lost

275
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,399
the fact that

276
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,239
defending your loved ones and defending

277
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,080
your friends and your family is

278
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,919
something we should be doing

279
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
and anybody who takes those attacks

280
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,639
there should be consequences unless you

281
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,958
have damn proof and evidence and i this

282
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,759
is why we are in the situation we are in

283
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,119
as a society because no one is held

284
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,360
accountable

285
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,600
no one's held accountable and i think i

286
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,200
personally think it's it's i think it's

287
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,040
disgusting i think this is why we're in

288
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,959
the situation we are right now and again

289
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,719
i'm not playing again not not attacking

290
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,479
you here rather than just giving you my

291
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,879
honest feeling in my opinion from my

292
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,800
heart so yeah i'd just like to add you

293
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,399
know all the the attacks that are on

294
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,838
foot or anyone who's paying attention at

295
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,080
all can can see right through that and

296
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,920
that's obvious bs all that all that

297
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,800
stuff so you know i i commend you and i

298
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,879
can see how that would be you know

299
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,519
not not make you feel great and you yeah

300
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,360
i want to respond but yeah it is it is

301
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,959
yes in my opinion as well

302
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
i mean look we're humans
