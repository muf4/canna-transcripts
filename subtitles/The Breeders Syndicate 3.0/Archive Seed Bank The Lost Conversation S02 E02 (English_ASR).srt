[Music]

8
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,000
hey what's going on

9
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,799
so in like 0.405

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,840
i was on cannabis world

11
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,399
um

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,039
and i got the green bubba the purple

13
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,520
bubba both from ken oregon kid and then

14
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
i had a shaw bud

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,079
who is 707 seed bank

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,118
his bubba kush cut they were all called

17
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,239
bubba

18
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,040
um

19
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,438
ken called the purple fino which was uh

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
supposedly an s1

21
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,319
uh

22
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,560
that some club owner in the in the

23
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,559
valley made um

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,680
it was really heavy yielding made like

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,478
club type nuggets with the rounded top

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,040
um the katsu uh

27
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,519
cut um

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
i as far as i know and i can't remember

29
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,840
specifically but i'm pretty sure that

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,920
was the cut that he sold to katsu right

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,200
and that was the green fino and then

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,280
shaw bud aka 707 seed bank

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
um his uh

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,640
his bubba cut was um

35
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,559
the pre-98 and so basically what

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,478
happened is i had all three cuts i need

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
to label them in my room so that i would

38
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,519
could tell the difference or you know so

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,840
i could

40
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,718
uh maintain mothers and know which ones

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640
which

42
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,718
um and it just got the name pre-98

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
because shaw had

44
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,839
um

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,280
received the cutting in the in the

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,280
winter of 97 98 so at the time it's like

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,919
2003 i'm like well it had to have been

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,479
before 1998 because someone popped the

49
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,839
seeds and has a clone by now already

50
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:25,039
it's pre-98 right that's how it got the

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,878
name um and that was like 2004

52
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,439
and then it was like three or four years

53
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:33,439
later that swerve basically appropriated

54
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,439
the name for selling seeds yeah

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,400
so that's pretty much all there is to it

56
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,080
it wasn't anything special it wasn't

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
there wasn't anything crazy about it

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,160
what was the difference between shaw's

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
and like the katsu

60
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,400
they all pretty much smell the same the

61
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,080
purple was like a little bit more purple

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
smelling but still the bubba with the

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
incense and the like um

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,599
the smell in the air the same meaty

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
smell

66
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:01,199
um the katsu they they would all turn

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360
purple depending on how you grew them

68
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,719
right so they're all phenotypically

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,440
variable based on environment um

70
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,199
it was the green pheno was the the katsu

71
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,359
which um

72
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,119
it just tended to be green more often

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,760
but if you over further it didn't veg it

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,519
very big whatever it put out little tiny

75
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,318
buds it turned purple at the end of

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,200
flower with cold temperatures no

77
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,919
not a major difference the pre-98 tended

78
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,518
to be a little chunkier more often but

79
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,878
still the same characteristics as the

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,000
other two cuts it would still um

81
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,639
uh

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,039
uh like basically what i call like big

83
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,719
stem small bud yeah

84
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,000
right where you've given it too much cal

85
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,840
mag or

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,080
it doesn't have a big enough root system

87
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,959
for the size of pot it's in whatever

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
right

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,400
um if you vet it look just like most

90
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,679
bubbas if you vet them out really big

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,438
they'll start actually producing pretty

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,799
good

93
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,000
that's [ __ ] awesome dude that was a

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,000
lot of [ __ ] i didn't even know about

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,479
bubba i'm glad you said that um people

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
were asking about the face-off story uh

97
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,840
that would be [ __ ] awesome to hear

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,479
like straight from the mouth

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,000
so the real og cushman the source

100
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,318
genetics chris

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,360
chris used to live up here in seattle in

102
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,039
2000 and um

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
i think he lives up here from like 02 to

104
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,560
06.

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,120
i met him in like 04 um

106
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,680
and he was growing the poison og at the

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
time which was his bad seed fino

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,319
um from bags that he had purchased in

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,120
socal the face-off was and i think he

110
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,519
had 12 seeds of face-off bag seeds the

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,519
face-off was never actually a clone that

112
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,639
was being grown it was just a moniker

113
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,359
given to

114
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,840
a certain batch of og that went through

115
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,439
the inland empire back in like 99 or

116
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,758
something like that

117
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,519
um i got six of the seeds i think four

118
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
or five of them popped if i remember

119
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,719
right the face off number four is the

120
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,439
cutting that i have right um i popped it

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,479
from c um

122
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,038
so

123
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,560
that's the only real face off really i i

124
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,360
mean i think there's like four or five

125
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,360
more seeds out there chris gave some to

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
cult classic seeds but i don't think he

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,120
ever popped them and i'd be surprised if

128
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:15,120
they even popped now being 20 years old

129
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,280
no and uh

130
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
i think chris might have a couple more

131
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,279
seeds of it but that's about it that's

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,879
pretty awesome so like though i i

133
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,638
thought the seeds it was the number four

134
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,439
fino the number one two and three the

135
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,918
number one was like uh

136
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,079
it like the leaves turned purple it had

137
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,399
more of like a in between bubba and

138
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,159
face-off kind of smell yeah um

139
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,758
the number two was like this really

140
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280
short sativa um leaf looking thing but

141
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,038
it didn't stretch at all it was almost

142
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,959
like a dwarf plant but it had really

143
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,279
really thin blades

144
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,758
um the number three produced

145
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,119
like much larger bigger colas was a

146
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,479
little bit hermey

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,759
which was one of the main reasons i

148
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,000
didn't keep it and it pretty much

149
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,680
smelled like your typical og made with

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,560
like a little bit of a gummy bear funk

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,079
oh wow and then the number four

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
and and that the number three and the

153
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,959
number one kind of had that similar like

154
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,360
gummy bear in between og and bubba kind

155
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,439
of smell the number three was more og

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
dom the number one was like

157
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,199
it wasn't really bubba dum i would say

158
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,479
but it was just kind of

159
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,439
um

160
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,038
i would call it blander but you know

161
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,120
it it wasn't anything particularly

162
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,199
special and then the number four

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,038
was um

164
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,960
the uh

165
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,959
it based it's that it's that face-off

166
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,439
smell like that really long-lasting

167
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,478
lingering after flavor and a real cushy

168
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,199
flavor

169
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,360
um and the main reason i kept it too was

170
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,280
its potency it's always potent like the

171
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,800
first time i was smoking it i uh rolled

172
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,239
up a joint was driving to town to pick

173
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,240
up some hydro gear

174
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,519
this was like 2006 and i smoked that and

175
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,960
started getting like light-headed in the

176
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,519
car and i was like all right well this

177
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,959
thing's pretty potent probably um and

178
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,399
anybody that knows me knows i smoke a

179
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,000
lot of herbs so

180
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,399
um i i typically don't even comment on

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,519
potency at all because i'm smoking 20 or

182
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,959
50 different strains yeah a day

183
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,159
you know between all the different kinds

184
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,000
of hashes and whatever else so

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
that's fascinating dude i'm sure people

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,598
appreciated hearing all that now i have

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,439
a question something i'm interested in

188
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,478
that i don't know a lot about other than

189
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:22,240
uh probably jason king's uh cannonball

190
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,240
dude um the purple indica

191
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,199
told me it's the one clone that i don't

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,280
know that i don't want

193
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,280
yeah it's um

194
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,559
it's super hard to work with i mean it's

195
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,478
um

196
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,478
it's a really old strain from up here in

197
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,120
the northwest everybody that like if

198
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,079
you're around in the late 80s 90s and

199
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,879
2000 early 2000s smoking weed up here

200
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,478
you bought purple weed and it smelled

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,720
like the purple indica it's like this

202
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,079
really um

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,199
uh

204
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,439
really

205
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,120
not it well it's not i mean it's pungent

206
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,000
but it's like if you could think of what

207
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,240
the purp what purple smells like a color

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
this is everything that purple smells

209
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,478
like

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,840
um

211
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,159
and hold on a second i'm going to take a

212
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,159
token

213
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,799
um

214
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,960
and i i got the cut in 2003 it was the

215
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,360
very first cut that i got basically that

216
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,439
um it didn't come with a name either so

217
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,439
i got it from my friend who

218
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,800
had gotten a medical card at the time

219
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,800
which was uh pretty hard to get

220
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,918
and he had gotten the cut from some

221
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,918
organ growers

222
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,838
i had no idea what it was i was growing

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
some 97

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,200
dutch passion blueberry seeds at the

225
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,479
time and i also had some

226
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,158
some other blueberry seeds i can't

227
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,160
remember what they were

228
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,319
um i think they're from canada one of

229
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,199
the canadian blueberry crops like

230
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,200
yeah one of those you know um

231
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,720
i can't think of the company names but

232
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
you know [ __ ] out of cannabis culture

233
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,000
not like uh vcc depot but like

234
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,360
federation seeds all those guys i can't

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
remember who it was that had like the

236
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,680
blueberry the blueberry nl5 all that

237
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
kind of stuff i remember

238
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,120
do you ever try peak seeds

239
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,720
i do remember peak but i think this was

240
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,759
before peaks

241
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,080
um

242
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,200
i think this was uh

243
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,040
um

244
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,040
god i can't remember the name but it'll

245
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,799
come to me in a second

246
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,879
um

247
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,359
but basically i was growing blueberry at

248
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,480
the time and when when you cut up clones

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,240
of

250
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,720
the purple indica

251
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,200
it literally smells like berries kind of

252
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,480
right had a very berryish smell right

253
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,399
from the beginning which is kind of that

254
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,959
purple smell too

255
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,958
and um

256
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,000
so i would i didn't know what it was

257
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,278
right i just um i just knew that like it

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,480
kind of looked like the blueberry [ __ ]

259
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,159
so i kind of like was calling it

260
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
blueberry for a second i hadn't even

261
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,120
flowered it yet so i didn't even know i

262
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
was just like i don't know blueberry

263
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,560
something or other

264
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,320
by the time i finished the cut i knew

265
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,479
that it was one of the purple strains

266
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,760
from up here so we had the uw perp um

267
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,320
seattle perps tacoma perps ultraviolet

268
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,879
um these were all basically

269
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,800
the same phenos

270
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,120
or not the same phenos

271
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,919
they were either variations of the same

272
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,480
variety or hybrids of the same variety

273
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,159
right which was basically the old purple

274
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,079
from up here and it was like pretty

275
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,159
widespread and we knew that there was

276
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,639
multiple different cuts because

277
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,799
you could um

278
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,199
you could basically uh

279
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,799
like when you bought pounds of it you

280
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
you'd get some bags that all smelled

281
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,479
like the purple indica or like

282
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,399
ultraviolet or whatever

283
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,200
but uh if you got the perps like from

284
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
tacoma it'd have like big 20 gram colas

285
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
in it right

286
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,879
and whenever you grew like or whenever

287
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,039
you saw like ultraviolet nuggets

288
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,958
they didn't ever have uh big nuggets and

289
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,439
it was always small little ounce bags of

290
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:01,838
[ __ ] yeah and when i grew out the

291
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,800
blueberry or the unknown cut yeah um

292
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,040
uh

293
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,559
basically i start i grew it a few times

294
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,559
and i was like there's no way that this

295
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,559
is the tacoma cutting i don't know if

296
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,559
it's the ultraviolet i don't know if

297
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,000
it's the uw perp i don't really know

298
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,159
what cut it is because i don't have

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,679
anything to reference it by

300
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,240
in terms of other cuts so i called it

301
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,799
purple indica yeah that was how it got

302
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,839
its name right it got so it became pi

303
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,519
right

304
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,399
um

305
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,078
and

306
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,759
basically you know

307
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,759
there never really was a purple indica

308
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,679
up here as far as i know

309
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,200
it was just the perps

310
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,679
so

311
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,680
um and it's just a really really tight

312
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,958
it's not tiny it's not like a dwarf or

313
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,278
anything but it's a very tight internode

314
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,278
um afghani plant

315
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,720
um pretty much anybody i know that's

316
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,360
twice my age that's up here in

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,278
washington they immediately can identify

318
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,720
it as the old perp

319
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,759
um

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,440
from up here uh kindness cannabis he's

321
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,159
one of my buddies from back in the day

322
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,760
he remembers it really well too

323
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,639
um

324
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:10,480
and that's what the pi was and it's it's

325
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,000
lower potency um that you know 15 to 18

326
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
percent and pretty much whatever you

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
cross it to it reduces its potency okay

328
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,839
so uh [ __ ] plant though

329
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,839
yeah and it's just hard to work with

330
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,440
from from the perspective of trying to

331
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,600
um uh

332
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,200
it's trying to bring a new variety up to

333
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
modern day standards

334
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
it's you know it's

335
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,799
sometimes you cross stuff in and it like

336
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,399
like cookies for example you cross it

337
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,919
into stuff and it makes it really frosty

338
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,159
and purple which is what the market

339
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,559
likes yeah you cross the pi and it makes

340
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,919
it less frosty

341
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,919
dark purple

342
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,799
and not quite as potent but the the

343
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:54,479
funny thing is the potency is um

344
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:57,359
is so subjective yeah nowadays

345
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,879
that like back then the purple indica we

346
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,879
always called it shut up wheat because

347
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,639
anybody you load a bomb toke or whatever

348
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,159
for they'd immediately just sit there

349
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,600
and zone out

350
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,799
so even though it always tests

351
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,759
significantly

352
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,879
um lower potency than a lot of stuff

353
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,278
it um it definitely uh

354
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,200
would bring some people's bells sure

355
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,799
that makes sense dude

356
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,720
you know i've noticed a lot of these uh

357
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,639
lower potency strains are coming around

358
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,680
more now since since concentrates are

359
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,360
much more

360
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:31,439
in use and available it seems like

361
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,800
they've gotten a renewed life in them

362
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
yeah a little bit but i mean you know

363
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,240
lower potency means lower yields

364
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,278
as well right

365
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,159
so

366
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:39,519
um

367
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,879
i think a lot of people are just trying

368
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,240
to

369
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,838
get as much bang for their buck

370
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,879
especially from an economic perspective

371
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,000
oh sure

372
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,600
sure

373
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,879
so what are you working on now i think

374
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,959
that's what a lot of people like to know

375
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,120
about you what are you working on now

376
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,719
[ __ ] amazing [ __ ] yoshido that's

377

i mean it's you know it's it's all

379
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,919
personal preference i

mean um i'm actually gonna pop all my

381
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,000
old seeds all everything from 10 or 15

382
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,600
years ago this next round right now i'm

383
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,639
remaking

384
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
um

385
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,959
all the stock right of stuff that's

386
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,799
already i've already gone through

387
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,559
um

388
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,000
and then uh i'm just gonna i'm gonna go

389
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,919
back to the drawing board i'm tired of

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,198
the [ __ ] i'm working on i can't wait to

391
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,599
[ __ ] see what you pull up from your

392
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,000
collection i can't even imagine

393
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,360
yeah um i mean [ __ ] gets boring you know

394
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
to me

395
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
um

396
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
and that's why people are like oh

397
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,839
someone else made your [ __ ] before you

398
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
could it's like dude i was working on

399
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,480
trying to find something new not

400
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,159
remaking

401
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,278
[ __ ] just because people are asking for

402
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,799
it so

403
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,480
it's all personal preference you know

404
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,639
and what your motivation is and it's all

405
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,320
about i mean anybody can make your [ __ ]

406
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,360
before you if they don't test it release

407
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,440
it right like yeah of course exactly if

408
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,120
you're not going to work it at all

409
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,560
i mean you can make it as fast as

410
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,759
someone can sell it basically yeah so

411
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,479
um you know docido took a while to make

412
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,319
in a remake because it's uh the ogkb is

413
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,159
like a type 4 hermes that thing hermes

414
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,079
every which way you can possibly get so

415
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,000
hybridizing into it you've got to at

416
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,958
least search through the population and

417
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,639
look for lower instances of those traits

418
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,159
and anybody that's not or even doesn't

419
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,519
even know about that obviously doesn't

420
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,000
even probably grow their own [ __ ]

421
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,519
seeds so

422
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,278
yeah

423
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,600
everybody's gonna be [ __ ] bombing you

424
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,439

it

429
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,320
i agree

430
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,639
especially if it's a

431
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,560
half year line in the thing

432
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,680
right well i mean yeah exactly and it's

433
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,039
like well

434
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,120
you know if

435
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,759
if people are mad about the name or

436
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,360
whatever the the funniest [ __ ] is

437
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,199
they're the ones complaining about

438
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,600
patents on plants

439
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,399
but want trademark rights for naming

440
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
[ __ ]

441
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,360
it's you know

442
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,720
you can't you can't have your cake and

443
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,399
eat it too you got to be one or the

444
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,199
other because that's how patents and

445
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,519
trademarks work it's not

446
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,359
it's i mean you know i think

447
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,519
hypocrisy is the

448
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,759
the a lot of people's motives so

449
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,360
whatever it's fine i mean miseducation

450
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
leads to it and it's all right it's what

451
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
the world is nowadays yeah that's very

452
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,240
true

453
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
what else you guys got for him any other

454
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,480

455
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,720
sitting here don't ask [ __ ] lame ass

456
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,920
[ __ ]

457
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
yeah who wants to talk about purple

458
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,159
punch anyway exactly seriously

459
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,039
let's talk about some [ __ ] historical

460
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,600
[ __ ]

461
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,000
let's stop you know what yeah hp 13 uh

462
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,759
the most common uh misinformation about

463
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,958
it is that it's g13 hash plan i think

464
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,959
most people think that because of

465
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,479
[ __ ] retards and haven't looked up

466
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,479
anything can you tell us about the

467
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
experience with hp 13 it's not something

468
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,360
many people talk about

469
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,519
so i i got the cut i think from caleb um

470
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,000
i think he was the one that got it first

471
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,320
um but i had seen it earlier um for

472
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,720
example like uh in you're talking about

473
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,278
jason king's cannabis earlier so the can

474
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,120
of bible entry that was my herb

475
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,640
um the trinity crossed with u-dub that

476
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,639

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,640
showed to um

478
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,679
uh jason king at the 2002 seattle hemp

479
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,959
fest

480
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,679
um

481
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,038
the dog [ __ ] that's in there that was us

482
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,798
not the humble

483
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,480
outdoor pictures but the pictures of the

484
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,639
indoor that was my buddy cannabis

485
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,120
reverend yeah um through another

486
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,400
glassblower friend of ours that grew it

487
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,399
um

488
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
that was the dog [ __ ] entry that was in

489
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,000
there

490
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,880
um the purple indica entry that was mine

and then scott uh reach also reached out

492
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,240
to jason king and i think showed him

493
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,839

495
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,798

and uh

497
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,519
so

498
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,960
the first time i saw hp 13 was in 2004 i

499
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,119
went to stay with a friend of mine in

00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,879
about the party even though they don't

507
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,798
throw it anymore but it was basically a

508
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,240
weed gathering party another another

509
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,558
couple buddies of mine that currently

510
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,200
live on maui and it was basically like

511
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:21,839
it was deep in the [ __ ] jungle it was

512
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,360
um off uh grid so there's there's no i

513
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,279
mean they had power because it's like a

514
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,279
multi-millionaire's home that was this

515
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,798
thing getting thrown at so they had

516
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,558
refrigerators and all the nines but it

517
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,519
was actually an off-grid home

518
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:36,558
and uh you know they had like cava leaf

519
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,480
blunts and [ __ ] homemade kombucha and

520
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,558
like homemade uh

521
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,759
beer and all kinds of [ __ ]

522
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,119
and um jason king also happened to be

523
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,960
there that was the first time i saw

524
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,399
mendo perps also

525
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,240
um that was like 2004 i believe

526
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,200
um yeah it was 2004. and uh

527
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
so

528
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
hp 13

529
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,559
i'd heard about it uh everybody had

530
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,279
talked about it i saw some jungle grown

531
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,759
hp 13 that was grown deep in the jungle

532
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,839
there and i thought it was swag it was

533
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,519
like but it was just poorly grown

534
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,558
um i thought it had a really unique

535
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,480
smell

536
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,440
but it had like no stickiness to the

537
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,440
resin

538
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,679
the smell i had to really mash it up

539
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,279
because it was that outdoor [ __ ] yeah

540
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,880
and um

541
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,160
but you could tell it had like a unique

542
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,400
smell to it

543
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,160
and then i eventually got the the cut

544
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,120
from csi humboldt

545
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
and i think that was probably around

546
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:31,439
2007 or eight was the first time i got

547
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
it

548
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
um from him

549
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,119
and uh

550
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,679
it's it was like it's a weird plant you

551
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,479
know it's um it's pretty leafy

552
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
um very columnar growth just like goes

553
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,919
straight up

554
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,839
didn't branch very much small yield and

555
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,840
definitely hermit on the bottoms

556
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,839
um and that's where like the p or the uh

557
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,639
the [ __ ] what did they call it

558
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,558
the the sour p which is the sour diesel

559
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,720
hp 13 cross

560
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,678
um that was all the same group of cats

561
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,279
that did this maui party um every year

562
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
back then

563
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,000
and uh

564
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,240
i still have some friends from those

565
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,919
parties that that live all over and you

566
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,599
know they they remember the stuff one of

567
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,360
the one of the most impressive examples

568
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,119
that i remembered was

569
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,158
the um

570
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,479
uh jasmine jack which came out of eugene

571
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,720
um and that was it was real hazy

572
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,839
smelling but at the time like uh in

573
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,679
seattle

574
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,519
uh hazy stuff was like where it was at

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,679
um all that [ __ ] was um

580
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,519

581
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,280
popular like i remember when i first got

588
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,558
even it was it was pointless

589
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,880
yeah i just was growing it because i

590
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,720

030405 og wasn't really that popular or

593
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,359
known outside of los angeles yeah

594
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,960
that's so dude i i can't ever get

595
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
anybody knowledgeable to comp or comment

596
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,400
on hp 13 and it seems like everybody who

597
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,000
grows it or has run it has different

598
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,240
opinions on whether it's worth keeping

599
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,839
whether it's worth growing but uh that's

600
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,839
pretty fascinating dude i appreciate

601
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,759
that yeah the the people that i know it

602
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,519
came from the people that jason king saw

603
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,279
it from originally the people that put

604
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,279
it in the can of bible

605
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,200
those dudes were from new york it's from

606
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,519
new york right it is from new york then

607
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,840
for sure that's my understanding like i

608
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,440
i the the farthest back that i have any

609
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,720
experience with it and the people that

610
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,080
it came from

611
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,720
they had a new york connection and

612
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,918
that's where that cut came from wow okay

613
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,440
cool yeah i've always wondered because

614
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,120
you always see it in new york and maui

615
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,679
new york yeah that's why they had the

616
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,599
sauer d out there too right at the same

617
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,400
time that was all the same group of

618
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,439
people and um you know the scene was

619
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
really small 15 20 years ago especially

620
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,640
genetics scene back then because most

621
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200
people all they gave a [ __ ] about was

622
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,880
just finding one good cut and running it

623
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,000
till the wheels fall off that was like

624
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,360
the deal

625
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,880
um

626
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,879
no one it didn't really matter what the

627
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,720
strain name was in those days because

628
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,360
everything's sold for great money oh

629
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,360
sure sure i've seen him [ __ ] growing

630
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,399
in maui growing [ __ ] plants and trees

631
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,399
and [ __ ]

632
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,960
[ __ ] gnarly out there

633
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,519
yeah that was how that hp 13 that i

634
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,480
first saw was grown and it was garbage

635
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,440
honestly it was pretty much garbage

636
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,519
i mean

637
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,519
i would be nice about it but it dude

638
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,000
ryan trying [ __ ] in the jungle is

639
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,480
impossible yeah exactly like i remember

640
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,319
i would ship out um a jar of weed like i

641
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,038
shipped out a jar of albert walker for

642
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,480
that party in 2004 and literally as soon

643
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,720
as i opened that jar my buddy's house

644
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,200
the weed got wet yeah you know it was

645
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,200
like cured perfectly and was like spongy

646
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,519
with the with the crack as soon as you

647
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,279
open the jar it's it turns into like

648
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,558
jungle weed yeah just drinking that

649
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,480
humidity

650
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,399
yeah the huma it's like 98 percent you

651
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,839
may are 100 humidity it's like raining

652
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,759
basically so

653
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,918
um as soon as you open the jar it just

654
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,038
takes it it takes it all on

655
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,038
[ __ ]

hybridize i saw rich in here earlier

663
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,079

682
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,759
didn't expect

683
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,960
i had no idea until i moved back up to

684
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,919

685
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,759
um

686
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,880
and then started working with my buddy

687
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,879
in oregon

688
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
uh did i even know that there was a cut

689
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,600
out there called snoopy sacks so

690
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,200
i mean

691
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,798
is that what the dog walker cuts called

692
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,360
scooby snacks

693
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,759
no dog scooby snacks says dog walker and

694
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,079
forum cookies okay

695
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,319
right i didn't know that either

696
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,519
yeah yeah i mean i'm you know rich is

697
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,599
still in here

698
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,759
i'm sure he can uh

699
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,399
he can uh tell everybody but yeah the

700
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,319
dog walker which is our walker og i'm

701
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,600
not i'm not sure who made that side of

702
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,240
it um

703
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,000
and then that hybridized with chem 91 or

704
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,759
chem 4 i can't remember if rich found

705
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
out which one it is i think he ended up

706
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,200
saying chem 4 is what he was told yeah

707
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,038
yeah so i think it was supposed to be

708
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,798
cam 91 ended up being chem 4 i

709
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,038
personally prefer the flavor of chem 4

710
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,038
so yeah

711
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,720

712
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,240

um it was just bulk like basically skunk

831
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,038
number one hybrids um because that's

832
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,360
what i mean i think sam skunk man was

833
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,440
selling like millions of skunk one

834
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,759
hybrids back in those days to all the

835
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,840
seed distributor guys and they would all

836
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,839
just like package it up and sell it give

837
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,839
it away as freebies or whatever it was

838
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,398
you know

839
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,000
um

840
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,918
and uh

841
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,398
yeah it was just that you know it was

842
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,399
that cross with ogers and then ken grew

843
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,798
it so it was probably one of sam's uh

844
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,719
skunk one hybrid says the 60 40 based on

845
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,720
the smell and and like the way the plant

846
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,919
grows the fact that it washes well all

847
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,679
that stuff

848
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,480
um leads me to believe that it's

849
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,559
probably um

850
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,839
probably some skunk number one cross

851
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,440
just like pretty much everything else

852
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,079
that i've grown from that era from

853
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,600

854
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,000

944
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,240
originally called electric boogaloo

945
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,159

957
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,319
all i ever remember about it was really

958
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,918
was that it had like a i saw a couple

959

uh but all of them were like very burnt

962
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,399

966
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,000

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,120
um

970
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,720
better than uh

971
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,559
then it smelled i remember being the

972
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,720
opposite it's smelling really good and

973
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,799
not really having a ton of flavor

974
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,000
the trinity cut that i've been smoking

975
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,440
that uh

976
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,599
came through like the natsu dog and

977
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,280
those guys have and caleb that one that

978
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,039
one kind of tasted me like the old elvis

979
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,560
cut which is real interesting i'm not

980
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,559
sure if it is the old trinity or not but

981
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,398
i they're saying it is

982
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,599
yeah i haven't i haven't seen it so i

983
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,960
really don't know

984
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,800
um

985
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,039
the uh

986
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,200
like i said the trinity that i remember

987
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,239
all of them smelled like straight burnt

988
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,638
rubber

989
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,519
afghani punk and it was pretty strong

990
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,679
smelling but there was no sweetness at

991
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,119
all to it there was no fruitiness there

992
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,000
was no like

993
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,559
off smell it was just basically burnt

994
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,878
rubber i think if people confuse that

995
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,559
anything that's not sweet but that's

996
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,559
funky with skunk

997
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,838
uh i've been seeing that a lot lately

998
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,358
anything that's not fruity they call

999
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,519
skunk but

1000
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:03,279
i think it also has to do with like i

1001
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,679
know when i've stopped smoking for

1002
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,119
periods of months and stuff

1003
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:12,399
everything smells way skunkier yeah

1004
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,800
like og smells like skunk ken sauer kush

1005
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,800
that thing was [ __ ] super skunky i

1006
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,680
mean like if you think gmo

1007
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,880
has that bad breath whatever smell

1008
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,759
abs ass ask about the original sour cush

1009
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,400
cut

1010
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,079
that um oregon kid can put out there

1011
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,960
that thing was [ __ ]

1012
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,640
ridiculous right i mean comparatively it

1013
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,880
shits on gmo in terms of that wow raw

1014
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,039
halitosis og

1015
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,640
punk right yeah actually which is

1016
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,880
totally different than the burnt rubber

1017
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,879
i don't know i mean it is it's just

1018
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,640
experience i think you have to have seen

1019
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,440
it to know the difference absolutely

1020
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,920
yeah

1021
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,240
i think that's everything

1022
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,240
we got

1023
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,960
blue dot

1024
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,440
707 seed bake he knows more about that

1025
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,639
than anybody i mean that was like a club

1026
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,240
cut that used to go through the third

1027
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,440
floor at oakland that's all i remember

1028
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,799
about it

1029
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,559
um

1030
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,880
i've seen some blue dot over the years

1031
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,519
but whether or not it was like

1032
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,440
um the blue dot that everybody talks

1033
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,199
about i have no clue right the one that

1034
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,800
i saw wasn't that impressive so it leads

1035
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,919
me to believe that either

1036
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,240
people are smoking bam or weed or i got

1037
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,880
the wrong i saw the wrong [ __ ]

1038
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,959
you never know yeah well i mean i've

1039
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,640

maui dog or whatever it is that's all i

1051
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,039

1052
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,039
bunch of different stuff but i've never

1053
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,119
really seen enough um

1054
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,000
about it the oregon pineapple someone

1055
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,838
said

1056
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,039
um

1057
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,199
i don't remember a whole lot i just

1058
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,358
remember buying that herb um i remember

1059
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,199
seeing the pineapple ds i remember it

1060
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,440
reminding me of the hawaiian indica [ __ ]

1061
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,199
that was going around yeah and that's

1062
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,800
what it rumored to be and i think that

1063
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,319
you know that hawaiian indica line was

1064
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
like pretty popular there for a few

1065
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,400
years

1066
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:23,119
uh one more quick one uh your collab the

1067
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,519
tie with uh with uh with casas

1068
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,079
yeah that was chris's brother's cut um

1069
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,400
he lived in portland

1070
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,320
chris gave me that cut uh when he

1071
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,920
i think when he moved back or actually i

1072
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,760
think i got it from his buddy up here a

1073
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,920
couple years after he moved back to la

1074
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,920
something like that

1075
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,320
and i i had uh seeded it up with the

1076
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,599
face off i never sold seeds of it yeah

1077
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,720
um

1078
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,400

um

1083
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,960
and i gave chris a handful of those

1084
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,039
seeds and he's he's gonna work it just

1085
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,519
partly in homage to his brother that tie

1086
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,358
was really interesting it definitely

1087
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,000
it was like um

1088
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,239
it was like bubble gum and burnt onion

1089
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,519
or not burnt onion but like uh like a

1090
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:14,479
really strong cutting onion smell

1091
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,920
and uh bubble gum and like a little bit

1092
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,719
of the super silver haze yeah uh hazy

1093
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,800
back end but not not really like when

1094
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,559
you smell it you don't think haze it's

1095
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,560
mostly that like

1096
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,400
a tropical

1097
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,759
uh cut onion

1098
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,400
uh

1099
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,160
type of smell it's pretty unique then oh

1100
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,559
it's super unique and it was it was

1101
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:39,598
stunk and i mean it did like the classic

1102
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:40,799
uh little um bananas all up the calluses

1103
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,039
yeah up the

1104
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,680
on the top colas when it finished up

1105
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,679
just like the milli two yep

1106
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,919
what uh here's a good one and we can't

1107
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,039
end with this this thing's almost over

1108
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
um

1109
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,119
what what project are you most proud of

1110
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,320
like looking back on what you've done to

1111
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,280
this point what are you most proud of

1112
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,559
oh man i'm just one cog in the wheel

1113
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,720
like i'm not

1114
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:07,279
i just was preserving genetics because i

1115
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,039
thought it was important and at the time

1116
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,480
um

1117
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,920
a lot of other people were getting rid

1118
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,480
of everything because it was starting to

1119
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,320
become like a marketing game right it

1120
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,320
used to be able you could grow dog [ __ ]

1121
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,039
and it'd still sell in fact it was the

1122
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,960
most in demand product yeah ten years

1123
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,800
later it was the opposite right nobody

1124
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,880
wanted the long forex tivas people

1125
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,400
didn't like smoking them anymore

1126
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,720
um

1127
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,358
it had become more of a marketing type

1128
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:36,159
of cannabis market than it was before

1129
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,078
right yeah and uh so for me as i i'm

1130
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,000
just happy that i was in the right place

1131
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,920
at the right time was able to get

1132
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,480
a lot of these really good cuts and kind

1133
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,079

1135
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,119
