[Music]

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,960
I start it I it I got

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,198
put on my way to save the

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,118
world my way to save the world got a

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,400
brand new set words and the going bre

6
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:31,960
Che a questioning believe wor got it

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,959
done with shopping but

8
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,679
I

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,719
I my way to save the

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
world my way to save the

11
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,238
world so yeah I was I was thinking of

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,079
like where to go with this because

13
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,439
you've done other shows before but I

14
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,039
think like briefly not even briefly like

15
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,518
as as much as you want to go into on

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,478
your start obviously where your interest

17
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:08,359
started how you got specifically into

18
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:12,000
like a very Niche area of like the land

19
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:14,200
race heirloom older lines you know um

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,840
yeah yeah and we have questions from

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,040
people in our Discord and I want to talk

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,359
some of the lines obviously that you

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,920
carry so it can shine some light on some

24
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,319
of those too plus I'm interested in a

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,759
lot of them and I have a bunch so yeah

26
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:27,919
yeah yeah nice um yeah uh that's cool

27
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,000
that people have sent in questions

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,879
because it's always good to sort of yeah

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,599
answer that for people because often

30
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,158
often I sort of don't realize the extent

31
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,280
I mean I do I do people mention it but

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,680
you know when people come to the site

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,200
and they're a bit overwhelmed by the

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,079
sheer quantity of stuff on there and

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,680
things like that yeah um but yeah I mean

36
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,679
um for me it was uh

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,118
something

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,719
the getting into this sort of niche as

39
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:02,799
it were was more um

40
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:05,959
the growing up in the UK in the

41
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,360
90s yeah

42
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:14,359
um some of my well in fact all of my

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,480
first encounters with cannabis were

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,800
through uh stuff that friends of mine's

45
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,039
parents had you know so sort of boomer

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,560
generation

47
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:27,000
people who would still in that era go

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,159
and you know to Nepal and places and

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,959
bring back stuff to smoke and that kind

50
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,759
of thing and then the people who I was

51
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,479
talking to it about talking to about it

52
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,479
were also of that generation and would

53
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:41,439
sort of Regale me with anecdotes about

54
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,759
smuggling hashack from Afghanistan and

55
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,479
this type of thing you know so kind

56
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,919
triggered your interest um yeah I mean

57
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,318
that was my perspective on it was that

58
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,919
that was the real cache the real kind of

59
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:57,639
um you know um

60
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,919
mythologized stuff was that old old type

61
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:02,759
of old school cannabis you know that was

62
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,559
anyway what I was kind of raised the

63
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,439
context in which I grew up into cannabis

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,199
was one in which that was always had the

65
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,280
biggest sort of prestige attached to it

66
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,318
you know these were these old kind of

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,840
like um hippie type characters you know

68
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,839
like um there probably a

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,680
slightly I mean they definitely were

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,280
back in the 60s

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,480
but um those you know they were doing

72
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,680
the hippie trail and stuff and yeah

73
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,719
doing kind of scams like that and then

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,159
as teenagers we would

75
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,878
like you know I'm talking kind

76
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:39,679
of very early 90s and things would

77
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:43,399
obviously being so close to Amsterdam in

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,319
England anyway yeah you um do we were

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,879
seeing that um people were starting to

80
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:52,679
to grow but it wasn't the indoor indoor

81
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,399
kind of domestic production in the UK

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,959
didn't really take off in a big way

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,280
until the late 90s early 2000s and

84
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,158
suddenly in the space of a couple of

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,158
years imported cannabis just disappeared

86
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,759
from the UK completely so most Imports

87
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,318
anyway if you're in the UK unless you

88
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,438
knew someone were pretty [ __ ] [ __ ]

89
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,598
Moroccan hash to be honest throughout

90
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:17,639
that era but if you did know someone you

91
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:18,599
could get you know nice swasy red sort

92
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,519
of West

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,439
African

94
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,280
Nigerian and you could still get good

95
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,839
good Moroccan and you'd see Lebanese

96
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,439
you'd see very seldom see like really

97
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,879
good Afghan to get that you'd need to go

98
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,120
to Holland or someone somewhere to

99
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,680
actually find someone who could get the

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,600
real stuff because most of what most of

101
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,519
the Afghan Pakistani type hash by that

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,840
point that you'd see in the UK was bunk

103
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,478
even though people didn't seem to

104
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,439
realize you know yeah but um but uh

105
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,038
anyway

106
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,439
so but if we did if we did see like what

107
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,959
we would call skunk and that kind of

108
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,639
stuff in the early

109
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,799
90s we'd sit you know I'd sit with my

110
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,240
friends at around

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
their house and stuff and their parents

112
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,400
would just be like oh this stuff's

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,479
terrible why are you [ __ ] touching

114
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,319
all crap you know and they just give us

115
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,879
this kind of lecture about how awful it

116
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,399
is and stuff and um so that was kind of

117
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,000
my perception anyway and then also you

118
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,679
know friends of mine who are Australians

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,639
were basically had the same attitude

120
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,519
it's like if they came around and they

121
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,120
saw and this again older generation you

122
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,719
know if they saw us growing things it'

123
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,720
be like H these aren't pure sativas you

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,840
need like proper sativas and they'd Rave

125
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,720
about Tai and Indonesian and

126
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,478
papinian sativas and stuff you know so

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,840
always my perspective anywhere was that

128
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,478
so for me it was just that was the

129
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,279
natural thing to be interested in and

130
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,038
when I did start trying to grow for

131
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:47,079
myself I sort of had this realization

132
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,079
[ __ ] hell I know where all these

133
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,599
places are I want these seeds and I can

134
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,120
see online that all these other people

135
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,759
are wanting these seeds I know where to

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,240
go to go and get them and um so it's

137
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,759
just a kind of natural progression

138
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,199
really it just um you know

139
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:07,080
uh it all kind of fell into

140
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,680
place that takes that takes connections

141
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,879
like to to track down like legitimate

142
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,680
stuff and and you seem to be quite a

143
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,079
well- read historian of cannabis and um

144
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,639
yeah I can't imagine the links that

145
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:23,079
you've had to go to to to even to bring

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,840
out a lot of this old stuff and a lot of

147
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:30,719
the the land race stuff as

148
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:33,719
well um I would say it's partly

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,960
become possible because of spending

150
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,080
enough time in these places

151
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:43,638
that um you get to know people and they

152
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,639
trust you enough you know yeah abolutely

153
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:52,598
uh it it really varies though because

154
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:55,120
some some bits of some bits of the

155
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:57,839
um of Asia

156
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,199
anyway it's not really that you need

157
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,959
particularly to have connections you

158
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,759
just need to know where the places are

159
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:08,560
you know yeah so

160
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,879
um you know you can you can go to this

161
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,759
as long as you know where the places are

162
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,520
in a lot of in a lot of the more Central

163
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,038
Asian Parts it's actually quite a lot

164
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,478
easier because it's it's really the

165
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,199
tropics where it's more tricky because

166
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:25,439
there's no reason to have seeds in the

167
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,199
tropics other than to grow C you know

168
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,639
it's not like their food or something

169
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,639
like in Nepal some of the landr types

170
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,800
anyway as much as anything are

171
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,560
cultivated for the seeds you know yeah

172
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,478
so there are some areas where and and

173
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,079
the same actually is kind of true in in

174
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:45,959
even in um uh the Hindu Kush you know is

175
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,719
the seeds are a winter food source as

176
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,839
well so you could sh yeah yeah yeah

177
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,639
people this is a really overlooked thing

178
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,679
actually like even amongst the experts

179
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,720
people seem to realize

180
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,319
that cannabis is a multi-purpose crop in

181
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,080
all of the North areas like including

182
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,879
Afghanistan and the Hindu Kush the only

183
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,758
bit where it's not a multi-purpose crop

184
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,039
is in the tropical areas where where is

185
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,120
ganja which is s the semi sensy whatever

186
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,878
you want to call it that's the only

187
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,199
where it's a single purpose crop it is

188
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,319
only grown for producing the buds you

189
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,158
know guess that makes sense too with the

190
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,158
hash with the hash production and stuff

191
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:25,199
because they could still collect the

192
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:28,319
hash and harvest the seeds yeah yeah so

193
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,680
you know um sometimes like um I've read

194
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,959
people like David Watson Sam skunkman

195
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,200
saying you know we tried really hard to

196
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,239
um persuade the Afghans to like grow the

197
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,080
crop as since Amil and like they just

198
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,399
actually just weren interested and

199
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,200
there's a pretty good reason for that

200
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,159
which is that actually the seeds are are

201
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,680
very important winter food source

202
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:53,039
they're very high in you know important

203
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:55,679
fats and proteins as well and

204
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,078
particularly in the mountains that's

205
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,199
really necessary because obviously you

206
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:01,799
can't keep like huge her of animals very

207
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,240
easily in in the mountains you can have

208
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,879
a few cows and goats and stuff but it's

209
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,000
not like um there's a there's a there's

210
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,559
a huge demand for land and water and

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,958
everything in in any mountain area and

212
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,679
so you know if you

213
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:20,319
can have that extra source of protein

214
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:23,039
and fats it's it's pretty essential

215
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,399
actually you know I

216
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,679
would some of the Mid Eastern places

217
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,278
would be super hard to U make those

218
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,919
connection especially nowadays um I

219
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,240
remember hearing even Neville's story

220
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,078
back with

221
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:40,440
um I think Clive I think that's what he

222
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:44,239
goes by um when they went to I think it

223
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,240
was Afghanistan and one of them OD in a

224
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
hut and they were you know trying to

225
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,919
kick in their door and whatnot that

226
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,919
that's how the story went anyways so I

227
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,679
can only imagine how crazy it is to try

228
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,679
to get inroads in there nowadays with

229
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,719
the political

230
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,479
climate um I mean one thing one thing

231
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,519
I'd pick up on first is just in terms of

232
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,240
thinking about the geography of cannabis

233
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,600
um Afghanistan I think if you if you

234
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,480
want to have a kind of

235
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,680
clear just because I think it's really

236
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
helpful you know with with everything is

237
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,199
like context is everything and and for

238
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,360
cannabis it's really good to get the

239
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,360
geographical and cultural context kind

240
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,480
of on a basic kind of map in your mind

241
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,560
as it were and I would say Afghanistan

242
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,839
is best thought of it's like Southern

243
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,439
Central Asia so Central Asia rather than

244
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,399
the Middle East is how I would talk

245
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,800
about it in terms because it's um that's

246
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,559
the really Central you know in what we

247
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,519
call indicas in the sort of loose sense

248
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,759
colloquial sense are a Central Asian

249
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,240
domesticate basically and so Afghanistan

250
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,480
is really sort of the Southern edge of

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,759
Central Asia and um rather than the

252
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,720
Middle East I think if you is Middle

253
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,759
East is s more sort of

254
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,160
confusing confusing term yeah yeah

255
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,759
um because you know it connects

256
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,958
Afghanistan really sort of connects in a

257
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,360
cannabis sense with shinjang and places

258
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,759
like that which is eastern central Asia

259
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
yeah bukara is sort of really you know

260
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,200
Central Central Asia as it were and

261
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,839
those are all

262
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,680
historically very connected

263
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:25,920
important cannabis centers in terms of

264
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:29,919
the sort of Inda type yeah races um but

265
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,599
yeah going to those places um

266
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,639
yeah I mean it's been it's been

267
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,360
increasingly difficult

268
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:40,879
um especially with the uh Taliban being

269
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:45,278
allowed to kind of yeah retake the

270
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:48,200
entire place and stuff but um yeah and

271
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:51,320
you know there is also yeah the fact the

272
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,600
other definitely one thing I found going

273
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,240
to those bits of the world is that the

274
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,200
the culture of kind of opium and stuff

275
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,799
does um mix with the Cannabis culture

276
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,560
quite a lot and I definitely met

277
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,199
characters who were having problems with

278
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,479
things like you know

279
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,720
harder substances like

280
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,039
heroin yeah but

281
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,360
um

282
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,719
the yeah I mean it's there's there's

283
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,959
various ways to do these things I mean

284
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,240
some of the people who were helping us

285
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:26,119
for a while were were were stringers for

286
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,879
for media um and journalism in fact all

287
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,440
of the people I know

288
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:34,039
who I from these places who were were

289
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,240
were working as stringers and which

290
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,039
means sort of

291
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,720
helping

292
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,240
um you know journalists and media

293
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,199
companies who who want to make

294
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,198
Productions in those areas to to meet

295
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:48,639
the people find the right places doing

296
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:50,958
that kind of job and then they would um

297
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,839
just have a sideline in like helping

298
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,679
collect seeds for us basically you know

299
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,560
and then obviously once

300
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:04,039
the once the um the

301
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:07,000
the um Biden sort of pulled the plug on

302
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:09,078
air support for and tax support and

303
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,839
everything for the Afghan Army and it

304
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:17,278
just got overrun and most of them had to

305
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:19,360
then um spend the next sort of you know

306
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,838
half a year in like safe houses trying

307
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,399
not to get

308
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,680
executed

309
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,039
J yeah it's not great it gives you a

310
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,399
different perspective on these things

311
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,519
because everyone's sort of like I mean

312
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,919
you know

313
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,720
detour too far into politics but I

314
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:38,399
thought the whole that whole

315
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,240
um post 911 Adventure was just

316
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,519
completely misguided but it's like once

317
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,000
they've actually committed to it to then

318
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,360
just suddenly [ __ ] turn around and

319
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,559
say actually you know what [ __ ] that

320
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,320
we're just going to leave and not even

321
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:52,638
tell you yeah was just a just an

322
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,839
astonishing [ __ ] betrayal but

323
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,879
everyone was exping it so it's American

324
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,279
that's what they do it's it is between

325
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,159
extremes there's no sort of just seems

326
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,000
to be incapable of finding a kind of

327
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,838
sensible middle ground on foreign policy

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,600
to yeah always going one way or the

329
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,560
other too far it's like oh we don't want

330
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,879
nothing to do with it oh we're all in oh

331
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,879
we want nothing to do with it oh we're

332
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,159
all in it's like Jesus man just [ __ ]

333
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,879
you know this insane ISM that seems to

334
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,759
[ __ ] infect all the thinking about it

335
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,759
leaving all the caches of weapons and

336
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,759
whatnot too just to find their their

337
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,680
homes to wherever

338
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,720
fuing do something Ukraine the way it's

339
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:39,758
going so let just gift them the entire

340
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,240
[ __ ] um anyway but yeah um it's it's

341
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,199
it's um but yeah so yeah I mean that's

342
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,919
that's mostly what I've seen of it is

343
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:50,879
the the post 911 kind of version of the

344
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,319
hippie Trail so it is quite hard to

345
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,360
avoid the political aspects of it

346
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,440
because it absolutely the landscape so

347
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,560
transformed by the time I got to see

348
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,040
most of it like it you know the context

349
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,879
in which I saw people smoking a lot were

350
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,958
like um security guards and sort of yeah

351
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,240
you know sort of those kind of

352
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,078
characters like sitting around like with

353
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,360
like you

354
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:20,000
know guns and stuff outside places like

355
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,399
embassies and hotels and whatever you

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,559
know very publicly smoking hash and

357
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,159
things it's like there sort of there's a

358
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:31,119
whole um Marshal kind of militant not

359
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,278
mil you know

360
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,799
um Warfare type context of cannabis use

361
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,879
there and things that I started to

362
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,919
realiz yeah it's not just a sort of um

363
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,639
the the hippie Trail stereotypes of sort

364
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,958
of spiritual use and things are actually

365
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,360
just one side of the the culture of

366
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,919
cannabis there's whole ranges of of ways

367
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,720
it's used traditionally that aren't

368
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,599
necessarily part of the main Western

369
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,240
discourse of like Oriental cannabis

370
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,920
culture you know yeah that's that's part

371
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,680
of the story that fascinates me because

372
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,519
it's it's a lot of the stuff that even

373
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,958
as deep into cannabis history and stuff

374
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,639
as I am that's like not something I'm

375
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,518
really super familiar with so I don't

376
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,959
speak on it you know I don't know it but

377
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,839
you're the type of person that I can

378
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,958
speak to that has a lot more insight

379
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,639
into that and I think uh the more people

380
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,719
are able to see all these different

381
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,198
perspectives um different ways of

382
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,120
thinking about how it's been used maybe

383
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,838
ways they've never even considered you

384
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,039
know I think that's really important to

385
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,199
talk

386
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:32,958
about yeah I think it's like I think

387
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:36,679
everyone you know we all kind of want

388
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,278
to uh kind of know what the roots of the

389
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:40,559
plant are and where it's come from and

390
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,240
things um but there's definitely been a

391
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,518
tendency in in sort of the WR on in in a

392
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,240
lot of the writing about it to to favor

393
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,360
this idea that it's

394
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,120
um to to favor aspects of it that fitted

395
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,360
with the sort of historical moment of

396
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,000
the 60s when it really became a mass

397
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,480
phenomenon in the west you know which

398
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,240
was yeah mostly sort of the anti-war

399
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,318
anti-racist um anti sort of

400
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,959
countercultural aspects that were

401
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,759
emphasized although things like you know

402
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,279
the assassins and stuff did kind of

403
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,558
creep in there because that was already

404
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:19,359
talked about quite a lot in sort of

405
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:21,879
Orient myths of or Legends or whatever

406
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:26,119
so you know that and that

407
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,439
does go into the Marshal context of use

408
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,599
and stuff as

409
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,440
well when when thing I thought we should

410
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,759
go over early on too because uh I mean

411
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,960
the nomenclature is important and and

412
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:40,879
even even this far in like I don't feel

413
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,120
confident anymore like trying to say

414
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,200
what I think a land race is versus an

415
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:49,079
heirloom versus you know anything else

416
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,759
um I'd love to have your your actual

417
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,399
working definitions of some of these

418
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,319
things as we talk about it so people

419
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,880
understand what we're talking about when

420
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:59,240
we say land race and heirloom varieties

421
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:02,280
yeah was a good idea yeah just yeah

422
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,319
[ __ ] mindfield of like different

423
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:07,119
terms so so I mean land race is just a

424
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:10,240
really unfortunate word from my

425
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:13,239
perspective that was a translation that

426
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,720
was made in the sort of late 19th early

427
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,599
late 19th century from various European

428
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,960
languages into English from German terms

429
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:25,480
Danish terms whatever like l in German

430
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,798
it would be land rer that was translated

431
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,558
into English as land race

432
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,319
um whereas actually if you were to do

433
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:36,079
that translation these days land race

434
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,639
would be best translated as country

435
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:42,279
breed or something like that

436
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,679
oh yeah so it's a

437
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,720
defunct form of the word race that we

438
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:51,080
just don't use anymore it's completely

439
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,120
archaic now in English but it was race

440
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:56,240
did once in English have the meaning of

441
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,000
breed as in a created something that

442
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
someone has breed has created like a

443
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,440
crop or a

444
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,880
a breed of animal you know so so so land

445
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,320
races are

446
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,679
uh artificially selected they're

447
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,079
Creations by humans for products that we

448
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,720
want they're created in certain areas by

449
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:18,399
Farmers so they they have an element of

450
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,759
region being region specific and cultur

451
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,159
but they're culture specific and they're

452
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:26,319
absolutely creatures of human desire and

453
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,679
whatever so they they're things that

454
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,879
farmers have created for certain

455
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,320
products so all land races are product

456
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,120
specific so the um tropical land races

457
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:39,960
are specific

458
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,479
for and we're talking drug quote you

459
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,840
know air quotes drug cannabis here so

460
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,759
tropical land races from places like

461
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:49,319
India southeast Asia are all

462
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,960
specifically

463
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:56,519
for uh cam semii as in ganja is the

464
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,200
traditional term for this like it's the

465
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:02,000
seedless inflorescences or or you know

466
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,720
very lightly seeded yeah it should be

467
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,038
like that and then that product goes

468
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,200
back to at least the 15th century

469
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,919
perhaps as early as the 12th century in

470
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,000
India you can find Sanskrit literature

471
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,720
that describes that technique of roguing

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,759
out the males cutting down the males how

473
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,240
to maximize resin production by certain

474
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,919
cultivation techniques and so on so

475
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,359
Jesus what we call sativas

476
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,600
are you know there're those are what we

477
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:33,959
call sativas so the tropical land races

478
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:38,359
fled um high THC because they've got

479
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,720
this uh long history of individual plant

480
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:44,119
selection

481
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,440
that's enabled by keeping the seed

482
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:49,439
from batch of good ganja you know

483
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,279
because yeah in

484
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,840
practice uh Farmers

485
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:59,038
don't you know you can find uh genuinely

486
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:01,599
100% C

487
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,119
it is still around even these days in in

488
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,879
places like India and la and Thailand

489
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:09,759
and stuff but for the most part you if

490
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,640
you buy a batch

491
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,960
of any significant size of ganja you

492
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,278
will find one or two seeds in there if

493
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,360
you're in India you know it's can be

494
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:24,519
loads of seeds often you know but

495
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,839
um it shouldn't be like that and

496
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,558
historically it wasn't like that for the

497
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:31,079
most part you know it's amazing that it

498
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:34,440
goes back that far I didn't know that

499
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:37,480
that it went back to the 12 with

500
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,720
selections yeah yeah so with with um

501
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,440
cutting down um yeah and you know so the

502
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,640
the point the point is that individual

503
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,360
plant selection is is a strong selected

504
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,799
pressure and that is enabled by that

505
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:53,759
strong selected pressure is enabled by

506
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:58,038
the fact that you do often

507
00:21:53,759 --> 00:22:00,079
find a seed or two in a batch of ganja

508
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,400
that you would buy you know abolutely so

509
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,359
consumers and officios and farmers are

510
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,759
all able to do that so consciously or

511
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,599
unconsciously you've got at least 500

512
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,919
years of individual plant selection

513
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,759
being a factor in the creation of

514
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,440
sativas which is why there's any kind of

515
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,879
fici knows they are the strongest forms

516
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,880
of land races

517
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,720
Thai Lao

518
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,360
burmes South Indian like

519
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,640
Kerala uh all these types of plants are

520
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:34,918
what went in to form the real kind of

521
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:38,080
original Haze yeah type sativas that

522
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:42,080
people know in the states and you know

523
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,720
back in the late 60s early 70s this was

524
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,399
literally

525
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,880
fetching multiples its weight in gold in

526
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,759
terms of price by the time it got from

527
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:56,480
from Thailand to the west coast of the

528
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,879
United States and it was the same in in

529
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,400
England so if you look at the custom

530
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,039
seizures records from the early ' 70s

531
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,640
for for for cannabis that was coming

532
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:08,400
from places like Ean in Thailand it was

533
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,038
like they were it was testing you know

534
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,519
with thin layer chromatography but which

535
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:14,759
is not hugely accurate but it was

536
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,960
testing kind of 177% THC yeah and that's

537
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:21,038
when they not gaming the tests and it's

538
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,880
probably sat in a warehouse in London or

539
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,038
for months never mind how long it took

540
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,840
to get to England in the first place you

541
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,278
know yeah so yeah I mean talking high

542
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,439
levels of potency so people aren't

543
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,278
making it up when they say that this

544
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,000
stuff could blow your head off you know

545
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:39,480
even in the 60s and 70s and doesn't you

546
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,119
don't need much more than 10% THC anyway

547
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,360
a lot of it's about the uh other stuff

548
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,399
that's in this in these uh the other

549
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,879
phyto chemicals that are in these plants

550
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,640
absolutely anyway to to stay focused so

551
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,840
there those are the sativas and then in

552
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:59,759
the north the main group is what people

553
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:02,678
call colloquially indicas which are the

554
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,200
you know I guess everyone knows what I'm

555
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,360
talking about broadly speaking but again

556
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,440
this is a type of land race that um you

557
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:14,399
know with the more semi- dwarf

558
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,278
morphology used for making hash so

559
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,480
product specific there's no culture of

560
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:24,000
CA in north of 30 degrees latitude so

561
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,558
once you've got to the north of Pakistan

562
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,398
there just is No in fact once you've

563
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:32,079
even got to the Punjab in India or the

564
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:36,398
Punjab in Pakistan it's bisected by

565
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:38,278
colonialism the um once you've got there

566
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:39,879
there's no culture of s by the time you

567
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:41,398
even get to the Punjab once you've gone

568
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,960
north of the Punjab towards the

569
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:46,119
foothills of the Hindu

570
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,360
Kush absolutely no sense culture at all

571
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:52,038
it's all hash and uh it's always been

572
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,839
that way so when you make hash you pull

573
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:58,679
the seeds yeah in the process of making

574
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:00,759
the hash so they just there not ever

575
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,798
been much in the way of any individual

576
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:05,398
plant selection on hash land Braes so

577
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:10,519
they bulk selected

578
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:14,158
crop that probably goes back Millennia

579
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:19,599
perhaps um that bulk selection which is

580
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:24,480
why on balance the the um the the

581
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:26,719
cannabinoid um uh characteristics of of

582
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,960
of of Inda land races do of lean

583
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,000
slightly towards THC dominant

584
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,240
um plants like type one plants as people

585
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,079
would call it but you do have in the

586
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,000
population a mix of type one type two

587
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:44,278
type three uh so you know High ratio of

588
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,359
THC to CBD is type one balanced THC and

589
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,679
CBD is type two and then type three is

590
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:53,000
sort of higher ratio of CBD to THC so

591
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,519
most hash land races will typically if

592
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,359
they're a pure land race we're talking

593
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,158
not a you know not Afghani number one or

594
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,678
something you can buy a

595
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,278
Dutch um seed bank um if they're a real

596
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:07,120
land race they tend to be like that they

597
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:08,798
do lean slightly towards type one

598
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,079
because they've had that history of bulk

599
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:14,960
selection it's you know more than random

600
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:18,759
more than random lean towards type one

601
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,278
but um uh yeah if you want to grow a

602
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:22,480
crop of Camila from from seed it's not

603
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:28,038
much

604
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:30,240
use uh to to to use a a real land race

605
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:33,038
you know they need to be worked to to

606
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,558
make them a cin cultiva you know so if

607
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,319
you were talking about the difference

608
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,398
between an heirloom and a land race

609
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,359
heirloom is not a technical term as far

610
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:44,319
as I know but it I would Define it in

611
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,678
the context of cannabis as uh a land

612
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,720
race that's been worked specifically for

613
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:53,720
in in a in a western or modern context

614
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:57,360
for since so x18 or deep chunk or

615
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,000
Afghani number one they're all in IND

616
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,158
indicia heirloom in a sense they're an

617
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,880
indicia land race that's been worked for

618
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,880
making sense yeah that's how Define it

619
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,799
that makes sense yeah

620
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,399
yeah and then you've got one other feral

621
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:14,639
varieties then like how how would you

622
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:17,119
define those in in terms of like land

623
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,840
race heirloom is it its own

624
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,439
type

625
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:23,079
um so

626
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,919
um

627
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:31,240
feral or kind of wild type is another

628
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,679
term you could use I think quite good um

629
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,159
they're

630
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,640
um you you don't find them much in the

631
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,200
tropics that as as a as a rule cannabis

632
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,519
doesn't

633
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,640
naturalize uh very well in the tropics

634
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:50,480
it's not uh a species that is well

635
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,159
adapted to that type of climate so if

636
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,679
you do find if you do find feral um

637
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,120
cannabis in the tropics it's because

638
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,640
you're you're you're at altitude

639
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,719
somewhere with a fairly

640
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,278
temperate

641
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,919
climate

642
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:07,359
um so for the most part if you if you're

643
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,759
in for example India you might find

644
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,479
weedy uh cannabis growing like anywhere

645
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,359
sort of north of the Ganges so we're

646
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,120
talking between in in in the sort of top

647
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,199
half of North India between the Ganges

648
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:19,839
and the Himalayas you know okay and then

649
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,720
as you go up towards the Himalayas

650
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,079
suddenly you'll find areas where it just

651
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,880
grows [ __ ] everywhere you

652
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,678
know just Seas of feral stuff especially

653
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,840
if you go up into Pakistan like Punjab

654
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,278
[ __ ]

655
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:36,398
everywhere um uh and then up into the

656
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:38,319
mountains around the rivers and

657
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,759
places anywhere where there's kind of

658
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,798
disturbed land but it's basically uh as

659
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:47,759
a species it's

660
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,200
uh it's a step species meaning it likes

661
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,599
kind of

662
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,120
windy um fairly dry places where there's

663
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:58,278
lots of disturbed land and uh to grow

664
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:00,199
along the sides of rivers where animals

665
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,640
to drink and [ __ ] and

666
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,480
stuff like high

667
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,480
nitrogen

668
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,720
uh decent amounts of water but not rainy

669
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,360
you know

670
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:19,480
um CBD dominant for stuff like

671
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:22,558
that um no um not necessarily so um

672
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,319
basically they're kind of um like nobody

673
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,519
knows where there's a pure nobody's ever

674
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,398
kind of satisfactory identified like a

675
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,399
pure wild like unaffected Ed by humans

676
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:33,558
pure wild cannabis plants has never been

677
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,439
found you know that makes sense so what

678
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:37,119
you actually have is like parallel

679
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,960
populations that have just been swapping

680
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,599
genes with whatever the local form of

681
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,000
cannabis is you know in the sense of

682
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:47,278
like humans domesticated at

683
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,359
least I don't know kind of say 8,000

684
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:53,079
years ago probably we started at least

685
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:55,959
you know unintentionally domesticating

686
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:58,798
cannabis yeah and um by just bringing it

687
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,440
back to hun gather like bringing it back

688
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,599
to places where they

689
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,640
were eating and stuff we like we're

690
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,480
unconsciously selecting for types that

691
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,320
we liked you know yeah and then quite

692
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,480
happy to grow around our campfires and

693
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:16,599
stuff because there was lots of [ __ ] and

694
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:21,640
discarded animal bones and stuff that

695
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:25,558
just are good for cannabis to so

696
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,600
um um basically if you're in somewhere

697
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:31,038
like the Punjab where it grows which is

698
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,158
north uh West

699
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:37,119
India where where where there's a lot of

700
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,640
wildr cannabis you can you can people do

701
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,319
like crop the

702
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,159
feral uh weedy stuff provided it's

703
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,678
somewhere clean that's not Dusty and

704
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,760
things you can just crop that and um use

705
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,759
it for making food and things you know

706
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:55,759
yeah so these are high high THC

707
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:58,599
um in in the sense of

708
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:01,158
uh they will get you stoned you it's

709
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:02,918
yeah it's not like in um places like I

710
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,320
don't know Wisconsin or somewhere in the

711
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:09,639
states where it's basically hemp that's

712
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:12,158
gone feral you know yeah the fiber h r

713
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:14,119
yeah I mean there are definitely like if

714
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,600
we're talking probably make things

715
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,558
confusing but anyway these are like in

716
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:20,278
in in in in those in all of sort of

717
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,720
Central and South South Asia where you

718
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:28,000
get feral populations it's pretty much

719
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,558
um drug drug type quotes cannabis yeah

720
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,159
and then in the Himalayas like uh people

721
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:37,158
do sometimes hand rub the the feral

722
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,278
populations for for Charis and it makes

723
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,399
what people sometimes call jungly Charis

724
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,880
as in like wild Charis but actually

725
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,199
there's a again this is one of those

726
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,559
kind of hippie Trail type

727
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,200
confusions there's been this assumption

728
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,480
that Himalayan cannabis is always feral

729
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,120
cannabis which is it which it isn't like

730
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,159
yeah

731
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:01,038
99% of the Charis that's produced in the

732
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,960
Himalayas every year is

733
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,278
From

734
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,079
domesticated intentionally

735
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:11,679
cultivated land races grown in fields by

736
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:15,119
a farmer you know yeah this that it's

737
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,600
the Himalayan cannabis is uh is all wild

738
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,479
and stuff is not not accurate like in

739
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,199
terms of the product is just very seldom

740
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,639
produced from the wild wedi stands you

741
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,960
can and people do but it's got way less

742
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:29,678
resin production than the the than the

743
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,558
actual land rces do you know

744
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,320
I'm yeah and and and it's useless for

745
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:37,960
making CSO it's not because it's all

746
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,960
going to be seeded anyway yeah you can't

747
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,440
use it for to smoke as bud it's just

748
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,798
it's I mean you do see sadu doing that I

749
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,639
have seen sadu like Yogi's wondering

750
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:50,319
kind of Yogi characters who've yeah gone

751
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:53,000
up to the Himalayas and picked picked a

752
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,119
whole load of feral

753
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
flowers and then they just sit and they

754
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,959
kind of pick out the seeds and mix it

755
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,480
with some tobacco and smoke it but it's

756
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,519
it's not like it's uh you know it's

757
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,558
not um designed for that yeah is why

758
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:09,960
people rub it for Chas because it it's

759
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:11,119
timec consuming to do but you end up

760
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,840
with a product that is actually going to

761
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,359
get you stoned yeah whereas smoking a

762
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,119
whole load of feral Bud like that mixed

763
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,678
with tobacco it's more just like a kind

764
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,638
of a maybe take the edge

765
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,880
off whatever physical discomfort you

766
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:26,719
experience as a as a wondering Yogi but

767
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,278
it's not going to like get you

768
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,600
particularly high I would thought unless

769
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:35,359
you really just happened to find an

770
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:37,879
unusually strong plant sure yeah you

771
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,398
know um one of the the interesting

772
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,559
things like from from the American

773
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:46,439
perspective at least for mine um is

774
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:49,200
trying like in my mind to Divi Define

775
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,080
Expressions between uh when people talk

776
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,278
about indicia types specifically or the

777
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:59,158
the broadleaf types um the differences

778
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:03,880
between like an Afghan type plant and a

779
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:07,639
Pakistani plant where the the overlap is

780
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:11,960
and you know like there's always talk of

781
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:14,398
Chinese um broadleaf types and I I've

782
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,960
never got my hands on any of those I

783
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,480
remember someone made the unan available

784
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,320
for a while but I never got to grow any

785
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,199
um I'd like to hear some of your Insight

786
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,440
on that and the the major differences

787
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,960
and I know it's kind of hard to

788
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,878
generally speak on expressions from

789
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,559
Whole regions you know depending on the

790
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:33,878
elevation but is there anything that

791
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,719
you've noticed between um say

792
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:41,199
Afghanistan and Pakistan in and how they

793
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:44,398
grow um scent Expressions anything like

794
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:47,199
that I mean it's it's particularly

795
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,799
difficult with um those Northern type

796
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,960
Central Asian you know Afghan Pakistani

797
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,399
yeah

798
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,320
uh populations because what you get if

799
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,679
you grow like a first generation of

800
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,400
direct from those places like seeds

801
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,919
directly from a farmer in Pakistan or

802
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,920
Afghanistan whatever there's a huge

803
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,400
amount of variation within the

804
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,159
population of one batch of seeds from

805
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,680
one farmer so the range of Aromas that

806
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,960
you're going to find in one field from

807
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,039
plant to plant just in one of those land

808
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,039
races it's extraordinarily diverse you

809
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,960
know one plant might be really kind of

810
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:27,000
like kind of candy shot sweet Tangy

811
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,440
Aromas the next one might smell like a

812
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,800
dog [ __ ]

813
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,519
yeah

814
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,359
whatever and and and so it's

815
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,719
particularly in those Northern

816
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,480
populations there's because they're bulk

817
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,159
selected they're not as genetically

818
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:45,719
narrow as tropical sativa populations

819
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:48,159
are so because they they haven't had

820
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:50,480
they haven't you know the the genome

821
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,879
hasn't been Stepped On by Farmers doing

822
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,318
much in the way of very consciously

823
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,720
intentionally directed

824
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:00,400
breeding there's a huge amount of

825
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:03,318
variation anyway and

826
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,440
then on top of that in terms of the

827
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:08,960
difficulty of generalizing you know

828
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,880
because the the Assumption amongst

829
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:16,039
afficianados is that Precision more

830
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,559
Precision in in your description means

831
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:21,400
more accuracy but actually if you get if

832
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,599
you get too precise on these things you

833
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,480
become less accurate you know yeah for

834
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,960
sure there's vast amounts of diversity

835
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,599
so particularly with cannabis because

836
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,240
it's so

837
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,400
phenotypically plastic so it because

838
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:40,679
like I was saying it's a

839
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:44,920
mountain uh species that's evolved um at

840
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:47,000
altitude um to adapt to the huge climate

841
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,960
shifts you get at altitude and that kind

842
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,199
of thing it can express itself very

843
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,079
differently depending on where it's

844
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:58,159
planted so if you were to plant the same

845
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,920
land race at sea level and then plant at

846
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,799
3 and half th000

847
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,358
M exactly the same batch of seeds from

848
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,000
the same

849
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:09,598
farmer uh you will see very different

850
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
plant looking plants morphologically

851
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,240
because you plant them up higher

852
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,559
altitude they're going to grow much

853
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:18,039
shorter broad more Broad Leaf they're

854
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:19,960
going to pump out way more resin yeah

855
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:22,039
probably going to have different

856
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,880
phytochemicals probably smell different

857
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,880
and everything you know so yeah and

858
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,200
likewise if you you can get that even

859
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,240
with tropical sativas if you grow them

860
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,078
on well they're going to be amazing if

861
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,399
you grow them incompetently they're not

862
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,519
going to smell so good you know yeah you

863
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,440
kind of have to go to point of origin to

864
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:43,960
to experience them as they

865
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,440
are uh yeah I mean it definitely makes a

866
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,880
vast difference even with the more

867
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,240
genetically narrow populations like

868
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,400
tropical steers if they're grown well by

869
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,519
someone who knows how to do it on the

870
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,200
right type of land with the right

871
00:37:54,519 --> 00:38:03,039
irrigation timing the right Fe in timing

872
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:05,519
the right uh you know everything if you

873
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,639
overwater a tropical sativa late in flow

874
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:09,440
it's going to keep growing keep putting

875
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:12,799
out Buds and leaflets and it's going to

876
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,000
be [ __ ] yeah and no one and this is why

877
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,880
you get all this bollocks talk about 30

878
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,880
weeks ofas indoors and stuff it's just

879
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,119
people just [ __ ] watering it you know

880
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,119
so

881
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,879
stoper but anyway you know and if you

882
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:29,679
look at the Historical records it's

883
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,880
always it will tell you this like uh in

884
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:36,078
the um 19th century documentation of of

885
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,400
the ganja farms in Bengal and places

886
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,200
it's like yeah Farmers always say worst

887
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,039
thing that can happen is we get rains in

888
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:43,318
like January February and it'll [ __ ] up

889
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,358
our whole crop because it will start

890
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:50,119
shooting again yada yada yada yeah

891
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:52,358
anyway so it's all it's all there if you

892
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,079
if you want to look and stuff and I have

893
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:55,759
blogged about this on on the site as

894
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,318
well if people are wanting to go into

895
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,680
more depth and you can find all the

896
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:04,039
sources and stuff but um it's an amazing

897
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,199
blog by the way like it's I've learned a

898
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,279
lot reading through it over the years oh

899
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:12,279
that's good to know I I'm glad someone

900
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,480
reads it yeah I do I mean it's it's how

901
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,519
I how I um like came to know you without

902
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,199
speaking to you a bunch was through the

903
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:23,000
blog and seeing the passion and how you

904
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:25,078
write and how in-depth the detail was

905
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,920
and and over time learning how accurate

906
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,960
it was which is the most important you

907
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,318
know yeah well it's good to hear man

908
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,880
thanks I appreciate it I I've shifted

909
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,559
most of it now to the actual main

910
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,559
website blog rather than the sort of um

911
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:39,199
independent blog because uh it just

912
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:40,719
seems to make more sense so generally

913
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,358
I've been kind of moving everything over

914
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:46,039
to the main blog on the site now just

915
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,759
because uh it seems to make more sense

916
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:50,679
but I before I lose the thread of what

917
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,880
you were originally asking um so in

918
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:56,838
terms of Pakistan versus Afghanistan so

919
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,599
the thing to bear in mind is like um

920
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:00,559
seeds move around a lot seeds move

921
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,720
around with people in areas where people

922
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:07,318
use them as as a food and not just for

923
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:10,838
growing as well yeah plus

924
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:13,599
um uh you know these are artificial

925
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:17,480
political boundaries so there's no

926
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,599
cultural real boundary if in in in

927
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,079
meaningful terms cannabis wise between

928
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:24,800
uh the Hindu Kush in Pakistan and the

929
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,200
Hindu Kush in Afghanistan you know so I

930
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,720
want to try to kind of avoid being sort

931
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,759
of a [ __ ] as far as possible but

932
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,039
there's all this stuff I see on

933
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,599
Instagram with people talking about the

934
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,960
Duren line and stuff and like the dur

935
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,480
line there this it's just just [ __ ]

936
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,280
that's bizarre to me as well because I

937
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,559
think most of the kids who are doing

938
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,599
this are like Asian as well so it's like

939
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,880
the DAR line was just Dar was just some

940
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,920
[ __ ] from the UK who drew a pencil line

941
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,838
across the boundary between Pakistan and

942
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,559
Afghanistan you know the [ __ ] has that

943
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:58,000
got to do with anything you know

944
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,759
and and and

945
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,639
it's only in the last kind of 10 years

946
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,720
that um uh they've actually really

947
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:07,519
started policing that border and putting

948
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:09,000
fences up and things and even then it

949
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,400
doesn't make the blindest [ __ ] bit of

950
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,480
difference anyone who really wants to

951
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,960
get things across it can still do it but

952
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,960
in cannabis terms it's just [ __ ]

953
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,880
meaningless I mean and and and seeds

954
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,880
have been you know uh seeds have been

955
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,480
moved from Afghanistan down to places

956
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,400
like tra Valley in Pakistan you know

957
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,920
there's there's plenty of local stories

958
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,440
about the various kind of dervish like

959
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,079
kander Sufi type Saint characters who

960
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,599
are s of credited with bringing seeds

961
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,400
into TR and things and and and um which

962
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,559
T is one of the big cultivation valleys

963
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,200
in Pakistan and yeah this this whole

964
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:45,799
area is is seamless seamless with it's

965
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:48,078
the whole reason the politics and the

966
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,599
history is the way it is is because it's

967
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,079
impossible to police these mountain

968
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,720
borders you know oh I'm sure huge

969
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,440
smuggling between these places and then

970
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:00,039
uh chitra is another one of the famous

971
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,480
areas like yakun Valley and things up in

972
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,239
the Hindu Kush these all lead into

973
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,440
shinjang these are the trade routes that

974
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,318
you would take from shinjang which is

975
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,800
the Eastern Central Asian area that's

976
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:14,279
turkic area of of politically it's

977
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,599
inside what's now China and this was a

978
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,440
the biggest hash producing uh region in

979
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,960
in the world for oh wow for centuries oh

980
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,480
absolutely I mean this was the epicenter

981
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,159
of hash production so it wasn't

982
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,960
Afghanistan or Pakistan it was shinjang

983
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:31,838
was until the

984
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:34,000
19 late 1930s was the absolute [ __ ]

985
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,920
epicenter of world hash production I

986
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,079
mean thousands and thousands of tons of

987
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,039
hash were being moved from these places

988
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:44,000
across the mountain passes into the into

989
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:46,558
India because all the money was in

990
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,119
Northern India yeah and the demand for

991
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,240
these products was in Northern India in

992
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,519
these huge cities which even in the late

993
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,959
19th century places like laor and Delhi

994
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:57,800
had millions of well laor certainly had

995
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,480
in is the big Punjabi City had you know

996
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,800
seven eight nine 10 million people or

997
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,880
whatever even in the

998
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,160
1860s so these

999
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,800
were massively massive senses of demand

1000
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:12,480
for these products and so they the the

1001
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,800
production was all happening in eastern

1002
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,440
central Asia so in shinjang and um you

1003
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,519
know the British were trying to make

1004
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,960
sure as much of what came into India was

1005
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:25,000
being taxed effectively they didn't want

1006
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,519
too much smuggling and um you know seeds

1007
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,920
were moving around between these places

1008
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:32,920
you can read about the people who were

1009
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,240
responsible for uh a lot of the uh

1010
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,559
initiation of like commercial production

1011
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:42,719
in in um in shinjang for India were

1012
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:44,559
often Indians or uh ethnically from

1013
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,279
ethnic groups of of the mountains of

1014
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,839
Pakistan you know

1015
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:54,599
so there there's just not

1016
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:56,039
um um much basis for assuming that

1017
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,240
there's going to be

1018
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:59,960
a you know there's there's a very

1019
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,759
nuanced picture if you're talking about

1020
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,760
the diff how how these land races in

1021
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,160
these regions are differentiated from

1022
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,880
each other yeah once you get into

1023
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,759
Pakistan in the northern mountains there

1024
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,440
probably is a certain degree of mixing

1025
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,359
between kind of the more sativa type

1026
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,000
um the further south you move away from

1027
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:19,519
the southern edges of Central Asia the

1028
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,480
further south you get away from the

1029
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,119
Hindu

1030
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,838
Kush there probably is

1031
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,559
more prep there is a a higher likelihood

1032
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:32,719
that you're going to have a degree of

1033
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:37,160
intermixing with more Monson type

1034
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:39,719
tropical type Punjabi type

1035
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:42,440
populations uh so you know more

1036
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,959
hybridization between sativa type

1037
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,440
populations and indicia type populations

1038
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,480
the further north you go

1039
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,679
into I don't know into places like

1040
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,800
shinjang there's a higher likelihood I

1041
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,039
guess of it being a a sort of quotes

1042
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,119
pure indicia type you know so if you

1043
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:01,400
look at the plant that were brought back

1044
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,680
from Shin Jang in the early 20th century

1045
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:07,960
by people like Frank Meyer and stuff for

1046
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:13,000
the USDA they definitely are very Inda

1047
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,838
looking um plants and um uh yeah I mean

1048
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,679
you know um you had some of those

1049
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:19,880
pictures on your blog too correct yeah

1050
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:23,558
yeah so yeah and and

1051
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,559
um uh you know

1052
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,000
they're there's no question that there

1053
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:30,559
are these distinct types you know the

1054
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,880
confusion of the confusion with the

1055
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,040
discussion about are there such things

1056
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,559
as indicas and sativas is

1057
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,838
like yes there definitely are in terms

1058
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:41,200
of if you're looking at pure land races

1059
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,039
yeah real land

1060
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,879
races um there are these clearly

1061
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:49,199
distinct types there's also of course

1062
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,160
some integrating between them even in

1063
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:55,199
pure land races some some Landes are

1064
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:58,440
likely to have Arisen through mixing of

1065
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,799
these types uh but of course once you

1066
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,679
move into the context of what you're

1067
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,359
going to find at most dispensaries or

1068
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:08,199
seed banks uh like cannabis

1069
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,719
internet seat banks that is yeah most of

1070
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,759
what you're going to find is is a

1071
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:15,078
indicator sativa hybrid so this

1072
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,400
terminology becomes meaningless in in

1073
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:20,079
often most of the time in those contexts

1074
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,079
you know

1075
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:27,760
yeah important Point too like especially

1076
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:29,039
uh from people that in in the US that

1077
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,920
can go to collectives and stuff and

1078
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,960
they're seeing indicia hybrid sativa and

1079
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,559
they feel like they have a pretty good

1080
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,760
working knowledge of what what each is

1081
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,599
and um quite often I mean I don't really

1082
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:45,720
see anything too narrow Leaf anywhere

1083
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,079
you know or no not at all it's problem

1084
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,679
because

1085
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,318
um

1086
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:53,838
um that's how cannabis goes extinct you

1087
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:55,679
know biodiversity and cannabis primarily

1088
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,639
disappears through hybridization you

1089
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,759
know yeah so

1090
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:03,639
uh this impulse that most people have to

1091
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,160
like hybridize everything when they

1092
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:08,039
because it is fun you know it's like see

1093
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,759
what happens yeah actually the most

1094
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:13,079
exciting thing you can do really these

1095
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,040
days especially is to actually keep some

1096
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,720
pristine lines going that you haven't

1097
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:21,318
outcrossed because that's the

1098
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:23,639
basis of uh everything really and once

1099
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:25,759
we've got to a point where all we've got

1100
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:27,558
a hybridized lines then it becomes

1101
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,800
impossible to to do breeding that

1102
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:34,559
doesn't have become impossible but you

1103
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:36,920
can't make true F1 cult our yeah what

1104
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:41,440
have you noticed or maybe haven't

1105
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,680
noticed or uh as far as in those uh

1106
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,800
regions of like Afghanistan and Pakistan

1107
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,759
I've noticed there's a lot of people

1108
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,559
popping up especially on Instagram as

1109
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:52,920
Instagram became bigger especially for

1110
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:55,200
cannabis and and seeds um yeah have you

1111
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,599
noticed a lot more hybridization

1112
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:00,279
involved like with modern lines T kind

1113
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:04,160
of working their way into these lines

1114
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,880
that are being declared Pure or you know

1115
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,318
have you

1116
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,000
noticed sort of

1117
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:14,440
don't

1118
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,719
um I generally try and like just ignore

1119
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,519
most of the the sort of people doing

1120
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:22,959
those things um but every every couple

1121
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:24,719
of years I sort of maybe get curious

1122
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,838
about what they might be saying and it's

1123
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:31,000
always I mean the thing is I don't like

1124
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:33,960
U I don't really know what they're up to

1125
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
uh for the most part um it worries me

1126
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:40,159
because I suspect most of them based on

1127
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,318
what I heard um have been involved in

1128
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:44,558
also bringing hybrid seed over to places

1129
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,960
as well you know yep yeah I can't

1130
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,760
substantiate that Beyond some Forum

1131
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,880
things I saw in like 2018 when there was

1132
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,880
suddenly there was a 2018 as there was

1133
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:58,640
this sort of big yes realization among

1134
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:01,880
some of these characters that um oh we

1135
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,400
can get seeds from these places but at

1136
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,000
the same time they were sort of wanting

1137
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,880
to there was certainly some of them were

1138
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,318
wanting to bring seeds up to places like

1139
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,920
Parvati and Milana the sort of typical

1140
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:15,079
Himalayan areas for for for for Charis

1141
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,519
in India and

1142
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:20,039
um yeah and then I saw these ridiculous

1143
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:25,358
kind of excuses being made oh there's

1144
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:27,358
some kind of wind wind uh climate type

1145
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,159
micro climate to do with WIS that means

1146
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:33,119
that any pollen from hybrids that we

1147
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:33,118
bring up to Milano is is not going

1148
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:40,078
to [ __ ] you can imagine and and it just

1149
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,679
just after that I just I think I wrote a

1150
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,680
kind of couple of sort of irritated

1151
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:46,679
things back then on on the on the on

1152
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,798
that old blog and about the amount of

1153
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,118
[ __ ] that's spouted and and then

1154
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:52,960
just thought [ __ ] it this is gonna put

1155
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:55,200
me in a bad mood so I I I don't like

1156
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,639
going on social media anyway much it

1157
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,639
tends to put me in a negative

1158
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:04,759
so I I just have chosen to ignore it and

1159
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,880
do do my own thing really so I can't

1160
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,359
give anyone an informed opinion about

1161
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:13,480
what exactly is going on up to a point I

1162
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:15,920
know certain outfits have like stolen

1163
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,760
stuff from people who Supply me as in as

1164
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,838
in like yeah they've supplied like I

1165
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,200
know I know one outfit that one of the

1166
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:24,880
guys who supplies me has sent seeds to

1167
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,199
then they didn't pay him and they just

1168
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,480
knocked off his strain and sold the

1169
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,519
seeds and kept the money for themselves

1170
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,639
yeah um so I know there's outfits that

1171
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:37,079
are that shitty but that's that's like I

1172
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:40,118
can only

1173
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,920
um I only know that because it's in

1174
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,519
intruded on my world as it were I

1175
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,000
haven't proactively seeking out

1176
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:49,480
knowledge of what they get up to because

1177
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,880
it's just it's not it's not conducive to

1178
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:56,719
being in a in a positive State of Mind

1179
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:58,640
to involve yourself with [ __ ] but um

1180
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,919
no I mean I mean to go back to the

1181
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,279
plants and stuff like

1182
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,639
um one thing I think is probably worth

1183
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,920
clarifying for

1184
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:11,639
people um Himalayan uh land races as in

1185
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:16,639
we're talking between sort of you know

1186
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:20,199
Napal and Kashmir are a distinct group

1187
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:22,960
themselves right they're not indicas

1188
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:25,399
they're not true tropical sativas

1189
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,599
they're another kind of group within

1190
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:31,318
land races that's very clearly distinct

1191
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:34,559
you know they're much taller plants they

1192
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:37,079
generally are triple use multi-purpose

1193
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,040
plants so they're for seeds for fiber

1194
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:39,680
and

1195
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:44,239
for

1196
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:46,919
um hashes Chas uh they're not um you

1197
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:50,118
know they have a the canabo profile is

1198
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,000
typically like a Central Asian you know

1199
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:53,680
a field of them will break down into

1200
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,719
like type one type two and type three

1201
00:51:53,679 --> 00:52:00,000
cannaboid profiles chemotypes

1202
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:02,838
so they're a very distinct group and the

1203
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,599
problem with people bringing Dutch

1204
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:10,279
and um genetics up to Milan and stuff is

1205
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,480
you can see it's just uh that around

1206
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,400
that

1207
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:18,000
area is very obviously not the same as

1208
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,720
it was even when I first went there you

1209
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:26,679
know yeah

1210
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:30,838
it's uh very clear that there's

1211
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:33,078
that skunky Dutch kind of effect as not

1212
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:39,078
just not just a smell the sort of effect

1213
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:41,559
it's yeah um uh I was I was there um one

1214
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:43,720
time when this uh real kind of crazy

1215
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,480
oldtime guy turned up who bought a bunch

1216
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:49,798
of like tie brick weed with him in his

1217
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:54,280
from from flown from Bangkok

1218
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:57,920
to India like oh my goodness couple of

1219
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,680
hundred gram like brick of

1220
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,400
weird from like coang or somewhere Kang

1221
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:05,118
and just a maniac you know but anyway he

1222
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:08,039
had a bunch of it with him in this guest

1223
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,280
house and it was very interesting like

1224
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:14,480
smoking some of

1225
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:16,400
that side by side with the the a lot of

1226
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,599
what you could find in in manik Kuran

1227
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,160
and places at that point yeah and this

1228
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:24,559
is was at least 10 years ago and you

1229
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,679
know the effect of the the stuff from

1230
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,079
around that end of Parvati there had

1231
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:30,598
been so much Dutch stuff brought in by

1232
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:34,599
that point the smell of it was like that

1233
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:39,240
real kind of skunky pissy Ur urinal

1234
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:41,359
Aroma and then it was a very unup foric

1235
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:44,798
Buzz compared to what I associate with

1236
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:47,239
that area and then you smoked the Thai

1237
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:50,519
stuff and it was really kind of up and

1238
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:52,959
zingy and then the you

1239
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:56,880
know yeah it's just really stood out

1240
00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:00,199
like similarly if you if you go to areas

1241
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,200
of the Himalayas that haven't had that

1242
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:05,798
um uh introduction of foreign hybrid

1243
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:08,078
seed the effect is of the Charis in the

1244
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:10,358
sort of unfashionable bits of the

1245
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,200
Himalayas to go to is is the old school

1246
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:16,519
real stuff that's not been obviously

1247
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:18,598
[ __ ] up the effect of it is much nicer

1248
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:20,480
you know it's like yeah much more

1249
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:24,160
uplifting and

1250
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,559
positive uh feeling you know it's uh

1251
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:27,838
there's there's rarely something with

1252
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:30,880
skunk one in it that I can smoke because

1253
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:33,960
it always takes me to a very specific

1254
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,680
like negative space in my head so

1255
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,358
usually I can pick it out it's taking a

1256
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:40,078
long time but I can pretty much like

1257
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,880
yeah pick out anything that has skunk

1258
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,400
one in it there's very few exceptions

1259
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,318
that I find something I love you know

1260
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:51,079
that has that in it at least you know

1261
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:53,639
50% yeah and a lot of the anyway

1262
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,240
the the the the the most of the

1263
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:58,480
continuations of it have been selected

1264
00:54:55,239 --> 00:55:02,598
for the sort of heavy side of it as well

1265
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,079
so yes it's uh most mostly in the UK if

1266
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:06,680
if if you get something skunky it's

1267
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:10,280
anywhere it's going to be like a Hindu

1268
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:12,838
kusun Afghan skun whatever yeah anyway

1269
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,880
so it's doubly like leaning that way

1270
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:16,440
anyway but the thing the thing to bear

1271
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,920
in mind as well is that like that's not

1272
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,599
anyway the if you look in Afghan land

1273
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,079
races themselves Hindu Kush land races

1274
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:23,519
whatever that whole Zone they're not

1275
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,440
necessarily like that they're not

1276
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:28,119
necessarily sedative like some of them

1277
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:32,960
clearly are predominantly like that but

1278
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:36,200
there's such a wide uh range of uh

1279
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:39,599
phytochemical you know CH type whatever

1280
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:42,159
that in these populations that aren't

1281
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,880
going to give you that type of uh effect

1282
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:48,078
as well so there's no we're not kind of

1283
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:51,318
stuck with this as long as we can keep

1284
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:55,880
the some good representations of like

1285
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:57,558
pristine uh uh land races in storage you

1286
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,480
know they will always be the possibility

1287
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:03,240
of creating new things that that

1288
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,480
actually feel good which is you know

1289
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:06,239
gets back to your original question of

1290
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,960
like why did I get into this and like a

1291
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:13,679
lot of people um the sort of standard

1292
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:16,039
narrative is that you know in the UK the

1293
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:18,318
standard narrative is oh around around

1294
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:21,039
the year 2000 suddenly all this hybrid

1295
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:23,079
stuff arrived and it was just too strong

1296
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,359
and it's like not really I wouldn't say

1297
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:26,440
it was too strong was the issue the

1298
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:29,119
effect was just it wasn't very [ __ ]

1299
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,440
nice you know a lot of it so a lot of

1300
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,720
people didn't stop smoking because it

1301
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,920
was too strong so much as it was just a

1302
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:37,759
dysphoric effect from so much of it

1303
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,318
compared to what they were used to from

1304
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,319
the the traditional stuff you know yeah

1305
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,759
so mostly what people people say oh yeah

1306
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:46,519
it used to make me paranoid and stuff

1307
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,520
and it's like the assumption is that

1308
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:51,280
that's um because it's just too strong

1309
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:55,480
but it's not necessarily that you can

1310
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,960
have very strong tropical sativas that

1311
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,358
um

1312
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,519
primarily don't make you feel

1313
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:05,798
particularly paranoid you know yeah by

1314
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:07,079
absolutely yeah yeah that's a good point

1315
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:09,239
yeah

1316
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,760
um I don't think that's widely talked

1317
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:15,239
about either that's a no it's

1318
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,880
just it was it's it's just too strong

1319
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:18,598
that's why I don't smoke it's like well

1320
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,880
actually you can have a plenty of you

1321
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:24,039
know

1322
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:26,838
strong uh highs of cannabis that are

1323
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:28,920
uh are really nice you know yeah they

1324
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:31,920
don't evoke the paranoia and all that

1325
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,920
other [ __ ] General kind of grebby dirty

1326
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,280
feeling that you kind of yeah but I mean

1327
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,119
it's not you know again I I'm always

1328
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,599
very wary of talking myself into a

1329
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,318
corner of being kind of anti-modern

1330
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:45,160
stuff which I'm not at all I

1331
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:49,838
just I I'm I'm just Pro kind of pro

1332
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:52,838
diversity Pro um possibility which is

1333
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,880
why I why I think it's worth preserving

1334
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:56,759
as much as we can of what there is left

1335
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,200
of of these

1336
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,799
think so that there is that option in

1337
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:04,798
the future of taking the plant down

1338
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:06,960
different routes there's this this a

1339
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:09,000
sort of default assumption that we've

1340
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,838
already arrived at the Pinnacle of what

1341
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,519
can be achieved in cannabis that was so

1342
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:16,239
much a part of the last 10 years of

1343
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:18,798
cannabis discourse this assumption it's

1344
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:21,529
like yeah you know these Elite cuts and

1345
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,759
stuff are like the best it's like

1346
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:27,119
[Music]

1347
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:29,920
no sure but sure as [ __ ] on like the all

1348
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,440
there is to be to be achieved you know

1349
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,680
yeah I try to explain to people a lot of

1350
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,920
the quote unquote Elite Cuts in the US

1351
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:37,399
like most of those were picked out of

1352
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,838
two three seeds you know like in

1353
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:43,920
someone's closet like in it's not I mean

1354
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:46,519
Elites definitely uh it's very rare that

1355
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,559
I find any of those old clones that have

1356
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:50,199
been passed around that everyone

1357
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:53,079
universally agrees that's [ __ ]

1358
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:56,159
amazing it's so rare to ever find that

1359
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:58,160
you know there's very few so yeah I the

1360
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:00,440
clone Market in the US has been

1361
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:03,798
completely taking over lately with that

1362
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,720
spreading of hlv so a lot of like the

1363
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:07,358
past few seasons of what I've been doing

1364
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:10,038
is trying to explain to people the

1365
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:12,558
necessity of seeds versus clones as well

1366
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:16,400
in the US and I know that a bunch of the

1367
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:18,640
Spanish SE or Spanish clones or stuff

1368
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,280
from here that went over there has

1369
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,798
murdered some of the libraries over

1370
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:24,200
there of some of the Old Dutch stuff

1371
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:27,880
that they had been keeping um right it's

1372
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:29,798
not SL down it's not down anytime soon

1373
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,599
and so that's very interesting I didn't

1374
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:34,559
I wasn't aware that that this is the hot

1375
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:37,960
lat thyroid yes so it's just basically

1376
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,559
[ __ ] everything up oh already scenario

1377
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,559
where we're paying the price of how

1378
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:43,519
[ __ ]

1379
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,480
homogeneous all of our stuff is already

1380
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,759
yeah [ __ ] man

1381
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,039
yeah about it but I hadn't realized it

1382
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,839
it actually got to the point of like

1383
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:54,839
trashing people's collections as well oh

1384
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:57,199
yeah um with one of the bigger clone

1385
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:59,759
nurseries that I know of and they'll

1386
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:02,480
remain nameless but um they are pretty

1387
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,559
content with 3% of clones going out with

1388
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:08,358
hlv because it's so

1389
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:11,400
inundated right just it's assumed that

1390
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:14,159
3% is is the best that they can do not

1391
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,440
0% but 3% is like when you are

1392
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,000
constantly testing constantly because

1393
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,679
they're still bringing stuff in because

1394
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,280
everybody wants this cookies renamed

1395
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:25,118
whatever the new name for cookie stuff

1396
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,640
is today you know and and it's still

1397
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,358
working on people obviously um the

1398
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:32,558
education is out there but it's it's not

1399
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:34,519
being accessed or maybe you know there

1400
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,440
is a big difference between smokers and

1401
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:39,400
Growers there's there's a wide pool that

1402
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,720
just it's really hard to get through

1403
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,720
because most people that I've

1404
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:46,558
encountered here the attitude is why do

1405
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,558
you care so much it's just weed you

1406
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:53,960
know that's like a very standard British

1407
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,680
attitude it's like it's all just weed

1408
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,798
yeah it's like yeah

1409
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:02,598
yeah like um Americans coming over to

1410
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:03,798
the UK are just like H you know when

1411
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:07,280
they see

1412
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:10,239
what's available to someone who is just

1413
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,880
uh randomly turning up in England it's

1414
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:15,000
it's dismal you know even these days

1415
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,280
unless you grow for yourself and or you

1416
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,639
happen to be in a city that's

1417
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,960
particularly like weed orientated it's

1418
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:24,759
very very dismal you know but yeah I

1419
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,199
mean I that's that's this this is what

1420
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,640
I've always had in mind is that you know

1421
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:32,318
there there is going to come a point and

1422
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:35,480
I had run across the hlv issue but it's

1423
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:37,239
not something that impacts me directly

1424
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:40,159
with the way I'm operating so I haven't

1425
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:41,239
been looking into it but I there always

1426
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,639
just going to come a point where

1427
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,159
something's going to come along that's

1428
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:47,679
just going to [ __ ]

1429
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:49,358
decimate um the the situation and people

1430
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:51,960
are going to realize just how [ __ ]

1431
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:55,920
homogeneous everything is and and yes

1432
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:59,559
it's so based on such a small handful of

1433
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,960
for the most part um you know uh Dutch

1434
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:03,278
and

1435
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,639
American lines you know this you could

1436
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:11,480
probably count them on two hands I

1437
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:14,239
expect the main contributors to the and

1438
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:17,079
um and and and people

1439
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:19,159
don't people especially sort of below

1440
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:21,318
Generation X don't really have any sense

1441
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:23,480
of that I think unless they're nerds you

1442
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:26,639
know yeah they had deep

1443
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,278
nerds yeah unless you grew up in the

1444
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,278
sort of preh

1445
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:33,880
hybrid era or happen to be interested in

1446
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:35,719
the actual growing side of it there's no

1447
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,599
reason why you necessarily realize you

1448
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:43,959
know yeah it's one of the problems as

1449
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:46,559
well um with the groups who are doing

1450
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:50,639
collecting is a lot of them I can tell

1451
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:53,359
are not from an age uh from a generation

1452
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:58,000
where they're necessarily even going to

1453
01:02:53,358 --> 01:03:00,558
know what a pure land race looks like in

1454
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,880
Thailand or Cambodia or whatever yeah

1455
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,440
you know something that to me would be

1456
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,240
so obvious that it's been hit with

1457
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,679
something Dutch or American that

1458
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,278
genuinely might not even realize how

1459
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:12,118
that it I've had people contact me

1460
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:13,760
saying hey I'm in you know cambod or

1461
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:15,720
whatever I found these great plants and

1462
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,720
it's like yeah they do look like pretty

1463
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:19,000
cool plants but I can tell from just a

1464
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:23,399
photo

1465
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:26,920
that they're not um lacking in the

1466
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,960
Afghan yeah for sure and uh people just

1467
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:31,119
don't realize you know they're still

1468
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,480
they're still worth collecting so it's

1469
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,278
but it does it does matter the

1470
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,679
difference between them and a

1471
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:41,798
pristine population does matter you know

1472
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:43,399
yeah um there's no reason like why they

1473
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:45,400
that they're not like bad per se it's

1474
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,838
just that they they are

1475
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:51,278
introgressed they're they're down the

1476
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:53,960
route of total homogenization they're

1477
01:03:51,278 --> 01:03:56,719
well down that route already and they're

1478
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,679
not not even half as valuable as the

1479
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:03,598
real thing you know

1480
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:05,798
absolutely yeah that's well put yeah so

1481
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:09,519
you have a lot of experience with

1482
01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:12,159
u maybe Southeast Asian is correct with

1483
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:13,480
h tyan La I've I've heard you know some

1484
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,278
of the stories

1485
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:19,278
that uh it was leosan Farmers bringing

1486
01:04:16,278 --> 01:04:21,798
down stuff to Thailand is um is there

1487
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:27,480
any veracity to that

1488
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:30,358
or um it's more the um

1489
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,079
the um I mean the the thing to bear in

1490
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:35,278
mind is again like it's a really

1491
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,480
important like really worth um bearing

1492
01:04:35,278 --> 01:04:41,679
in mind is that these political

1493
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:43,199
boundaries yeah uh a very modern

1494
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:46,838
Creations for the most part that don't

1495
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,838
have any real seen in terms

1496
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:55,439
of and the culture of the plant

1497
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:57,680
so any way if you picture the if you

1498
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:01,599
pict had the the meon kind of running

1499
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:03,879
from up in of the east of Tibet down

1500
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,480
into southeast Asia from you know

1501
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,640
through the Golden Triangle and down

1502
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:10,000
through Thailand and now down towards

1503
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:12,440
Cambodia all along the Mong either side

1504
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
of the Mong is is basically ethnic Lao

1505
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,278
anyway once you get into Thailand and

1506
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,838
and Lao

1507
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:22,079
so uh large chunks of thailander like

1508
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:25,239
isan where which is the famous the

1509
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:28,160
famous ttic areas of of Thailand all

1510
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:29,439
ethnic L anyway so it wasn't really a

1511
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:31,038
question of people bringing seeds I

1512
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,838
don't think it's just that the

1513
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,680
culture um

1514
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:38,920
existed yeah and um if you look at the

1515
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:42,919
early historical uh

1516
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:46,798
writing in so far as there is any in um

1517
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:48,680
Thailand about

1518
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:51,960
cannabis um I think there some from the

1519
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:53,838
sort of 18th century or 19th I think

1520
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,760
more 19th century some of the earliest

1521
01:05:53,838 --> 01:06:00,078
references that I've seen people find

1522
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:03,039
found uh two Gano and cannabis in Thai

1523
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:05,039
literature it the the the the Thai

1524
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,880
writers are very much emphasizing that

1525
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,559
this is a l thing so this was in the

1526
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,240
context one of the really early

1527
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:12,960
references is in the context of a kind

1528
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:17,479
of historical

1529
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:22,278
epic uh which is about the uh huge war

1530
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:24,559
between the LA uh Kingdom and the ties

1531
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:28,358
that happened um

1532
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:30,240
basically it was 1830s maybe I got it I

1533
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:33,038
don't quote me on the dates but not

1534
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:35,959
super long ago but anyway

1535
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:38,039
um the LA kingdoms got quite

1536
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:41,679
expansionists uh under a guy called ja

1537
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:44,359
onong I think it was they got ambitious

1538
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:46,598
tried to sort of seize bits of LA and in

1539
01:06:44,358 --> 01:06:49,119
return the ties basically just

1540
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:51,920
annihilated uh venan and all the big

1541
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,838
cities of wow of L particularly like

1542
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,960
literally raised it to the

1543
01:06:53,838 --> 01:07:01,798
ground moved all of population into isan

1544
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,760
into Thailand across the Mong and

1545
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:05,639
because they wanted to have more people

1546
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,079
there because it was one of the big

1547
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:09,038
problems the ties have always had is

1548
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:14,119
that the population density was too low

1549
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:15,599
for them to uh sort of uh tax Farm the

1550
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:18,240
they they wanted more people there to

1551
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:23,079
tax basically yeah that makes sense for

1552
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:26,199
the state to to grow and um yeah so it

1553
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:27,920
was a kind of um

1554
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:29,639
the reason there's a very big L

1555
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,440
population in isan is is partly

1556
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:33,920
artificial basically so it's a lot of

1557
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,838
people moved and

1558
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:40,760
um the

1559
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:42,599
um the culture from a very early all the

1560
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:47,599
indications are is that the can cannabis

1561
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:49,838
is associated in thae culture with uh

1562
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,519
rural um

1563
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:55,159
populations particularly ethnic La

1564
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:56,318
populations and there's a very very

1565
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:58,038
strong

1566
01:07:56,318 --> 01:08:01,679
uh status

1567
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:03,520
Association in the in Tai culture is

1568
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:06,919
very very status conscious like it's

1569
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:08,000
worse than the English or any kind of

1570
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,159
snobby

1571
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:14,559
culture you can choose so all of the

1572
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:18,158
politics of Thailand are all about the

1573
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:22,480
big city Bangkok versus the the the

1574
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:24,079
countryside basically and so this the

1575
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,959
reason I'm giving all of this kind of

1576
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:27,600
context is that

1577
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:29,119
it's not surprising to me at all as

1578
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,679
someone who knows these areas fairly

1579
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:32,599
well it's not surprising to me that the

1580
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:35,679
law has been changed back in Thailand

1581
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:38,600
now to ban cannabis again oh is it did

1582
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:41,679
they change it back yeah yeah so they're

1583
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:44,319
gonna by sometime this I forget they've

1584
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:46,640
got a few more months perhaps and then

1585
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,520
they're going to just ban recreational

1586
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,520
use again it's another question about

1587
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,799
whether they'll actually be able to

1588
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,839
enforce that but um at this stage but

1589
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:58,079
the absolutely no surprise to me at all

1590
01:08:55,838 --> 01:09:01,559
whatsoever that the the consensus has

1591
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:05,000
been that in in the Bangkok Elite that

1592
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,920
this should not be allowed uh and

1593
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,158
they're going to do what the British

1594
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,158
have done they're going to basically

1595
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,879
copy our model of like allowing some

1596
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:15,039
medicinal industry that them and their

1597
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,759
mates will get to cash in on so the kind

1598
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:20,238
of industrialists and Elite will get to

1599
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,838
make a killing out of the medicinal

1600
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:24,198
industry but and everyone else can go

1601
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:26,039
[ __ ] themselves and get a prescription

1602
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:28,079
or go to jail you know

1603
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:31,119
it's not much different than the US like

1604
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:33,679
to be hon it really ended

1605
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:36,278
up

1606
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:38,399
yeah so it's the same it's the same sort

1607
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:39,960
of whatever dialectic whatever you want

1608
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,519
to say disc course it's

1609
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:46,119
basically cannabis is a is a is a is a

1610
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,120
peasant drug basically in to put it in

1611
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:51,719
the bluntest terms in in Thailand

1612
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,880
now that means that some people have a

1613
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:55,840
some Elite establishment types have a

1614
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,719
kind of affectionate attitude towards it

1615
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,640
it's like oh it's the country bumpkin

1616
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:03,399
kind of thing other people look down on

1617
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:06,719
it disdain for it sure and there's the

1618
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:09,198
definite hierarchy you know in terms of

1619
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:13,319
things like amphetamin and and opiates

1620
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:17,279
and stuff in Southeast Asia that's that

1621
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:19,880
about Elite versus

1622
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:22,960
rural Poor Man's drug rich man's drugs

1623
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,480
and various in between yeah um and

1624
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,079
cannabis is definitely the poor man's

1625
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:30,639
drug you know

1626
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:32,158
so wild yeah [ __ ] up we we assume it's

1627
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,000
like oh it's part of the culture quote

1628
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,879
unquote but it's from much more

1629
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,238
complicated than that in Asia you need

1630
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:40,239
to have a kind of sense of how

1631
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:43,119
stratified and fractured all of these

1632
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:45,119
countries are in terms of the culture

1633
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,719
and the geography and how that relates

1634
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:47,800
to to cannabis it's it's not

1635
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:50,039
straightforward you know it's not

1636
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:53,640
straightforward that they're going to

1637
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:58,079
legalize in India by any means um and it

1638
01:10:53,640 --> 01:11:00,719
is very strongly connected to how the um

1639
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:04,198
political establishment relate towards

1640
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:06,840
the uh minorities and and

1641
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:08,519
Village communities in terms of how they

1642
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,279
see it and there's all kinds of

1643
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,360
complicated ideas about smoking versus

1644
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:15,880
eating it and which is smoking is

1645
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:19,519
generally not okay and maybe eating it

1646
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:22,520
is kind of okay and it's so it's so it's

1647
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,600
not at all the question that it's like

1648
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:28,880
um the shorthand that we in the West

1649
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:32,120
tend to go for like uh the Americans

1650
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:34,679
came and banned it and bl it's like yes

1651
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:39,079
and but no not really there were moves

1652
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:40,279
to ban these things long before the um

1653
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:42,920
uh

1654
01:11:40,279 --> 01:11:47,880
American Germany or whatever was a thing

1655
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:50,359
and and and a lot of the the the um

1656
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:53,079
British involvement ironically was

1657
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:54,559
strongly lent towards not making it

1658
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:57,679
illegal because the British were there

1659
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,960
to make money in in India and places and

1660
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,158
the loudest voices who were pushing for

1661
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,560
it to be made illegal were generally

1662
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:08,759
Indians yeah of a certain establishment

1663
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:10,800
type of in of mentality in India that

1664
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,320
regarded this stuff as unacceptable you

1665
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,480
know and that was nothing to do with uh

1666
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:18,880
them being contaminated by puritanical

1667
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:21,119
Western ideas these were like

1668
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,800
locally

1669
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:25,840
born ways of thinking about these

1670
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,000
substances that

1671
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,360
Associated them with undesirable groups

1672
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,319
like cannabis was very strongly

1673
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:34,158
associated with Muslim culture in India

1674
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:36,840
for example uh particularly the smoking

1675
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,679
hashish was associated with Muslims yeah

1676
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,279
and then in far as it had any Hindu

1677
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:43,279
connections it was Associated often with

1678
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,198
Village forms of Hinduism that were seen

1679
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:48,158
as being

1680
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:51,799
um sort of folk versions of Hinduism

1681
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:56,238
that were not sophisticated and or all

1682
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:59,000
were contaminated with um

1683
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,759
uh you know unorthodox forms of Hinduism

1684
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,198
that were disapproved of you know so

1685
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:05,119
there's all kinds of like nuances in

1686
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:07,719
there in terms of it um you know it's

1687
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:09,599
not it's pessimistic but I can't I'm not

1688
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:11,279
like anticipating some glorious future

1689
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,960
age of legalization there going to be

1690
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,840
around the corner unfortunately there

1691
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,279
was a while where I thought maybe maybe

1692
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,800
because the money will decide it and

1693
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:22,158
then I'm no it's not it's not going to I

1694
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:27,119
don't think we're going to be like

1695
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:30,000
living in some global legal situation

1696
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:32,359
anytime soon basically yeah it just

1697
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,359
seems like no matter what happens it's

1698
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:36,479
always going to be putting the hand the

1699
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:38,799
the money into the hands of the few so

1700
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:41,559
maybe opening it up you know built this

1701
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:46,000
Market but closing it back down puts it

1702
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:49,400
back into the 1% type situation yeah

1703
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,479
yeah it's it's pretty difficult once

1704
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:54,519
yeah basically I think so and once it's

1705
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,039
been once you've got a Prohibition

1706
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,199
scenario like

1707
01:13:56,039 --> 01:14:02,198
extricating yourself from

1708
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:04,799
that you know it's not straightforward

1709
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:07,319
especially when there such a strong

1710
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,840
plutocratic sort of oligarchical

1711
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:13,679
tendency in in in our dysfunctional

1712
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:15,560
democracies these days it's like when

1713
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,319
you combine that with how difficult it

1714
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,560
is to have a sensible discussion about

1715
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:25,238
these types of topics in the in the

1716
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:28,440
media these days it's uh it's yeah it's

1717
01:14:25,238 --> 01:14:30,439
very tricky you know yeah for sure yeah

1718
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:33,399
I mean there's people in the USA that

1719
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:35,119
you know applied for licenses and

1720
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:37,399
because and didn't end up getting it for

1721
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:40,679
whatever reason and then now they're on

1722
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:42,519
paper and now they get raid like it's

1723
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:44,319
yeah it's it's been wild to watch it

1724
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:46,960
happen over the past you know however

1725
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:48,759
many years and uh I can't imagine it's

1726
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,679
going to get any better anywhere after

1727
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:53,760
people have watched the rich sort of

1728
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,600
take over the whole

1729
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,880
industry yeah yes I mean I I don't know

1730
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:02,000
like

1731
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,560
um I I was very not optimistic but I was

1732
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,719
kind of cautiously optimistic that like

1733
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,760
even if it wasn't for the right reasons

1734
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,158
we might end up with legalization sure

1735
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,199
um

1736
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:16,719
because you know and and the quirks of

1737
01:15:14,198 --> 01:15:18,439
the political system in the states where

1738
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,239
you can have these sort of referenda and

1739
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:22,039
stuff referendums in places like Oregon

1740
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:24,439
or whatever

1741
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:27,920
that we don't have anything like that in

1742
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:29,519
the UK equivalent to that so I was sort

1743
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,000
of watching somewhat enviously and

1744
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,600
thinking yeah well it's only a matter of

1745
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,079
time before you've got Federal

1746
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,199
legalization I noticed Harris has been

1747
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:38,519
saying she's going to do that and things

1748
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:40,279
who knows you know I mean maybe they

1749
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,600
will but it does require like some

1750
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:46,759
courage on the part

1751
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:49,360
of um people in power to actually do

1752
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:50,920
what they know I mean talk to any of

1753
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:54,679
these people they will know what they

1754
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:57,560
should do and but they'll always do sort

1755
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:59,880
of some sort of half-hearted fudge in

1756
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:02,000
the end you know I mean you know the

1757
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,639
chance of like having sensible laws

1758
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,600
about actually kind of properly

1759
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:09,119
dangerous drugs is is very unlikely

1760
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,600
anytime soon and particularly given that

1761
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:15,238
even the sort of more enlightened

1762
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:18,360
discourse around these things is is so

1763
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:19,718
um incapable of you know like I'm

1764
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:21,158
thinking like you see all this talk

1765
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:22,920
about psychedelics these days and

1766
01:16:21,158 --> 01:16:25,479
psychedelics this and psychics that and

1767
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,039
it's like yeah okay but you know are we

1768
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:28,599
going to just we're g to go we're going

1769
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:29,479
go and legal these things legalize all

1770
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,760
these things and then we're going to

1771
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:33,678
leave like the actual [ __ ] like fentel

1772
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,840
and heroin and mess or whatever that

1773
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:39,158
right actually is really where you need

1774
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,679
to change the law yeah if you were

1775
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:43,679
actually concerned about not having all

1776
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:45,719
these people dying and stuff uh but yeah

1777
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,600
it's like uh you

1778
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:51,399
know cannabis ex exceptionalism

1779
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:55,440
psychedelic exceptionalism and all this

1780
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:55,439
stuff it's like uh

1781
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,119
is a whole is a whole other conversation

1782
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:04,639
but um I don't see it's going to feature

1783
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:07,198
anytime soon in the sort of any any any

1784
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:09,039
any serious discussions basically you

1785
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:11,399
know I I just recently learned that in

1786
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:14,760
Oregon um because someone got busted

1787
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:18,279
there um seeds seed cells and stuff is

1788
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:21,039
is a serious felony if you you're not

1789
01:17:18,279 --> 01:17:23,800
like you know fully legal with paperwork

1790
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:25,800
and everything and they yeah dude went

1791
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,920
to jail still

1792
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,560
yeah kind of blew my mind because when I

1793
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,520
think of Oregon like when I visited um

1794
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,880
it's it's very open cannabis wise much

1795
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,199
more open than where I'm at in

1796
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:41,199
California obviously like red are I'm

1797
01:17:38,198 --> 01:17:43,759
not up to speed but yeah like it it it

1798
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:47,000
seemed pretty I don't know normalized

1799
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,119
there but uh the seeds if you're not

1800
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,840
legal you know you don't have all your

1801
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:55,479
paperwork in it's a lot more serious

1802
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:58,319
penalties uh

1803
01:17:55,479 --> 01:18:01,158
yeah yeah it's very tricky it's so sort

1804
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:04,039
of So like um there's such a big gray

1805
01:18:01,158 --> 01:18:06,638
area with all of this stuff it's uh you

1806
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:08,479
know in the UK itself totally

1807
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:10,560
uncontrolled in terms of moving the

1808
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:13,359
seeds in and out of the country yeah

1809
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:17,719
it's not there's zero regulation on it

1810
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:20,759
like literally none you know yeah it's

1811
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:23,239
um as in to to leave the borders of the

1812
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,880
UK and come into the UK you know sure

1813
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:27,079
but it obviously for the destination

1814
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:30,199
countries that's becomes infinitely more

1815
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:33,559
complicated but absolutely it's it's so

1816
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:35,678
um it's it's so uh it's so so sort of

1817
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,840
surreal this is the thing though I mean

1818
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:40,239
and I I tend to repeat myself so just

1819
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,560
steer me onto something else if I'm

1820
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:44,519
getting boring sure go ahead the weird

1821
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,039
thing is with the the UK is it's not

1822
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:50,880
historically actually been a country

1823
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:54,000
that has tended to to prohibit stuff you

1824
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,400
know yeah like Narco colonialism was one

1825
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,760
of the most IAL aspects of our history

1826
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:01,158
in terms of things like opium and and

1827
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,199
all of that so yeah Colonial history

1828
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:06,359
imperialist history of the UK was drugs

1829
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:08,279
were a huge part of it the the elite

1830
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:11,639
discourse of this establishment figures

1831
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:13,719
you know sort of liberal old school

1832
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:15,840
liberal kind of 19th century 18th

1833
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:17,239
century liberals for the most part just

1834
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,560
like in so far as they knew about these

1835
01:19:17,238 --> 01:19:20,319
things just didn't give a [ __ ] it was

1836
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,719
like well that's something they do there

1837
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:25,880
can we make money out of it yes y can we

1838
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:28,800
tax it yes great you know yeah

1839
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:32,199
subject you know and then um in in in

1840
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,560
the UK itself like uh you know heroin

1841
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:38,879
was available on prescription as late as

1842
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:42,560
the the 19 19 late 1960s you know you

1843
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:45,840
could still yeah yeah and and um it was

1844
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,800
regarded as a as a opiate addiction was

1845
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,560
a medical thing the notion that it

1846
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:52,239
should even be considered criminal was

1847
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:55,480
completely just anathema to the whole

1848
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:57,599
way it was de with you know um

1849
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:59,759
so you know people like William Burrows

1850
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,400
and all these kind of beat type

1851
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,039
characters would come to the UK and

1852
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:05,759
stuff you know because it was so because

1853
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:08,158
it was such a common sense culture

1854
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,800
towards these things you know yeah but

1855
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:15,158
then they obviously went like off the

1856
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:17,199
rails dramatically by the 70s yeah and

1857
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:20,679
um partly

1858
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:22,519
for actually kind of historical reasons

1859
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:24,319
not necessarily to do with America per

1860
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:27,600
se but it was you know largely sort of

1861
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:31,238
American let the the the move towards a

1862
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:34,120
more aggressive Pro prohibitionist

1863
01:20:31,238 --> 01:20:39,439
stance yeah but it

1864
01:20:34,119 --> 01:20:40,719
um yeah I mean uh you know even though

1865
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:43,319
sort of I think it's probably the same

1866
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,399
in the States now like doesn't matter

1867
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,158
how far right you go really most people

1868
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:49,960
in in the

1869
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:51,719
conservative politics in the UK would

1870
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,560
would if you talk to them on a personal

1871
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:54,639
basis even publicly not would be like

1872
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,920
yeah of course it shouldn't be

1873
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:59,719
criminalized you know should be yeah

1874
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:01,440
legal you know everything you know but

1875
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:03,679
um yeah that's wild so much different

1876
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:06,519
than the US I mean I maybe maybe

1877
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:10,639
politicians on the right would say that

1878
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,639
privately but definitely not

1879
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:15,079
publicly I don't know if it's a it's a

1880
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,760
religious thing because our country

1881
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:19,519
religious sorry sorry what was that I'm

1882
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,840
not sure if it's a religious thing

1883
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,239
because our country is so religious

1884
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,440
based or or what the difference is

1885
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:28,198
there I mean it definitely one of the

1886
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:32,638
major

1887
01:21:28,198 --> 01:21:36,238
um dividing lines between the US and the

1888
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:40,880
UK was the there was a strong

1889
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:43,319
disapproval of of uh British imperialism

1890
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:46,800
particularly in Asia yeah you know in

1891
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:50,079
World War II the Americans were just

1892
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:52,440
very openly like why the [ __ ] should we

1893
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:54,079
even be helping you guys keep control of

1894
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:57,238
your colonies you know ignoring the

1895
01:21:54,079 --> 01:22:02,319
hypocrisy the Philippines and whatever

1896
01:21:57,238 --> 01:22:05,799
but but um the attitude was that and and

1897
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:07,158
and and and it was uh even before then

1898
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,480
the League of Nations when the first

1899
01:22:07,158 --> 01:22:10,638
kind of international attempts of

1900
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:13,638
prohibition happened we're talking kind

1901
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:15,760
of 1920s and stuff um it was the

1902
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:17,880
Americans and the Egyptians who led the

1903
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:21,079
move to kind of include cannabis on all

1904
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,079
of the um antopia laws which were the

1905
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:25,279
real driver of the first attempt to like

1906
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:30,158
internationally prohibit drugs through

1907
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:32,279
the League of Nations preu type idea the

1908
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:34,399
it was the Americans and Egyptians who

1909
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:37,519
were really led the charge especially to

1910
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:40,039
get cannabis included on the on the laws

1911
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:43,880
and that ironically that was using data

1912
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:45,920
from the um quotes lunatic asylums of of

1913
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,319
Egypt that the British had actually put

1914
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,000
together because they were kind of

1915
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:53,519
doctors and stuff within the imperialist

1916
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,520
Machinery who were focused on this idea

1917
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,159
that cannabis caused insanity and that

1918
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:02,120
it was Associated criminality and stuff

1919
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:06,439
so it was partly British material like

1920
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:08,960
the research that supported the idea was

1921
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:11,119
was used to support the idea that

1922
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:14,039
cannabis might somehow make you insane

1923
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:16,238
or was associated with violence and

1924
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:17,600
criminality yeah basically because the

1925
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:20,638
British even though they didn't want to

1926
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:23,960
ban these things in in India were were

1927
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:26,400
still quite happy to use the association

1928
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:28,760
between cannabis and like marginal

1929
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:31,519
groups you know groups of men hanging

1930
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:33,560
out on Street in in parks and in urban

1931
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,719
centers like laborers and stuff smoking

1932
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,800
cannabis or what are you doing uh you

1933
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:40,000
know they were quite happy to kind of

1934
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:44,079
police these groups

1935
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,238
using um or you know to control these

1936
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:49,960
groups using cannabis you know so some

1937
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:53,678
kind of radical dervish gets conscripted

1938
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:55,600
into some army unit and it's causing

1939
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:58,000
problems in the Barrack so he smokes

1940
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,639
hash he's insane put him in the lunatic

1941
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,359
asylum you know what I mean so they were

1942
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:04,840
still was still exploiting it to control

1943
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:06,839
undesirable people you know yeah so

1944
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:10,199
there was this kind of paper trail

1945
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,920
associating cannabis with um mental

1946
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:16,359
illness that was used as early as the

1947
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:18,440
1920s to to kind of shoe horn cannabis

1948
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:21,679
into the antiopi Opium

1949
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:25,000
laws wild

1950
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:27,239
yeah I could into this with you for ever

1951
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,880
but I I definitely want to make sure

1952
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:32,479
that we go over some of what you have in

1953
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:35,199
stock because oh yeah yeah sure yeah

1954
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:36,919
please yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah I'd

1955
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,039
love to have you on you know whenever

1956
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,960
you have more time too because like like

1957
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:42,840
I said there each one of these topics

1958
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:45,118
like you you could really open it up and

1959
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,520
talk about it forever and this is uh

1960
01:24:45,118 --> 01:24:51,158
what fascinates me

1961
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,159
uh I know least

1962
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:56,118
about yeah far away like because it's

1963
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,560
better if

1964
01:24:56,118 --> 01:24:59,639
give some questions so that I don't just

1965
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:02,639
drift back onto stuff that some people

1966
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:06,400
would have heard me talk about before so

1967
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:08,920
so the um let's start with uh one of the

1968
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:10,920
ones I had experience with was from uh

1969
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:14,079
the Highland Thai Burmese I think it was

1970
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:16,079
called when it was first released yeah

1971
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:18,600
that one's I thought that was an amazing

1972
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,679
like uh plant that could be done well

1973
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:23,360
indoor I don't know how it would compare

1974
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:26,840
to you know point of origin but it could

1975
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:28,679
be done well in in the USA um what can

1976
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:32,880
you tell me about that

1977
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:36,399
line um so that

1978
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:41,880
um has been through a couple of like

1979
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:46,399
exitu maintenance grows now um

1980
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:48,760
so it's gonna I and I haven't directly

1981
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:51,759
been involved with that since I

1982
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:54,920
originally collected the seeds so any

1983
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:58,960
they may have been inevitably going of

1984
01:25:54,920 --> 01:26:01,039
some possible shifts in what it actually

1985
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:03,760
is now just from the fact that you know

1986
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:06,118
we can't do more than like double digits

1987
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:10,560
in terms of plant numbers of maintaining

1988
01:26:06,118 --> 01:26:15,319
it realistically so

1989
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:17,199
um I got it from uh in in mongon from a

1990
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:21,279
guy who

1991
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:23,000
um uh an exat guy who was based up sort

1992
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:26,118
of you know very near the border with

1993
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:30,079
Burma and they were Hill tribe groups

1994
01:26:26,118 --> 01:26:34,198
um uh who had got a hold of seeds and

1995
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:36,600
yeah it's difficult to know like I I

1996
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:39,279
hopefully we'll be finding out soon

1997
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:42,119
based on genomics analysis of it what

1998
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:44,800
exactly is in the mix but I suspect it

1999
01:26:42,118 --> 01:26:47,399
may have a bit of hybridization with

2000
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:52,440
more like kind of East Asian hemp lines

2001
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:55,118
in there not just a a pure

2002
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:58,399
um it's not like a

2003
01:26:55,118 --> 01:27:00,559
simple kind of pristine ganja uh land

2004
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:04,638
race um

2005
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:06,440
I but there's taii like Shen is another

2006
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,880
name for them kind of groups up in those

2007
01:27:06,439 --> 01:27:10,479
areas who definitely have a culture of

2008
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:13,000
of growing cannabis for themselves

2009
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:15,319
sometimes like it was a real problem for

2010
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,158
uh this friend of mine or rather you

2011
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:21,840
know not friend of mine but a guy I I

2012
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:25,118
met who was um growing up there he he

2013
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:27,600
would do these kind of Gorilla Grow

2014
01:27:25,118 --> 01:27:28,960
yeah with tropical you know really nice

2015
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,719
like tropical lines like kind of a

2016
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:35,719
carola hay and stuff and then they the

2017
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:37,920
plants would get to like you know within

2018
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:39,439
like a couple of days of just being just

2019
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,600
right you know and he goes out to cut

2020
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:44,079
them down and he just find some Shang

2021
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:47,119
come and just taken the whole lot you

2022
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:50,519
know like exactly when it's just like a

2023
01:27:47,118 --> 01:27:52,359
you know he's like [ __ ] that's so brutal

2024
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:55,080
because they really know exactly how to

2025
01:27:52,359 --> 01:27:57,920
grow it themselves so they're like um

2026
01:27:55,079 --> 01:27:59,519
they're waiting for the the perfect

2027
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,359
[Music]

2028
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:05,320
moment the day before he goes out to to

2029
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:06,799
get them take the whole [ __ ] look

2030
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:09,479
that's always scared me about gorilla

2031
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:12,320
grows is is yeah like here they say

2032
01:28:09,479 --> 01:28:15,879
plant one for you plant one for the cops

2033
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:19,559
plant one for the thieves you know yeah

2034
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:23,920
yeah yeah thieving is it's not great but

2035
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:26,280
it's what it is just the the um but yeah

2036
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:28,039
so so I think they were lahu the actual

2037
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:30,399
guys he got the seed from that lahu kind

2038
01:28:28,039 --> 01:28:32,039
of like a Musa is another name for them

2039
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:35,599
they're like kind of a minority group

2040
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:37,158
who uh around those border regions a lot

2041
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,840
there like you know Hill tribe would be

2042
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:42,118
the kind of people would use they and

2043
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,400
they move across the borders between

2044
01:28:42,118 --> 01:28:50,039
China and Burma and L places quite

2045
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:52,879
readily uh and uh I think they were

2046
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:54,880
growing and had got a hold of some seeds

2047
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:59,199
but the thing is around there there's a

2048
01:28:54,880 --> 01:29:02,279
quite a lot of um cultivation of uh

2049
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:03,719
fiber types land races as well in those

2050
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:06,880
areas particularly because it's been

2051
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:08,279
encouraged by the Thai government so

2052
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,039
there's just quite a high chance that

2053
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:12,158
there's been hybrid hybridization

2054
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:15,840
between them like my experience of it

2055
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:18,519
was it was not like a highly potent

2056
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:22,319
compared to what you can have in land

2057
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:24,960
races yeah and then the very tall plants

2058
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:27,960
as well plus the hollow stem tendency

2059
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:30,600
made me think like quite possibly

2060
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:32,960
there's some hybridization

2061
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,880
happened and there certainly other lines

2062
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:36,920
where that's plausible that that's

2063
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,600
happened because they are grown on the

2064
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:42,480
same grow Cycles as the hemp hemp and

2065
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,679
and and and gandja are growing on the

2066
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:47,279
same grow Cycles quite often in those

2067
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:49,319
areas so there's possibility of

2068
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:52,519
pollen Crossing

2069
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:54,799
between populations it's so and I was

2070
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,639
just thinking about it like um

2071
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,119
asking you to explain any of the scent

2072
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,560
profiles and stuff like that but it

2073
01:29:58,118 --> 01:30:02,519
really doesn't translate like because

2074
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:06,039
like you said it's a very

2075
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:07,880
plastic um I wouldn't want to that in

2076
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:10,560
the sense that like

2077
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:12,440
um the Nuance is so hard to get right I

2078
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,760
mean yeah

2079
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:19,678
um when I saw them like he deliberately

2080
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:22,960
had brought down like two the two kind

2081
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:24,960
of main expressions of that that entire

2082
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,480
land race that I mean it may be

2083
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,600
something totally different from what

2084
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:30,839
the Highland TI that goes around in

2085
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:32,840
America under the same name by the way

2086
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,800
probably I shouldn't have used that name

2087
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,800
for it because it just adds to the

2088
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,199
confusion but he brought down like a a

2089
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:40,719
much more kind of light green and the

2090
01:30:38,198 --> 01:30:43,559
light green and the purple batch yeah of

2091
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,279
the same land race and the purple batch

2092
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:48,639
was much more kind of down the mango

2093
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:51,679
Katey end of the smell smell types and

2094
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:54,319
then the light green I much preferred

2095
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:56,000
was more kind of like really hard to

2096
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,279
describe but it was sort of citrus but

2097
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,719
not like straightforwardly it was like

2098
01:30:58,279 --> 01:31:01,399
very kind of

2099
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:04,399
musky

2100
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:06,000
um uh it's very hard to describe smells

2101
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:09,439
but it was a much more compelling smell

2102
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,158
for me and I'm sure would be the

2103
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:15,359
preference if I was working the line was

2104
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:19,198
that that side of it sure

2105
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:21,359
um uh but you know um the other thing

2106
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:23,960
the reason I suspect some Chinese hemp

2107
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:29,839
type East Asian hemp type is the the

2108
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:32,920
leaves um could be very um broad not not

2109
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:35,039
like not like with the the indicia shape

2110
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:37,480
per se necessarily

2111
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:39,679
although I need I need to actually look

2112
01:31:37,479 --> 01:31:42,439
at them again to see where the broadest

2113
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:43,760
point is on them but the but they just

2114
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:45,479
anyway look like something quite

2115
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:50,560
distinct from the real kind of classic

2116
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:53,399
La Ean Thai type um je pool you

2117
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:55,400
know yeah so most of these uh questions

2118
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:58,198
we've actually covered as a course of

2119
01:31:55,399 --> 01:32:00,599
just conversing um yeah there's one I

2120
01:31:58,198 --> 01:32:02,839
mean like almost all of them we covered

2121
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,360
just bying but one one that I think will

2122
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:08,039
be probably the most asked question you

2123
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:10,960
probably when you get a lot is from CCC

2124
01:32:08,039 --> 01:32:13,600
and he asked how to keep pure well pure

2125
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:16,198
relatively pure uh sativ as manageable

2126
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,719
indoors do you have any advice on

2127
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:20,719
that

2128
01:32:17,719 --> 01:32:26,039
um I mean one of the main

2129
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:30,118
um tricks people do that I'm aware of is

2130
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:33,519
um uh you can use pot size to just

2131
01:32:30,118 --> 01:32:36,319
control and and and and like because if

2132
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:38,560
it's really like a pure straight from a

2133
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:41,639
farmer type sativa it's it's they're

2134
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:45,239
going to keep rooting even during

2135
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:49,279
flowering you know yeah so

2136
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:52,959
um you can just pot up in the kind of

2137
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:54,960
second week of flour or so still and you

2138
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,719
should find that the it will still root

2139
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,560
into the new compost which can be good

2140
01:32:57,719 --> 01:33:01,319
as well because it can mean that you

2141
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,840
don't make the mistake of like

2142
01:33:01,319 --> 01:33:07,799
overfeeding too much during flour

2143
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:10,880
absolutely um and the other

2144
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:14,440
thing uh with sativas endorses to try to

2145
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:16,800
not overwater them like it's a really

2146
01:33:14,439 --> 01:33:21,319
important aspect of of traditional

2147
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:24,800
farming of of gja you know C whatever is

2148
01:33:21,319 --> 01:33:29,238
the right irrigation schedule so

2149
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:32,719
even these days um the good quality uh

2150
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:35,198
production in places like LA and stuff

2151
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:39,439
is in areas where they've got access to

2152
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:43,359
lakes or ponds or streams to irrigate on

2153
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:49,359
schedule rather than just allowing

2154
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:51,639
rain fed um you know dict yeah so in

2155
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:55,319
other words the the main good quality

2156
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:58,400
crop is done from sort of sewing in mid

2157
01:33:55,319 --> 01:34:05,079
augusti is and then harvesting kind of

2158
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:07,879
Fe February is so you um uh September is

2159
01:34:05,079 --> 01:34:10,960
or whatever to February marchish

2160
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:13,520
basically six months over the starting

2161
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,359
at the end of monsoon so you can have a

2162
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,880
bit of rain whilst the plants are in veg

2163
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:19,039
but really once you're into flower

2164
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:23,039
you're looking to like have zero rain

2165
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:24,519
ideally and just have irrigation and the

2166
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:25,880
mistake people make endorses to over

2167
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:28,440
water we've already kind of touched on

2168
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,760
that but um the other thing is you can

2169
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:31,678
if there are real land race you can

2170
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,920
prune back pretty [ __ ] heavily if you

2171
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:39,359
want and you can you can you

2172
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:43,199
can um concentrate the uh Bud production

2173
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:46,039
into exactly where you want if you prune

2174
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:48,678
carefully and you can prune like quite

2175
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:51,800
late on in the cycle of growth still

2176
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:55,118
yeah um

2177
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,520
uh yeah think of other things to be

2178
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:58,039
honest with you I'm not like an expert

2179
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:00,920
grower I just know from talking to

2180
01:34:58,039 --> 01:35:02,479
people and and stuff yeah for sure I I

2181
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,039
don't have like a huge amount of

2182
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:06,000
opportunities to grow because of the

2183
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:09,079
amount of moving around I do you know

2184
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,198
yeah yeah can imagine that makes it

2185
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:15,679
hard

2186
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:18,158
um anyway I yeah it's uh but yes sativas

2187
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:21,239
they're not well adapted to in indoors

2188
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:24,238
basically as the bottom bottom line

2189
01:35:21,238 --> 01:35:27,959
really want to be outside and they will

2190
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:29,559
um you know the the the type of land

2191
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:32,880
they want to be on is is a really

2192
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:36,920
important consideration so in the Big G

2193
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:38,719
growing areas of India um in the late 19

2194
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:41,199
30 20th century there was quite a good

2195
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:43,118
documentation done of that whole economy

2196
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:48,359
because it was economically very

2197
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:51,158
significant um and um the land along the

2198
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:54,238
rivers along the Ganges Delta area that

2199
01:35:51,158 --> 01:35:57,719
was very lomy like light

2200
01:35:54,238 --> 01:36:01,079
Sandy loans yeah that don't hold water

2201
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:03,600
too much but are very nutrient Rich were

2202
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:06,000
really sought after by people who wanted

2203
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:09,000
to to to get into commercial production

2204
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,880
you know yeah and um there were

2205
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
techniques which are still used of of

2206
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:15,319
how you prepare the land so you know

2207
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:21,079
still they'll do this still in in

2208
01:36:15,319 --> 01:36:24,079
Southeast Asia as you um create um uh

2209
01:36:21,079 --> 01:36:29,399
ridges you know like raised ra

2210
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:32,960
beds like a kind of semi um Circle type

2211
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:35,559
shape with between them for the water

2212
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,960
and then you plant on top of those um

2213
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:41,360
half circles as it were you know what I

2214
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:43,079
mean so Cur curved the raised bed and so

2215
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:46,238
that means that you the water runs off

2216
01:36:43,079 --> 01:36:47,719
the roots so the thing you're just

2217
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,118
trying to avoid is for the to have the

2218
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:52,920
brot sitting in water logged um water

2219
01:36:50,118 --> 01:36:55,198
logged uh land because that yeah

2220
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:58,520
cannabis just does not [ __ ] like that

2221
01:36:55,198 --> 01:37:00,439
and it will get it'll get infected and

2222
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:02,199
there are all kinds of parasites and

2223
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:04,719
pathogens that were already very well

2224
01:37:02,198 --> 01:37:06,799
known back in the in that time which are

2225
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:11,399
even can ofis specific forms of powdery

2226
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:13,679
milu and stuff you know um and um you

2227
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:15,679
know I these conversations sometimes

2228
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:19,399
with people who are like using

2229
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:22,679
these um what is it

2230
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:24,079
natural um sort of what is it some kind

2231
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:26,399
of like people based basically growing

2232
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:28,960
in this like composting compost it's not

2233
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:32,599
even properly compan natural farming

2234
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:34,158
stuff yeah yeah yeah I get these kind of

2235
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,840
emails from people sometimes and it's

2236
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:40,879
like I try and like be as nice as I can

2237
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:42,480
yeah yeah it's tough like I'm like on

2238
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,159
principle I'm like all for kind of

2239
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:46,919
permac culture and anything like that

2240
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:48,359
it's like but Jesus man like cannabis

2241
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:50,920
does not want to be in that kind of

2242
01:37:48,359 --> 01:37:54,319
[ __ ] situation this guy writing to me

2243
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:58,079
like yeah I've created this amazing

2244
01:37:54,319 --> 01:38:03,319
system where like the soil is wet

2245
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:05,158
247 like RAC love that yeah right no

2246
01:38:03,319 --> 01:38:07,599
cannabis wants to be

2247
01:38:05,158 --> 01:38:10,238
like okay with Hydroponics and stuff

2248
01:38:07,599 --> 01:38:13,199
maybe they've I mean I think in over the

2249
01:38:10,238 --> 01:38:15,359
last 50 60 years like cannabis in the

2250
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:19,198
west has adapted to all kinds of Mal

2251
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:21,519
treatment but sure absolutely has

2252
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:24,598
ultimately yeah you don't want to be

2253
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:27,560
growing a land race in like soggy

2254
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:31,119
incredibly Rich

2255
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:34,480
compost especially like especially not

2256
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:37,719
with like stuff literally rotting on the

2257
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:39,319
surface yeah this guy's like can you

2258
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:41,118
send me like a photo and he sends you

2259
01:38:39,319 --> 01:38:46,198
thing there like [ __ ] cooch grass

2260
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:48,000
like growing in in the same pot do they

2261
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:51,399
do

2262
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,599
that yeah I mean know each their own I

2263
01:38:51,399 --> 01:38:55,559
guess but yeah God bless them if

2264
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:58,960
someone's asking opinion like I feel I

2265
01:38:55,560 --> 01:39:01,080
should just tell them like no yeah just

2266
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,960
don't grow this

2267
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:04,559
type take

2268
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,118
abuse

2269
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,520
yeah um is there any strange you want to

2270
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:11,238
highlight that you currently have for

2271
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,159
sale right now or any anything else you

2272
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:17,839
want to talk about and get

2273
01:39:13,158 --> 01:39:20,759
in I mean I'm really interested like uh

2274
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:22,560
and you can um I we collected a bunch of

2275
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,639
stuff from orisa which is sort of just

2276
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:27,080
south of of Bengal okay uh which I

2277
01:39:25,639 --> 01:39:30,639
suspect is

2278
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:36,000
um uh quite um historically significant

2279
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:40,359
um in terms of the development of um of

2280
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,359
sativas like real tropical CA land races

2281
01:39:40,359 --> 01:39:44,158
uh you know we were talking about

2282
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:45,639
there's that um book the kind of

2283
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:47,359
alchemic it's an alchemical book

2284
01:39:45,639 --> 01:39:50,079
actually the an and theander is the name

2285
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:52,519
of it um where they describe the sin

2286
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:56,599
technique that's from around there kind

2287
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:58,000
of Andres uh orisa area was where that

2288
01:39:56,599 --> 01:40:00,639
was probably

2289
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,039
compiled and um I suspect those plants

2290
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:05,199
are pretty

2291
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:07,560
interesting uh to look at uh they seem

2292
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:10,559
to be like probably more like five

2293
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:15,480
months from seed to harvest uh the ones

2294
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:19,280
we've got and um also

2295
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:23,638
um yeah and and then um planning to have

2296
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:25,079
some napoi um uh ganja land r R

2297
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:27,800
available soon as well which I think

2298
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:30,559
will be pretty interesting I mean just

2299
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:33,840
in terms of product stuff like I'm a big

2300
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:35,239
fan of Southeast Asians but the because

2301
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,279
of the Aromas and stuff and I think

2302
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:41,399
there's been a lot of hybridity

2303
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:43,759
between possibly like independent

2304
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:46,039
centers of domestication south of unan

2305
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:48,960
with the the east

2306
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:52,719
Indian uh sens of domestication I don't

2307
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,760
know this is just a hunch but um anyway

2308
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:57,079
I think these

2309
01:40:53,760 --> 01:41:00,840
uh actual South Asian land races like

2310
01:40:57,079 --> 01:41:02,679
from Arisa and Andre Pradesh and um the

2311
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:05,920
terai regions of nepool are worth

2312
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:08,359
checking out so we've got already uh

2313
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:10,639
some like Dakin khi is the name of the

2314
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:11,799
one from nepool that we've got that's

2315
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:14,480
kind of

2316
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:16,079
uh uh you could say like been

2317
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:18,198
domesticated it definitely has been

2318
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:20,559
domesticated for use as bud not just as

2319
01:41:18,198 --> 01:41:24,039
hash yeah and then the orisa one is very

2320
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:25,239
much specifically for bud and um both of

2321
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:29,198
them I think would be really interesting

2322
01:41:25,238 --> 01:41:32,718
to look at uh really nice Aromas from

2323
01:41:29,198 --> 01:41:34,319
them too as well you know um and types

2324
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:36,840
of effect are really good like very

2325
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:40,000
stimulating and

2326
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:42,960
positive it sounds freaking awesome to

2327
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
be honest yeah yeah I'm quite C to see

2328
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,880
what the genomics work discovers about

2329
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:51,439
them because my hunch is they're

2330
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:54,239
probably that uh East India and Nepal

2331
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,359
and East India are kind of where sativas

2332
01:41:54,238 --> 01:42:00,000
really

2333
01:41:55,359 --> 01:42:01,799
originate first we'll see yeah that's so

2334
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,439
fascinating I can't wait to see that all

2335
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:06,679
work out um where where should people go

2336
01:42:04,439 --> 01:42:09,678
to buy your seeds uh what's the

2337
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:11,639
website um the real seed company.com and

2338
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:14,000
then for the for the modern stuff is

2339
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:16,480
quick seeds.com it's a stupid name but

2340
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,880
it's like what I

2341
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:21,039
originally yeah I'd originally planned

2342
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,679
it as like a budget thing I was just

2343
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:25,599
going to buy a bunch of like Cheapo

2344
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:28,279
Dutch SE and sell it on there and [ __ ]

2345
01:42:25,599 --> 01:42:31,840
it I'm just don't want to get into big

2346
01:42:28,279 --> 01:42:34,479
business stuff and so it's kind of just

2347
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,159
but um yeah that's where we've for the

2348
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:38,479
time being anyway all the all the kind

2349
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:42,960
of really interesting 90s material we've

2350
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:47,079
got and some other um there's like some

2351
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:49,920
later 90s things like uh Cinderella 99

2352
01:42:47,079 --> 01:42:51,118
Amnesia uh which is really good very

2353
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:54,118
strong as well if you're looking for

2354
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:56,198
like strong uh really strong stuff and

2355
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:58,279
then some Colombian

2356
01:42:56,198 --> 01:43:02,799
um

2357
01:42:58,279 --> 01:43:04,559
um uh like a Colombian import that's

2358
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:06,960
probably like a Northern Lights crossed

2359
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:11,080
with a Colombian land race then crossed

2360
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:12,639
with some like um um air Colombian and

2361
01:43:11,079 --> 01:43:14,079
Mexican things all kinds of things like

2362
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:16,880
that you can find there and a whole

2363
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:20,599
bunch of just like kind of fun hybrids

2364
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:22,800
with things like uh Pakistan TR tral

2365
01:43:20,599 --> 01:43:24,840
Kush crossed with like some land races

2366
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,639
which be great like for just making hash

2367
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:31,360
and stuff and or for

2368
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:36,199
