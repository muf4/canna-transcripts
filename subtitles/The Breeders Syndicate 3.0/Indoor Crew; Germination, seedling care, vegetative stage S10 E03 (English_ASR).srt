welcome to reader Syndicate 3.0 the next

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,678
evolution of the look into

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,039
counterculture that is Canon my name is

00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,960
Matthew owner of Riot seeds and this

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,359
started as a one-man mission for strain

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,160
history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,559
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,640
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
Illuminati and other friends throughout

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
the seasons to hear their takes on grow

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,320
techniques breeding science strain

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
combat the Nar the corporate cannabis

18
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,600
Syndicate welcome to P Syndicate I'm

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,760
Matthew I'm here with thousandfold and

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,480
we have some other guests with us today

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,920
and today we are going to be talking

22
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,119
about um the vegetative situation I

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,559
guess you would say is that correct

24
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,679
thousand maybe you can word it better

25
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,959
yeah that's right we're just going to

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,719
broadly talk about the vegetative state

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,478
age we we have talked about growing

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,239
indoors in general obviously but I

29
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,280
thought we could focus in on things like

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:13,640
germination seedling care cloning stuff

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:17,359
like that um uh also just yeah fadan

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,359
tried to get us demonetized right away

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,519
so no I just to start with I'm coming

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,520
there he

35
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,078
go um I thought to get us warmed up even

36
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,599
though you guys have all told us about

37
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:30,279
your setups I thought for this episode

38
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,759
you may as well just briefly tell us

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,840
about your setups again U maybe start

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,319
with local just just broadly local like

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,040
the yeah for sure dude um so I don't

42
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:44,118
have like too extravagant of a grow it's

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,159
you know a nice size closet that I use

44
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,200
for veg I have a storage rack in there

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,920
um that I use so I can keep like my solo

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,560
moms and stuff and then like off to the

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,478
sides um I'll keep like full-size moms

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,359
just so I can actively take cuts off of

49
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,879
them and then kind of cycle through

50
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:06,359
stuff that way um it's kind of my first

51
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,758
year in this setup because like I moved

52
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,639
um so it's it's been working pretty

53
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,799
decent I'm still trying to get used to

54
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:17,119
the temperatures um but like in flower I

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,160
have a 5x5 I grow under LED

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,200
lights um and yeah I kind of just uh

57
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,560
grow mainly using one gallon pots and

58
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,560
let them

59
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,319
rip oh yeah nice yeah I'll just I'll go

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,760
right after that but my setup's very

61
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,199
similar instead of a closet it's a 2x4

62
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,759
tent with a rack in

63
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:43,919
it and um just kind of used that for

64
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,560
different things you know popping seeds

65
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:53,039
and stuff like that um just general veg

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:55,560
stuff um I don't I have like um I have a

67
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,560
big veg ENT that I sometimes I don't

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,439
know it's it's kind of like my in

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,120
between flower and veg tent area where

70
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,919
PE where like I will get um I'll

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,959
transition uh plants into bigger pots

72
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,479
and stuff like that you know so I will

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,640
vent that tent into my little 2x4 so I

74
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,280
don't have like any like p uh like

75
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,518
actual like any fans in there sucking

76
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,959
anything out just a little bit of

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,560
passive air and just kind of keep it

78
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,719
nice and humid in there and let them

79
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,199
hang

80
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,878
out yeah it's pretty similar to what I

81
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:31,039
have I just have for my veg setup I just

82
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:34,479
have a little 2x4 it's connected to my

83
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,000
4x4 with a duct and so um it passively

84
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,959
pulls through it when it's uh exhausting

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,239
through the tent and so um yeah just a

86
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,598
little two two shelf can pop some seeds

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,239
half the time I have to clear it out to

88
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:49,518
dry in so it's tenuous but I just bought

89
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,640
a house so I'm hoping to build out a a

90
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,799
nice framed room like a real working

91
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,759
space again

92
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,599
soon yeah that's kind of one of the main

93
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,399
reasons why I dry in the fridge because

94
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,598
otherwise I'd have to use the grow space

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,760
which I don't want to

96
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,598
yeah for sure I got still try that out

97
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,239
especially now once I have my new space

98
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,878
I'll have room for a second fridge it's

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,239
like just for drying weed holding seeds

100
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,840
and stuff I can't wait for you to get

101
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,680
more room so we can see all the weird

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,040
experiments you're GNA do yeah man like

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,600
I want to do all kinds of [ __ ] it's just

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,519
like what can I afford to like do

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,919
realistically off the bat and so like I

106
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,879
want to do like a enough space for like

107
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,839
a

108
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:30,199
4x8 um like 2,000 watt or like uh 2 LED

109
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,038
fixture set up and actually start moving

110
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,600
through some populations

111
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:40,399
again y y I tend to like drained waste

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,120
Coco like I'm always running containers

113
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,560
drained waste Coco that's how I've

114
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,840
always done it because most of the time

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,399
I was renting right and you couldn't

116
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,159
really be like the first time I was

117
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,159
trying to run flood and drain tables in

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
apartments and when you have like an

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,680
emergency situation they want to you

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,280
know have a 24-hour inspection that

121
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,079
that's a that's a death note and I

122
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,399
learned that really quick so I just went

123
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:07,399
to drain to waste uh Coco drain to waste

124
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,399
uh Coco Pete Moss peite

125
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,038
mix oh

126
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,159
sorry what's that don't you grow

127
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,560
outdoors Now Matt for now yeah for now

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
but and still that's the way I did it

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,959
outdoor this this round too was uh very

130
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,000
very shittily trying to apply indoor

131
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,719
techniques to outdoor so yeah that

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,279
didn't work so well I think next time

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,639
I'm going to do them much bigger pots

134
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,478
and probably uh pre- amended soil as

135
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,720
opposed to bottle feeding I you should

136
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:42,519
go right in the ground man I want to see

137
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,360
you do like like a bajillion little onef

138
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,639
Footers you know what I mean yeah be

139
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,439
funny start them in like [ __ ] August

140
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,120
1 just like a little like 10inch

141
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,600
seedling and then just like grit them

142
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,120
out and then like I just think about

143
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,680
like a it's possible like a CSI model

144
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,439
with like a little space you know what I

145
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,959
mean where you're cramming tons of small

146
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,560
plants into whatever you got and so have

147
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,120
you guys seen that Instagram page

148
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,879
stunted

149
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,519
doart no it's pretty rad I I showed it

150
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,120
to CSI the other day and he was tripping

151
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,399
out too like it's basically these buds

152
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,280
they call them Bud sticks I think they

153
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,638
were calling them and it's it's like

154
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,318
Solo Cup growing but they're literally

155
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,598
like six Ines tall it's just like a big

156
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,160
old fat bud and it's like they they have

157
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:27,038
it all gritted out with like 30 of them

158
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,439
just like fats everywhere and I was like

159
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,839
you know what like that's really

160
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,120
respectable cuz they're actually growing

161
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,638
really well in these little tiny cups

162
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,800
like it's it's decent Bud it looks

163
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,038
exactly what I'm talking about yeah I

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,680
love this yeah I thought it was cool and

165
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,800
it's it's all in how they train it all

166
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,639
how they they do it how they fire it off

167
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,439
but yeah check it out some if I man if I

168
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:52,280
ever try to force myself to run like six

169
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,680
to eight that's what I would have to do

170
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,839
yeah yeah they've got it down to a

171
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,319
science it's pretty

172
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:03,758
neat yeah it's just cool to see yeah it

173
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,280
is er did you want to add anything er I

174
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,840
cut you off earlier no I was going to

175
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,439
say the same thing Matt was saying I do

176
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,519
drain to was as well I just didn't

177
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,279
mention like medium or anything like

178
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:18,959
that um but that's I think I think quite

179
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:22,119
a few of us do like drain yeah I do as

180
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,478
well yeah same but I do uh I do promix

181
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,319
which is the pat mive yeah the same

182
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:30,399
exact thing I like the the pr miix HP

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,160
yep

184
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,799
okay well how about we move on to

185
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,840
germination and I wanted to ask n this

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,280
one uh partly because

187
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,598
it's I think n's very good at telling us

188
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,638
about like his journey when he was first

189
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,478
learning and I because germination is

190
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,759
one of those topics that has like I

191
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,598
don't know everyone has their own

192
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,360
opinion yeah I'm gonna be a Nazi on this

193
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,079
one so I'm gonna let you guys go all

194
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,080
before I rip it all

195
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,719
apart mat has opinions for sure very

196
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,079
opinionated on this specific one yeah

197
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,960
yeah and tell us about like what you

198
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,560
know what you first tried what was like

199
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:07,719
what you read about online maybe that

200
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,478
kind of thing yeah um so like uh I I

201
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,879
remembered I mean when I was in

202
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,959
elementary school we learned how to

203
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,039
germinate lime of beans putting them in

204
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,799
uh a paper towel and a paper in a

205
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,800
plastic baggie so I did that you know

206
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,400
that's I knew how to germinate seats so

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,158
I did that and it you know it worked

208
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,239
fine I think like sometimes I would

209
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:30,000
dampen them off by leaving in there too

210
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,918
long or something you know um then I uh

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,479
then I started reading about how you

212
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,038
needed to use like maybe it would help

213
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,000
to have like a heat mat you know what I

214
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,598
mean and I so I started thinking man I

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,879
need a heat mat so I got one of those

216
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,800
and I started uh the first time I did

217
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,439
that I had like a plate and a wet paper

218
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,240
towel in it and it was sitting in there

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,320
and I left it overnight with no paper

220
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,639
bag or anything it just dried out killed

221
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,240
all of them so um then I was like that

222
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,278
was stupid I don't know why I thought

223
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,680
that would work so I uh put a bag on it

224
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,838
the next time thinking this is going to

225
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,239
work it did not it also dried it out

226
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,480
somehow because those plastic baggies

227
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,720
are not like you know obviously

228
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,639
impervious to moisture loss and so um it

229
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,200
dried out killed them so then I was like

230
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,240
all right look this is crazy I don't

231
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,079
need to be doing the heat mat obviously

232
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm killing a lot of seeds so I um I

233
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:26,039
ended up just started like I soak mine

234
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,759
for 24 hours like in water I just I

235
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,759
don't like push them under the water or

236
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:33,759
anything I literally just like blo them

237
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:36,240
on top of some water they they float for

238
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,600
like 24 hours I take a look and just

239
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,159
make sure that they look like their kind

240
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,519
of opening I don't do any kind of weird

241
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,639
seed cracking or anything like that I

242
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,560
tend to just put them I take them and

243
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,600
put them straight into my I I use like a

244
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,159
just my cocoa and just put them straight

245
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,759
in there water it with a really really

246
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:58,039
light nutrient solution and like the

247
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:01,120
same stuff that I use for my clones and

248
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,120
then that's it I just

249
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,199
um yeah sorry well and that's and I will

250
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,360
say that's been really successful for me

251
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
like I have really good germination

252
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,440
rates with it I don't you know I don't

253
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,919
have I don't tend to I just for me I

254
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,160
feel like the more I mess with it the

255
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:23,278
more I tend to like mess something

256
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,719
up Scouts got opinions too um I was just

257
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,559
going to say that uh ger learning how to

258
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,160
germinate seeds when you're in school

259
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,639
for me was one of the most magical

260
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:36,360
things like uh looking back it kind of

261
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,039
really stands out in my mind as like I

262
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,919
don't know yeah it's still so cool to me

263
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,559
that like you plant this little thing

264
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,519
and then a couple weeks later you have

265
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,799
like this root ball you know what I mean

266
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,000
it's it's amazing like how fast it all

267
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,559
is amazing I mean the tech like look at

268
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,639
the tech of the seed like

269
00:10:51,559 --> 00:11:00,518
it's it's amazing yeah um sorry little

270
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:05,399
interjection um who's next uh Dan local

271
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:08,399
yeah I'll go um I I really like um

272
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,240
sprouting in like a real kind of soil

273
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,200
blend if I can like especially if it's

274
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,399
going to go outdoor I kind of like to

275
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,800
have it in more of like a real like

276
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,078
where it's going to end up like I don't

277
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,719
really like going from like a inert

278
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,239
media to then like a living like like a

279
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,800
100 gallon smart pot or something like

280
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
that that you've been amending for years

281
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:29,159
and like has its own biology going on

282
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,879
and so um I've done a bunch of stuff of

283
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,278
like direct sewing like right into the

284
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,559
soil too like actual like mineral soil

285
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,078
and the plants blow up so quick and

286
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:41,159
they're so happy um but then like birds

287
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:44,359
eat them and [ __ ] um but uh when I'm

288
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:48,399
growing inside I uh um always just start

289
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,759
in my promix and um occasionally if I'm

290
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,120
like really like they're rare seeds or

291
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,720
something that I don't want to lose I'll

292
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,480
do what like er was talking about of

293
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,920
like I'll soak them in a little bit of

294
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,360
peroxide um let them just like open up

295
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,360
and just shoot that tail out and then

296
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,800
I'll put them immediately into the media

297
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,919
and that way you can like you know put

298
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,919
them in upside down so to speak or like

299
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,519
how the shell opens up you know what I

300
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,799
mean that comes up and then you have the

301
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,679
two calans that come out of that and so

302
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,639
you can definitely put your seedlings in

303
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,359
the ground and then have like a root

304
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,839
just pop right up you know and then

305
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
everything else so it's completely

306
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,519
inverted and so um I don't really do

307
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,879
anything that special I just like to go

308
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,839
right into the soil as soon as

309
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:34,879
possible

310
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,360
all right local you're up yeah so um one

311
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,240
thing that I kind of always do with my

312
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,000
seeds is give them a bath in H2O2

313
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,039
hydrogen peroxide

314
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,440
3% about two

315
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,198
minutes um and then after that I mean

316
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,160
recently I've kind of been choosing to

317
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:54,679
soak my seeds for 24 hours and they

318
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:56,039
usually Crack by then um I'll move them

319
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,759
to

320
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:02,759
the um into like a moist paper towel

321
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,240
after that um just cuz I I'm like kind

322
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,519
of anal about checking the progress not

323
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,519
not like checking it every day but being

324
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,278
able to have eyes on you know what's my

325
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,240
seed doing yeah

326
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,879
um and then once I kind of see that tap

327
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,759
rout like actually like stick out stick

328
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,159
out I'll just move it to Coco um but

329
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,759
yeah

330
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,198
um other than that that's kind of what I

331
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:33,078
go through I I mean everything been

332
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:36,958
relatively new so I haven't done any

333
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:38,679
fancy germ texts and [ __ ] like that I

334
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,439
was going to actually I wanted

335
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,838
to kind of prompt something around the

336
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,560
paper tow method and to a degree also

337
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,880
the soaking method I guess one benefit

338
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,278
is that you get some additional

339
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,439
information before you s you sew um so

340
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:52,919
at least you know whether or not the the

341
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,199
seed cracked or whether there's a tap

342
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,360
route before it goes in that's one

343
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,278
advantage I can see I personally I just

344
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,720
like soaking and sewing without even

345
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:05,159
seeing the seed crack or the tap rot um

346
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,440
but yeah I think that's obviously one

347
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,399
one quite big

348
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,959
benefit um I guess I can also add every

349
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:15,360
time you open that towel you are risking

350
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:18,159
something entering you know so it it's

351
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,600
not ideal to check it but it's like you

352
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,039
said it's one of the advantages um it's

353
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,199
not like I'm looking every [ __ ] 10

354
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:29,480
minutes um it's once every other day

355
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:33,159
change the towel um after that

356
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,079
I I mean after a few days you can kind

357
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:38,759
of see like little spots of mold

358
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:41,359
sometimes if you've left it orange and

359
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:45,039
brown so I mean paper towel is just like

360
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,000
a prime medium for any kind of mold or

361
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:51,078
bacteria so yeah that's kind of why I

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,519
moved away from that is I started like I

363
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,439
would get busy or something and you

364
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,839
leave them in 24 hours too long and then

365
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,920
suddenly they you start having losses

366
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:03,440
over that mold

367
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:07,399
all right kids all right let me CH the

368
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,040
[ __ ] riots in all right so now now what

369
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,958
I will point out is that a lot of you

370
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,078
guys what you're talking about is

371
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:17,198
popping modern new seeds and that all

372
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,599
these are perfect for that um during the

373
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,159
time when I was learning how to pop a

374
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,480
lot of seeds were very old that were

375
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,799
being sold by the Dutch as their their

376
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,800
seed stock so I was learning on a lot of

377
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,278
really old seeds and they were still

378
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,919
really expensive at the time I mean like

379
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,159
you know uh a pack of blueberries

380
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:38,879
$350 from DJ sh for example some of the

381
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:41,039
ceny seeds like uh Jack herrer again

382
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,278
$300 they were all kinds so we were

383
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,480
spending lots of money on these seeds

384
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,720
and it wasn't like it was like a lot of

385
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,278
people would use this argument that in

386
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,079
nature that trees drop their own seeds

387
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:57,078
and they sprout on their own in the dirt

388
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,599
everything's fine right but a tree

389
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:00,000
generally speaking if it's getting

390
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,879
pollinated a cannabis plant it's

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,318
dropping tens of thousands of seeds for

392
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:07,078
one to grow in that spot ultimately to

393
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,919
grow under it um so it's not a really

394
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:10,958
good odd system to be playing if you're

395
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,479
spending hundreds of dollars on seeds so

396
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,119
what I learned early on was to be as

397
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,720
sterile as possible and that was just

398
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,198
for making all kinds of mistakes using

399
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,160
people's like hippie Voodoo powder you

400
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,399
know saying oh this this you know humic

401
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,879
acid's great you know wash your seeds in

402
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,639
this dip them in this you know all that

403
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:33,439
[ __ ] and it all I saw was just infection

404
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:36,959
uh uh seeds not popping they start stall

405
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,600
out mushiness so that's when I started

406
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,919
looking into using the the hydrogen

407
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,159
peroxide wash for seeds first because I

408
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:44,360
was thinking okay a lot of these seeds

409
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,399
are coming from like a PM environment

410
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,959
like no doubt like some people are going

411
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,278
to sell seeds from PM environments right

412
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,039
so I want to clean off that husk first

413
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,120
before I put in anything second thing I

414
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,360
want to do is wash the hell out of my

415
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,519
hands like people dig in their ass their

416
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
nose scratch their [ __ ] head you know

417
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,399
all day touching everything and a lot of

418
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,599
people forget like how important it is

419
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,119
to wash your damn hands before you start

420
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,038
messing with something or you're gonna

421
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,798
bring you're going to want like um an

422
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,558
anerobic environment is that right local

423
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,078
is that the right word Anor robic

424
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:18,879
environment you want it to be as sterile

425
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,599
as possible just sterile yeah sterile

426
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,839
you want it sterile so so you know if

427
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,759
your hands are dirty that's a you're

428
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,918
already introducing issues so if you if

429
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:30,960
you've washed it in H22 solution a light

430
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:35,080
one um wash the outside I like to dip my

431
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,840
paper towel in a uh mixture of H2O2 and

432
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:39,599
water but a lot lighter than I would

433
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,678
when I wash the actual seed and then I

434
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,719
ring it out because the other important

435
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,400
part is the the consistency of the

436
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,120
moisture in the paper towel you don't

437
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,000
want it sopping wet that's not a good

438
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,399
thing you want your your seed to have to

439
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,759
work to get to the water outside of it

440
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,400
um yeah and and then there's other other

441
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:59,158
cases where like people give up on seeds

442
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,120
when it's really just a a really thick

443
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,760
healthy shell and no no moisture is able

444
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,599
to enter and there's certain things I do

445
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,038
like hand cracking seeds um sometimes if

446
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,558
they're really old seeds I'll hand crack

447
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,000
ahead of time so that they don't have to

448
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:12,399
use a lot of the stored energy or

449
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,038
whatever's left of the stored energy in

450
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,038
their shell to work to break open that

451
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,720
shell and do all that process just to

452
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:20,400
try to help it have enough energy to get

453
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,360
out easily uh another thing I do is I

454
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,519
like to hang the the plastic bags in the

455
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:28,000
backside of a cupboard door like so it's

456
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,558
dark where it's at I like to hang them

457
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,679
uh you like tape I tape to the back side

458
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,119
of it and that's just so like it acts

459
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,360
like gravity and pulls the seedling

460
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,000
taper it downwards like that's important

461
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,519
for me I I don't like trying to plant

462
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,440
something ultimately it's all curly cued

463
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,119
it makes it annoying doesn't you know

464
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,240
you want to plant it nice and that just

465
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,879
makes it easier uh another thing that I

466
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,319
do it's a lot different from people is I

467
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,080
let the seedling grow until I see the

468
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:57,399
green cotaling um in in the actual

469
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,240
baggie I don't immediately plant it the

470
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,080
first second I see a tab the main reason

471
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,798
for that is because I I want the plant

472
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,279
if if something does um infect like

473
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,000
whether it's from the cocoa the medium

474
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,639
wherever in between planting it and

475
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,400
getting it in there if something does

476
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,159
start to attack the root Zone I want to

477
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,320
be able to feed it from the top from its

478
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:16,880
from its actual leaves and the true

479
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,678
leaves are just about to pop up at that

480
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,200
point if you wait that long so that's

481
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,480
just another reason that I like to do

482
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,200
that it's just like ultimately giving

483
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,798
that seedling the ultimate chance to

484
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,319
make it and that's just from learning on

485
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,359
Old seeds and having a lot of rare

486
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,279
strains and and and having to play the

487
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:35,240
odds games of okay there's four of these

488
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,079
seeds that we have left on earth like

489
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,919
all of them need to make it they're all

490
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,119
really old what's the best way to do

491
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,640
this and that's like I always use that

492
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,079
method on even new seeds just because

493
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,679
it's be I it become a force of habit but

494
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,879
that's that's uh really where I like to

495
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,559
take that you know um there's other

496
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,000
things we do like jellic acid treatments

497
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,359
and whatnot but I I highly don't

498
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,798
recommend doing that because it it it it

499
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:00,319
gives other issues um I wouldn't do that

500
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,639
unless I absolutely had to with old

501
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,639
seeds but everybody should know how to

502
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,679
do it if they ever have to yeah that's

503
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,440
as far as that's cool because I I had a

504
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,000
question about like how long you could

505
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,400
leave them you know in like paper towels

506
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,880
or whatever because I thought maybe you

507
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,519
were risking you leave them in there a

508
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,360
long time A lot of times like the the

509
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,639
the tap roots and will grow into the

510
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,079
paper towels and stuff and you just kind

511
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,320
of gently tear it apart real slowly you

512
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,798
know move it out but other than that

513
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,798
it's it's I I like making sure that I

514
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,319
have a fully established plan in the

515
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,798
cleanest environment possible before I

516
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,319
put it in that's essentially it uh would

517
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:38,279
you mind elaborating a little bit on

518
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:41,639
like what it actually takes to crack uh

519
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,759
these with thick shells I know you've um

520
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,360
so so like I would use let me see if I

521
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,319
can have a pair here yeah so what I like

522
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,439
to do is use really small really sharp

523
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,319
scissors they have these bers or

524
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,960
whatever they're called on um oh no

525
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,720
these are singer ones um on Amazon I

526
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,400
think they like five bucks a piece

527
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,798
they're really small really sharp and

528
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,440
precise and you can actually have really

529
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:05,480
really tight motion of movement and you

530
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,558
can feel when the seed the shell

531
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,880
actually is penetrated because it'll pop

532
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,558
you can feel it and because because

533
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,360
they're small and you have really

534
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,359
precise movement of it you can stop

535
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,639
before you then cut the embryo because

536
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,719
once you once you've cut the embryo

537
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,799
you're killing the plant uh or or the

538
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,880
seedling inside so you only want to do

539
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,639
enough to gently penetrate the shell

540
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,840
enough for water to get in sometimes

541
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,759
it's easy enough to do with like

542
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,519
matchbooks and like rubbing the seedling

543
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,960
against a matchbook covering some people

544
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,798
have luck with that and that'll be

545
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,880
enough but I I've always had a lot of

546
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,519
luck with

547
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,919
these man those techniques freak me out

548
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,158
but I know that like you have to do it

549
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,159
for some you know under some conditions

550
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,720
I've just never done it before um um

551
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,320
with the like the the very first round

552
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,600
of the Clockwork Orange s1s a lot of

553
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,439
people had to learn how to do hand

554
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,759
cracking because it was just the the the

555
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,120
seeds were [ __ ] vigorous as hell but

556
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,319
you had to get water in there and they

557
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,119
were just so the shell was so thick and

558
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:02,038
healthy that you had to crack you had to

559
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,759
do it to get them in there so yeah it

560
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:06,000
only happened one round but I have seen

561
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,319
cases where like really healthy seeds

562
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,640
needed yeah I know I've seen it too yeah

563
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:12,480
and I see a lot of people throw away

564
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,880
seeds like that don't pop and they don't

565
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,440
even look at why they're not popping

566
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,840
they just like oh no bummer seed uh

567
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,200
shitty breeder you know

568
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,359
like it's like it happens but I I like

569
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,000
to make people aware that maybe they

570
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,240
should try that before they uh totally

571
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,278
give up and and back to the the sterile

572
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,720
part like I'm leaving him in these um

573
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:34,640
these bags sometimes for up to 10 days

574
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,558
like to fully form these seedlings and

575
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,919
stuff I Chang the paper towel anytime

576
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,038
that I check it to open it I change it

577
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,840
instantly like I change it every time um

578
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,440
and I do it often every three days at

579
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,079
least I change that paper towel whether

580
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,038
I'm checking it or not like I have to

581
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:53,079
change it because you you just want to

582
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:57,158
keep it clean yeah that's about

583
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:59,558
it man this is this is making me realize

584
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,080
that if I were smart this whole episode

585
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:02,519
would just be germination and then we

586
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,158
could have gotten like five episodes

587
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,359
from this but oh well yeah I think I

588
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:11,000
covered it pretty

589
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:13,199
well did you yeah Reflections on what

590
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,679
Matt said yeah well I was just gonna say

591
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,840
like I had never really thought about it

592
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,640
I remember hearing you talk about it I

593
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,759
think on your cracker the the video

594
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,600
where you talk about cracking seeds and

595
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,400
you talk about like cleanliness and it's

596
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:26,480
like I'd never like I always think about

597
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,679
it as far as like well I don't want to

598
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,599
be extremely dirty but I had never gone

599
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,759
as far as just like literally the oils

600
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,359
on your skin don't touch your face like

601
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,558
avoid all those types of Motions like

602
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,000
you're working like that's how you have

603
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:39,798
to be when you work in a tissue culture

604
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,480
last essentially yeah yeah yeah and so

605
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:44,720
like applying those principles to even

606
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,759
just those initial steps like helps a

607
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,079
lot yeah um I also was thinking while

608
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,919
you were talking about the gibberellic

609
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,759
acid I was like oh we should play around

610
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,120
with other more gental cyto Canin

611
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,400
because there's definitely a bunch of

612
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,239
others that like induce cell elongation

613
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,159
and like stem growth and all those

614
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,200
things that may actually work a lot

615
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:07,360
better than gibberelic acid because it's

616
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,400
so like such minute quantities yeah when

617
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,558
I I try to tell people like um I get I

618
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,798
got a lot of questions about using

619
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,480
jellic acid and the first thing I'll

620
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,359
tell people is do you actually need to

621
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,640
use it or you just assuming you need to

622
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,918
use it because if it's not old old old

623
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,360
seeds that are already having trouble

624
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,440
popping do not use it don't just use it

625
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,359
because it because what it does is it

626
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,320
causes the the seedling to like be like

627
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:30,519
a two foot tall seedling just picture

628
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,038
that like like barely true leaves coming

629
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,519
out having a twoot tall seedling that

630
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,960
you have to stake and then it tries to

631
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:39,558
grow taller from that and elongate it

632
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,960
takes a few months for the the deic acid

633
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:45,359
to stop being so active so you're like

634
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,278
trying to grow a a solid plant on top of

635
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,879
Taffy bottom so you're trying to clone

636
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,640
off as fast as you can you know so don't

637
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,399
use it unless you fully have to and

638
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,559
understand what you're using before you

639
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:58,639
do it pain in the ass funny enough they

640
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,119
actually found that gibber IC acid

641
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,200
number three uh from some kind of rice

642
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,319
fungus or a fungus that would infect

643
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,120
rice and cause rice to elongate a lot

644
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,240
more than it would but they found it I

645
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,959
believe beneficial and then began to

646
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,919
synthesize it um there's like 60

647
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,240
something different forms of gibberelic

648
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,080
acid I've talk about three yeah number

649
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,000
three yeah is the is the one that like

650
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,278
is almost always used um the other ones

651
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,440
I've never tried the other ones to be

652
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,519
honest I don't even think they're

653
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,720
commercially available like

654
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:35,038
that I heard number 20 is the

655
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,480
best number 20 was popping but yeah just

656
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,960
a little fun fact yeah they called it a

657
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,720
foolish rice syndrome when they were

658
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,960
first discovering it because they they

659
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,278
would elongate so tall and and collapse

660
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,960
and so the plant would die yeah yeah

661
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:50,720
that's exactly what weed does like it it

662
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,720
elongates and then folds over on itself

663
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,200
like caffy it

664
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,519
sucks yeah man it's fascinating I have

665
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,720
seen photos of uh can plants that have

666
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,519
like stretched themselves to

667
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,240
death something kind of abject about

668
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,839
it sometimes too like I I this just

669
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,480
happened to me recently like I was

670
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,759
popping a bunch of ogs ones and we only

671
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,798
got like 50% germ rate but the seeds

672
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:18,119
were like fully beautifully developed

673
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:20,759
like still that nice rich tiger stripe

674
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:23,959
on it and everything and like I cracked

675
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,480
a bunch uh they just wouldn't go and so

676
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,200
just because you like get a seed and it

677
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,679
looks great doesn't doesn't mean

678
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,360
anything yeah I white seed that pops

679
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,880
pretty high rate too yeah I had um one

680
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,398
of my early early rounds with the SR71

681
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,120
Purple Kush and I made a big bag of fem

682
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:43,119
seed s1's with it I thought I was going

683
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,199
to be rolling in bank because this is

684
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,599
like

685
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,558
2009 yeah money you know purple kushes

686
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,678
ones and not a goddamn one with pop and

687
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,440
they looked so healthy and so nice and

688
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,480
none were viable and as you kind of

689
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,440
lifted them you realized that there

690
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,038
probably wasn't a solid developed embryo

691
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,960
because they just didn't have that heft

692
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:03,440
that they needed but they looked perfect

693
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,079
and they weren't soft and you couldn't

694
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,798
like hand crack them you know it it

695
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,079
sucked and and I know CSI run into it

696
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:11,679
too it's just one of those things where

697
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,918
you just don't know it's gonna happen

698
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,240
until it happens or why it happens um

699
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,919
are you like referring specifically to

700
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,798
Fem seed or would that ever happen in a

701
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,600
r

702
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:27,200
case for me it's only been fems word I I

703
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,439
would inbred fems too yeah I've never

704
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,480
had a happen with regs ever I don't

705
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,080
think CSI has either for sure yeah it

706
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,399
pops up occasionally like if I pop 15

707
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:40,359
different like fem hybrids like maybe

708
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:41,839
one um if it's a hybrid out of all of

709
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,558
those and that's not even every round

710
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,398
it's like every other round or maybe

711
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:48,000
more but the like the S1 stuff

712
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,839
especially like the ogs it's just like

713
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,720
it's already inbred and then you just

714
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,639
inbreed it further and you know even the

715
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,519
ones that pop like they're runty little

716
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,240
messes you know

717
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,558
so

718
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,038
man fascinating stuff we probably come

719
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,038
back to this since uh to some degree uh

720
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:07,119
at the end because we're going to talk

721
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,359
about tissue culture which you know

722
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,798
there's going to be some overlap there

723
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,678
there's one thing I did want to touch on

724
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:17,000
too and I think it is going into this

725
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:18,480
and it was only um maybe maybe I'll wait

726
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,038
it was just something that ER mentioned

727
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,960
briefly about giving seedlings nutrients

728
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,919
but we could touch on that

729
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,319
whenever yeah no that's cool we're about

730
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:30,200
to go into seedlink here um and just

731
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,839
before I'm going to hand this to Dan but

732
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,240
just before we start like what I think

733
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,398
this is cool to talk about is that it's

734
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,440
just that awkward period of like the

735
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,879
first one or two weeks and I don't think

736
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,679
when I look it up people don't write

737
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:46,360
that much about it um wouldn't think so

738
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,200
it's not well known yeah Dan do you want

739
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,719
to start us off yeah so like I'd say

740
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,440
like the number one thing I'm always

741
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,440
like watching and like looking for

742
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,558
regardless of any setup or anything is

743
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,240
just those initial dyb backs like you

744
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:02,240
really don't want to keep that young

745
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,640
seedling oversaturated you want it to

746
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,599
have like a nice aerobic medium to move

747
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,600
through and have healthy roots and um if

748
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,199
you don't see Roots hitting the edge of

749
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,839
like you know a 3-inch pot by the end of

750
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,440
like the second week like you you're o

751
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,519
probably overwatering you know what I

752
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,200
mean like um especially in Coco I see it

753
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,079
because it's like Coco's dryback are

754
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,679
kind of weird like I never used to like

755
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,359
to let it get like where the color

756
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,759
changes on the Coco but like you still

757
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:34,359
want it to be light you know and and not

758
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:35,679
like keeping it too wet all the time why

759
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,199
yeah and that's why I kind of like moved

760
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,240
away from it for the promix is uh like

761
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,080
it's kind of the same thing I guess but

762
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,079
like I just have it's it's got a larger

763
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:47,398
margin of error and I'm easy as [ __ ]

764
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,000
these days um and so um but I would

765
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:50,439
really be looking at like what media

766
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,079
you're starting in because like there's

767
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,320
a lot of soil Blends especially if

768
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,720
you're in soil that come with fertilizer

769
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:59,038
in it and you don't need to give it hot

770
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,960
yeah yeah yeah man like if you're in the

771
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,000
like kings mix or the um I forget what

772
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,720
it's called the green bag of the royal

773
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,798
gold

774
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,360
oh ocean Forest is yeah ocean Forest has

775
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:14,000
probably got two to four weeks of food

776
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,759
in it you know what I mean like um but

777
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,558
so I don't really normally start with

778
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,839
very much food at all I'll probably do

779
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:21,319
like my like I'm on Cutting Edge and so

780
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,079
I'll just throw a little bit of edge

781
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:26,798
like literally like 200 or 300 parts per

782
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,319
million um and I'll even then water it

783
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,000
down a little more from there you know

784
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,480
what I mean like I like it to be really

785
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,519
light for those first few um um but then

786
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,558
I occasionally I'll throw in like some

787
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,798
additives like I really like the

788
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:42,359
primordial solution SE green it's good

789
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:45,879
for everything it's like a compost tea

790
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,479
extract uh fish fish and kelp based and

791
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,519
uh you fo your spray plants with it and

792
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,599
it's just like they [ __ ] love it and

793
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,440
it's uh it's got enough food in it too

794
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,119
where you could literally just do that

795
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,880
I've also had really good results with

796
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,038
Mills starter um don't really know what

797
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,639
that is I think it's a kelp based Nitro

798
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:05,038
feed I think it's like a 600 but you're

799
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:07,879
only adding like a few MLS a gallon and

800
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,440
so the bills bro yeah exactly it runs

801
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,440
the hills

802
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,319
too it

803
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,880
does I've also used super thrive in the

804
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,798
past that was kind of like an old school

805
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,039
I like dude people [ __ ] on it because

806
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:24,119
it's a technically a pgr but like the

807
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,720
old dude who ran who like created super

808
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,599
Thrive he was he would go like and talk

809
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,600
to every one who bought his [ __ ] if you

810
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,558
wanted to talk to him break

811
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:36,599
down yeah yeah that that dude was cool

812
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:39,638
um but um I hate when people oh you use

813
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,959
pgr you pgrs and I'm just like dude

814
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:43,759
there's it's so rare to see anyone like

815
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,720
like nobody has protocols for like I

816
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:49,960
spray LX is a pgr isn't it it's a pgr

817
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,079
yeah rooting hormon pgr kelp is loaded

818
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,880
with like hund I think it's like 80 to a

819
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,158
few hundred different like minute

820
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,278
quantities of different pgrs and stuff

821
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,960
like it's it's they're a lot of them are

822
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,519
naturally occurring and so like if you

823
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,159
use kelp you're kind of using pgrs

824
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,960
they're just naturally derived and so

825
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,159
it's like if you're using salts then

826
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,558
like what the [ __ ] do you care yeah I

827
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,960
just I just imagine how many people are

828
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:13,440
using clonex [ __ ] on pgrs and you're

829
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,679
like what the hell I'm pretty sure

830
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,000
clonex has some sort of an antimicrobial

831
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,679
in it too and think so yeah you know

832
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,240
what I mean because like I know I've

833
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,559
seen other like organic quote unquote or

834
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,839
more allnatural rooting gels and uh yeah

835
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,240
they uh yeah we get into this in the

836
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,918
next one of the later topics but I just

837
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,960
think that that's so funny when people

838
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,799
get caught up on the pgr thing because

839
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,798
like even at commercial scale like

840
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:38,879
nobody if it's not like a commercial

841
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,798
weed

842
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,278
product then we don't even know or like

843
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:45,558
then no one's doing it like no one's

844
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,558
like blending Custom Blends of phyto

845
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:50,519
hormones and like spraying them on the

846
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:52,440
plants and has done the R&amp;D to like see

847
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,000
like oh well this makes the buds bigger

848
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,600
but doesn't affect anything like um that

849
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,638
used to be like pack beol back in the

850
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,000
day and the like Bush load and [ __ ] to

851
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:04,839
keep the plant short and um but yeah

852
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,960
when anyway back to the main topic

853
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,839
seedling care yeah I mean I just try and

854
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,000
do really low and slow I've definitely

855
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:14,278
been that idiot that puts like you know

856
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,278
I don't know like eight or 900 PPM and

857
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,720
just like fry stuff right off the bat or

858
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:21,440
like over amends like I like to throw a

859
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,240
little bit of a an all-purpose like dry

860
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,840
Amendment into my promix and so I've

861
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,480
definitely over amended that before too

862
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:32,720
um blend big batches don't blend like

863
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,200
top dress little pots you can't you

864
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,278
can't measure the quantity you need

865
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,000
you're just gonna kill your [ __ ] and yep

866
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,200
um I've actually probably killed more

867
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,759
seedlings at this stage than [ __ ] up

868
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,200
germinations for sure oh yeah yeah

869
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,000
easily yeah I'm also a clut and so I

870
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,679
always kill one just by like you know

871
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,440
falling on it or by existing yeah just

872
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,080
existing around the plants and like

873
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,840
somehow one of them gets just [ __ ]

874
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,558
deadheaded right off the bat I'm like

875
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,319
that sucked anyways bro

876
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:01,440
yeah

877
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,439
exactly [ __ ] that PL I mean to me it is

878
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,000
always incredible like how little water

879
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,000
they do need at that stage like I I

880
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,239
start with like a dropper and then

881
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,519
sometimes they don't I they don't need

882
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:17,719
anything for like a over a week yeah or

883
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:20,960
more yeah um Erin what are your thoughts

884
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:24,678
on uh what's your Vibe with early

885
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,960
seedlink here yeah I mean so I direct so

886
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:31,519
they pop I'm in Coco like said sometimes

887
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,519
I'll use like promix or I don't know

888
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,280
like if I'm at the hydro store and like

889
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,280
some some some soil that I'm at that

890
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,480
that I'm okay with is on sale I'll get

891
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,040
it and use it for to start seeds with

892
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,559
you know um like recently I have some

893
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:49,079
nectar for the god soil that they had on

894
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:51,119
sale um and so I've started stuff in

895
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,280
there but basically like if if I start

896
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,599
so if I start seeds in soil that's

897
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,839
amended I won't I won't give them any

898
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,760
nutrients I just will give them plain

899
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,480
water and like I will give them a little

900
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,119
bit of like um some kind of

901
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,039
beneficials um so like I use like the

902
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,800
vam Ando mix or whatever you know of moo

903
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:13,639
and I'll just give a little bit of that

904
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,519
give them a little bit of water but if

905
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:19,239
I'm in C my cocoa then I use I mean I

906
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:22,039
use can of&amp; B so I'll mix it very very

907
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:25,199
light like super light you know like I I

908
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:27,838
measure it with a I use a pen I know

909
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,000
it's like some people love them some

910
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,838
people hate them but I use a you know a

911
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
PPM pen and I'll mix it like my water

912
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:39,400
comes out at like zero like 20 PPM like

913
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,838
super duper low so when I'm when I'm

914
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:46,400
talk when I mix something light I'm

915
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:49,119
talking like 200 PPM maybe um and I I

916
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,079
feed that just because they're in you

917
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:56,160
know cocoa and Coco has nothing in it um

918
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:58,480
but uh otherwise I just try to make sure

919
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,559
they dry back really good you know I

920
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,440
that's I focus more on stuff like that I

921
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,480
focus more on good watering

922
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,760
practices and just making sure that I'm

923
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,000
not like overwatering at that stage um

924
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,119
more so than the food and stuff I think

925
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,559
that it's probably not like you could

926
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,000
probably go without it for a little bit

927
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:16,000
and be

928
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:23,759
okay yep nice and I will spray it too

929
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:25,440
when they're little I'll spray water on

930
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,480
them instead of just like pouring it in

931
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,838
there because like

932
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,079
I don't know Coco is really easy to like

933
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,679
wash it out and just like really destroy

934
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,039
like where the roots growing and stuff

935
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,879
so I just like to spray it so it's a

936
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,880
little more D so you're not flooding

937
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,160
it that's a really good call um I used

938
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,880
to do that when I was doing big like you

939
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,279
know hundreds and hundreds of seedlings

940
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,760
it's way easier to get in there with

941
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,240
like a two gallon sprayer and just Mist

942
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,280
overhead yeah yeah I will inevitably

943
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,479
pour a little bit too much water and

944
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,319
then like see the seedling start like

945
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,679
floating around or

946
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:04,679
something that's probably not good

947
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:13,480
so local um yeah I don't have much uh

948
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:16,480
different to say um it is a lot of or a

949
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,599
lot of it is in watering practices um

950
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,960
most of my fuckups with seedlings have

951
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,640
been because I've watered them too much

952
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,159
and since the Root's small they can't

953
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,279
drink your dry back's not going to be as

954
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:32,559
big assuming that you're not running

955
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:36,079
extremely high temps or whatever

956
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:39,279
um yeah um in terms of feed I mean I'll

957
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,039
take like a small amount of my main feed

958
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,560
that I use for my veg plants and then

959
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,318
dilute that into like a two gallon three

960
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:48,159
gallon bucket that they sell at Menards

961
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:50,719
and use that um but I don't do that for

962
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:53,559
like the first few days because I mean I

963
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,799
was always told that those calans are

964
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:59,078
going to provide your plant with food

965
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,839
for like that first week of its life um

966
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,680
so there's I mean I don't want to say

967
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,599
there's no need to feed it that early

968
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,358
but if you're in Coco you might want to

969
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,640
start earlier rather than when they need

970
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:14,318
feed because you can [ __ ] can go south

971
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,639
fast in Coco that early especially if

972
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:19,480
you're not adding food

973
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,480
um but

974
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,480
yeah

975
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:29,679
um Matt any anything to add

976
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,279
mat I just were you going to come in on

977
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,399
yeah yeah I mean like when it comes to

978
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,880
seedlings like I just I really don't

979
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,960
believe they need food until the first

980
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,838
few weeks um usually when when you start

981
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,280
to see it gently slowly like you don't

982
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:46,838
you don't want to let it get yellow

983
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,280
right when you start to see the color

984
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,279
slightly change that's when I start

985
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,519
feeding always I I don't I don't see a

986
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,440
reason to do it it's just and the reason

987
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:56,719
I like to to give people that advice is

988
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,440
most people will always feed feed in

989
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,959
water too aggressively so I like to try

990
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,679
to set in the opposite direction because

991
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,079
you're probably going to end up hurting

992
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,799
the plant more that way especially for

993
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,920
new Growers you know and I always assume

994
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,960
most people are new Growers that're

995
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,880
asking

996
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,159
questions that's about it yes

997
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,640
sir no I think that was great I think

998
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,838
that might be that little section might

999
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,400
be new to some people um just in terms

1000
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:22,159
of some of those

1001
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,760
considerations um like you said

1002
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:27,759
especially the newer

1003
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,880
grows um we can move on to the

1004
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,800
vegetative stage in general um and I

1005
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,440
thought we'd invite local to start this

1006
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,680
one um what comes to mind local I mean

1007
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,720
we've got a few obviously a few

1008
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,318
different things you could speak to but

1009
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:45,318
when you think about the vegetative

1010
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:48,318
stage yeah what immediately comes to

1011
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:48,318
mind

1012
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,480
um yeah that's a tough not tough

1013
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,239
question but there's a lot that comes to

1014
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,400
mind

1015
00:39:55,239 --> 00:40:00,759
um I I mean I feel like when you're in

1016
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,880
veg you kind of want to run warmer temps

1017
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,040
higher humidity to kind of like let your

1018
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:10,200
plant know that it's summertime you know

1019
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,039
um I typically like to run my medium a

1020
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:15,199
not a lot more moist than I would in

1021
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:17,279
flower but I wouldn't allow for larger

1022
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,199
dryb backs in veg

1023
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,440
particularly

1024
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:25,399
um and let's see I mean I grow a lot of

1025
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,960
my stuff in Solo cups if I'm being

1026
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:31,639
honest um

1027
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,039
so I mean it's just like trying to cycle

1028
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:37,879
through them

1029
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:41,759
um in terms of feed nothing too special

1030
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,920
I just use the Cana A and B like n um I

1031
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,599
found that plants and veg aren't

1032
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,440
necessarily as sensitive as plants and

1033
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:53,480
flower with their veg diet or with their

1034
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,358
diet um but again that's not all strains

1035
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,639
I mean for example Matt's blue resin

1036
00:40:56,358 --> 00:41:01,559
dude off the bat at ha to Jax which is

1037
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:05,759
high in N can't really separate n from

1038
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:08,358
the calcium so I just had to switch uh

1039
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,119
because I was not GNA accept a plant

1040
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:14,239
that looked like that um but I don't

1041
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,039
know yeah it

1042
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,598
it's it's not hard I also don't want to

1043
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,800
say it's easy

1044
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:25,039
but I don't but too much thought in it I

1045
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,920
can let me rephrase part of this for you

1046
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,880
like what what would you worry about is

1047
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,880
is there much that you would worry about

1048
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,760
worrying and veg all right um it's a

1049
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,599
little more specific uh I guess staying

1050
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,400
on top of your IPM bro because like

1051
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,720
that's really the only place you can

1052
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,880
actually actively do your IPM without

1053
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:50,799
you know busting the bank buying insects

1054
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:54,400
or you know relying on insects to figure

1055
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,400
your problem out uh so yeah I kind of

1056
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,079
just like to stay on top of spraying and

1057
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,680
veg um that's honestly kind of why I

1058
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,480
like veg a lot though CU you know it

1059
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:10,399
allows you to fix any errors that may

1060
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:14,199
have occurred but yeah um I also you

1061
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,680
know veg is where my moms are at um I'm

1062
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:18,480
much more lenient about my flowering

1063
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:20,639
plants getting less water than my veg

1064
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,880
plants because like they [ __ ] in my

1065
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:25,400
vegro that you know it would suck to

1066
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,160
have to hunt through stuff to find

1067
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,720
something similar

1068
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:31,719
um so yeah just keeping [ __ ] alive

1069
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:39,440
really awesome good way to start this

1070
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:43,480
topic um can p it to

1071
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,358
earn yeah for sure um I mean a lot of

1072
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,639
things I'm going to Echo I think like I

1073
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:51,159
try to for my veg face like I'm okay

1074
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:55,159
with the the temperature and humidity

1075
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:57,639
riding a little higher um like for me

1076
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:59,960
specifically just to like say kind of

1077
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:02,799
where I am like with lights on a lot of

1078
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,960
times I'll be like around like 80 82

1079
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,800
degrees um in my tent so I'll let my

1080
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,838
humidity ride up into like the 60s a bit

1081
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,079
you know I know that like the VPD thing

1082
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,759
is kind of like a joke sometimes you

1083
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,480
know like it's made into a meme or

1084
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,760
whatever but like using the VPD charts

1085
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,039
like has is is what help me as a

1086
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,960
beginner I mean to like give me an idea

1087
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:28,920
of where a plant needs to be and stuff

1088
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,838
you know I'm not saying that it's like

1089
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,519
an end all Beall but like if you're just

1090
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,799
starting and you don't really know what

1091
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,318
the plant needs that's like pretty you

1092
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,119
know that that'll get you in the

1093
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:44,400
ballpark um so I I kind

1094
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,838
of will sometimes use I don't do it

1095
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,838
anymore but when I was starting I would

1096
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:51,838
you know really dial my tens into those

1097
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:54,400
numbers and stuff and um I've noticed

1098
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:57,279
that like some plants do better with

1099
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,760
lower lower humidity some do with better

1100
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,599
you know it just depends it just depends

1101
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,400
on what you're using but um I think

1102
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,960
stuff like that get you into good

1103
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,720
ballparks um and I did want to just say

1104
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,240
here that um one of the points that

1105
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,118
you've made in the past I think is

1106
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,118
really good you're not following these

1107
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,079
numbers necessarily because they're

1108
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:18,318
perfect uh you're you're paying

1109
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,160
attention to them because that way you

1110
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,519
can calibrate your own grow relative to

1111
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,558
something you know it's actually

1112
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:28,759
something you can track yeah yeah I'm

1113
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:31,280
big on like having something just a

1114
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,880
baseline I just like to have a baseline

1115
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,200
um because

1116
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,039
uh you know if you have any kind of

1117
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:39,519
issues or whatever and you've strayed

1118
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:43,440
from your Baseline then it's kind of

1119
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:47,400
easy to point out the issues you know um

1120
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,480
so and I I do the same thing for flower

1121
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,039
all you know all stages of life I have

1122
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,079
my tent set into like a a general

1123
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:58,000
parameter and then I just kind of adjust

1124
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,079
accordingly um and so like I think like

1125
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,639
uh you know it gets easier the more that

1126
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,839
you do it you know just looking at your

1127
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:05,239
plants and stuff so that's I that's

1128
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,480
always going to be the thing that I say

1129
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:08,959
is repetition repetition repetition

1130
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,119
that's like the only thing that's made

1131
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,119
me

1132
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,079
better thanks

1133
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,959
man

1134
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,358
Dan yeah so um I I agree with like what

1135
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,519
loc was saying earlier I like to try and

1136
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,239
uh I turn off any like de really have

1137
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:32,000
going and

1138
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:33,759
um really try and just like normally I

1139
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,358
think my relative humidity is kind of in

1140
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,800
like like 60 65 it's kind of that range

1141
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,279
uh where when I'm flowering I try and

1142
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,000
keep it like 45 to 55 but I've seen

1143
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,519
people go up to like 70 75% their plants

1144
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,760
look great um for my lighting I

1145
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:52,599
definitely um kind of as their seedlings

1146
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,559
I usually have it dimmed down and

1147
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:57,960
dropped on top of them so I have led

1148
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,400
bars it's like the 4x4 grid space for my

1149
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:04,039
tent too and so I kind of just dro the

1150
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,519
whole thing down um start at like 20%

1151
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,960
and then as they're growing up my most

1152
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:13,039
of the time I'm vegging at about 50% um

1153
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,960
Power on those LEDs and um that way it

1154
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:18,279
stays nice and cool too don't have to

1155
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,720
run AC really ever um Power bills cheap

1156
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:25,040
for those veg months um feeding and

1157
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:28,159
watering like I'm just like normal like

1158
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,679
I cutting Ed and a nice veg powder that

1159
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,679
I kind of just sprinkle a little top

1160
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:35,000
dressing on the top of the pot and then

1161
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,118
I'm feeding around 1,000 PPM of like a

1162
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,838
veg and

1163
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:42,760
microix um and I mainly use sulfur um

1164
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:44,639
but you have to wait Don't Spray sulfur

1165
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,920
too strong on some like fresh young

1166
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,960
seedlings they will all die um so I kind

1167
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,400
of wait till they're I don't know like

1168
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,159
basically toward the size that you could

1169
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,800
take a clone off of it like a single Top

1170
00:46:53,159 --> 00:47:00,078
Cut um that's when I kind of start my

1171
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:03,079
IPM routine and a a sulfur pyrin

1172
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,880
mix um just to keep anything at Bay I

1173
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:08,280
have an issue with thrips in my area so

1174
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,280
um I kind of always end up with thrips

1175
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:15,359
if I stop doing the

1176
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,280
sulfur um but uh yeah I don't nothing

1177
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,519
nothing crazy special but um I love EG

1178
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,319
too because I like I like moms I like

1179
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,800
keeping keeping them around and keeping

1180
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:27,358
them nice and healthy and so um I have a

1181
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,599
one mom in particular that's just like

1182
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,039
never happy and so it's been my mission

1183
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,039
to figure out exactly what she likes and

1184
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:36,279
I I still don't know but she apparently

1185
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:37,960
not too much nitrogen that that helped

1186
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,960
her too but she's got these purple stems

1187
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,639
and just hates the LED so um like Mom

1188
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,760
health and all that is its own whole

1189
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:47,679
thing too because you can have stuff

1190
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,200
from different eras completely different

1191
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,558
lines and trying to keep them all happy

1192
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:55,399
sometimes is a

1193
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,960
pain I wanted to ask Loco if you'd be

1194
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,160
willing to to speak

1195
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:04,920
on um his recent experience using

1196
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:06,598
uh not uh was it potassium local like

1197
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,358
you you bumped something to try to get

1198
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,480
rid of uh the purple or red stems I

1199
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:16,039
don't know if you want to speak to that

1200
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:19,760
just because it's interesting yeah um

1201
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:22,679
so one thing I've noticed with um Kaa is

1202
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:26,800
It Could lack a little bit in potassium

1203
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:29,519
um now that's just in my grow um I'm not

1204
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,280
speaking for like the line and its

1205
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,199
entirety

1206
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,000
um but what I've noticed is under LEDs

1207
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:39,118
your plants get a little hungrier in

1208
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,559
some departments uh one of those being

1209
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:46,599
potassium um and it's like I had no way

1210
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:50,440
to independently manipulate my potassium

1211
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:54,559
um so what I did is I Got U potassium

1212
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:57,720
sulfate from mpk it's super cheap uh use

1213
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,720
almost nothing in weight um but it's

1214
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,078
just enough to bump um and what I've

1215
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:06,759
noticed is I've uh you know obviously

1216
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:09,160
like within like conjunction of um

1217
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,200
adding phosphorus um you know you're

1218
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:14,838
going to want to bump up your potassium

1219
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:17,639
a little bit um and since I was only

1220
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,838
adding phosphorus before you know my

1221
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:22,798
purple streaking was kind of

1222
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:24,400
like going all the way up the plant

1223
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:27,119
whereas when I've started adding this

1224
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,280
and flower um it's kind of helped

1225
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,960
mitigate that uh quite a bit and I've

1226
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:37,000
also noticed tighter Stacks um my sweet

1227
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,079
pee for example um it used to have

1228
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,039
really larger like really large inter

1229
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,720
noal spacing

1230
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:46,239
and you know the one input that's

1231
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:49,318
changed is bumping up pottassium

1232
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,439
and uh it's like almost made it a little

1233
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:54,519
more compact kind of not like rugged but

1234
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,679
just

1235
00:49:54,519 --> 00:50:01,960
overall kind of decent stature I don't

1236
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:07,639
know um I've ran the plant four five

1237
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,639
times now um so I mean it's doing

1238
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,559
something yeah um if Matt I'm just

1239
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:17,798
remembering your prompt but uh if anyone

1240
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:20,480
has any thoughts on red stems under LEDs

1241
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:23,039
and uh you know anything you've tried to

1242
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,039
help mitigate that check it in the

1243
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,400
comments um in fact you know any

1244
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,119
anything that we've discussed you know

1245
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,599
seedlink care any of that germination

1246
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:32,519
I'm sure many of you have opinions so

1247
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,359
yeah

1248
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:38,480
and like I was saying too this is

1249
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,679
specifically for my grow you know um it

1250
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,079
might not happen to everybody else's

1251
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:46,399
grow if they apply it but totally it's

1252
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,400
just

1253
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:52,559
observation Matt anything you wanted to

1254
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:54,558
add Matt what we here no I think you

1255
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,000
guys all covered that part that's that's

1256
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,400
that's veg is pretty easy easy you know

1257
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,440
just just follow a standard regimen I

1258
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,400
mean I I think the only thing I'll add

1259
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:09,000
is a lot of people that I'm learning

1260
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,480
read by PPM or EC and just like one

1261
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,239
thing that they're taking into account

1262
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,838
or not taking into account is that a lot

1263
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,000
of these companies aren't very

1264
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,960
consistent with the product they're

1265
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,519
delivering like it's not homogeneous

1266
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,000
just because it says guaranteed analysis

1267
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:21,838
doesn't mean that there is a guaranteed

1268
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,358
analysis of your bottle and I learned

1269
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:24,679
that myself when I was working with my

1270
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,719
spray and trying to figuring out how to

1271
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:28,000
register it and people are just like oh

1272
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,598
yeah you can put whatever you want on it

1273
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,519
bro you can you know get learning that

1274
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:35,359
like illuminated a lot for me so that's

1275
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:37,759
when I started using um very consistent

1276
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,920
suppliers of uh stuff and for a while

1277
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,359
House and Garden even um kind of went

1278
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,798
down on their nitrogen uh for a while

1279
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:45,440
like they just it totally dropped out of

1280
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:47,119
their bottles so that's when I switched

1281
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,240
to Canon for a while but uh house and

1282
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,798
Gardens bounced back pretty well I must

1283
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,118
say so I like both of those and they

1284
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:55,440
they've been consistent enough over the

1285
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,480
years that I do know what like what I'm

1286
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,119
feeding them based on the amount of

1287
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,119
milliliters I'm putting in and I don't

1288
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,798
really have to second guess that but I

1289
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,720
think a lot of people U maybe don't have

1290
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:07,280
that same luxury with the nutrients

1291
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:08,519
they're using all the time so maybe take

1292
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,839
that part into consideration a little

1293
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,280
