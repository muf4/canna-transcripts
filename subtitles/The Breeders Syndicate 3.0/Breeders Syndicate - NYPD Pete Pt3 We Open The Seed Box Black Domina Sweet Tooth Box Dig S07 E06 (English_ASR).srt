00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,000
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,519
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,740
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,539
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,759
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,138
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,060
subculture

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,618
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,778
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,820
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,339
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,079
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,759
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,018
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,840
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:36,979
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,980
to the underground

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,379
we joined this conversation already in

19
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:49,079
progress and it kind of ends abruptly

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,960
too so uh yeah

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,359
let's get to it

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,100
just keeping all right dude how you been

23
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,738
good it's a little bit earlier for you

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,320
guys there yeah yeah Antonio think he

25
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,839
just got out of the bed Matt just told

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,519
me but I've been up since six eight I

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,320
don't know what the [ __ ] deal is he's

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,580
lying he's rolled out of bed

29
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,399
um

30
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,859
yeah so um let's see

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,420
I I just hit record and I figure we're

32
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,099
just gonna have a conversation and just

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,140
like go through seeds and just see where

34
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,298
it leads us on conversations

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,799
yeah okay yeah and I I kind of split the

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,740
seeds while you can record are you

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,180
recording now yeah okay so I did

38
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,560
um did you want to do your intro thing

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,240
or nah it's okay so uh I did kind of go

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,759
through the seeds and I figured there

41
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,560
was certain ones you might be interested

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,599
in there's certain ones you probably

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,460
don't really care much about they were

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,798
again

45
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:48,000
I never classed my classified myself as

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,180
a breeder I was a seed maker yeah not a

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,739
thing right except for a couple little

48
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,600
projects I did for myself where I was

49
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,640
looking for

50
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,539
certain characteristics

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,579
for myself and for my crew sure and then

52
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,159
also in turn for

53
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:08,399
um the general public because I honestly

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,679
think they would benefit from what I was

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,280
chasing sure but a lot of the genetics

56
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,620
even the stuff I found is just you know

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,900
somebody who's in Amsterdam they they

58
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,080
brought back yeah a few packs of this a

59
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,439
few packs of that we grew them out uh

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,120
crossbred put f1s out on the market for

61
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,919
I think it was six seeds I sent you some

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,140
of those catalogs yeah yeah yeah dude

63
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,119
those are also 16 or 25 bucks or

64
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:34,859
something like that yeah right just to

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,000
kind of and I'll send you some more

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,819
stuff like

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,360
Chris who was the founder of the great

68
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:44,818
canana he Emporium and um hemp Nation so

69
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,280
uh getting one of the earlier I'm gonna

70
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,679
I go out there and say well I think

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,959
you're the first seed bank in Canada

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:57,360
that openly sold seeds on the uh uh on

73
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,060
the market yeah uh even though it was

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,780
just through retail and uh

75
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,400
um

76
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,759
our website or his website yeah and uh

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,800
it was you know we're gonna go back to

78
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,439
like

79
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,819
95. everything had to be we didn't have

80
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,900
any kind of this Wicks or whatever

81
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,719
everything he was doing the entire

82
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,158
website through raw code okay yeah I

83
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,739
remember doing that yeah it was quite

84
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,919
the process to uh do this so it was uh

85
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:29,459
it's pretty nice to uh you know 95s

86
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,139
early 95 is early for HDM and you know

87
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,000
and this again this is going to bring up

88
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,639
what we spoke about the very first time

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,699
we spoke because I called my black

90
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,458
dominant 95 my Widow 98.

91
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,500
uh that's right and then we started do

92
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,259
looking into it with Shawnee kids and he

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,658
was just like nah Dominic didn't come

94
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,298
out till 96.

95
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:53,219
so I was like that's [ __ ] up that I

96
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,640
would mislabel that because I literally

97
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,560
been calling that since 95. yeah and uh

98
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,479
so I talked to Chris about it and I was

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,658
like this is a seed catalog that I

100
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,439
remember it in what was on the cover

101
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:06,359
um

102
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:10,139
and we were able to pull out one of the

103
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,560
old hemp Nation uh seed menus yeah and

104
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:18,180
there's black domino and it was in this

105
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,220
was from May of 96. yep so which means I

106
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,680
would have bought those seeds and

107
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,160
sprouted them most likely in late 95

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,699
yeah in order to uh grow them out enough

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,439
to to reproduce them to reproduce you

110
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,939
know what would hot what would happen

111
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,819
often is they would release new lines in

112
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:42,418
and around the Cannabis Cup right which

113
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:45,599
was back then in you know the last week

114
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:47,099
of November yeah November yeah so like

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
there could be a thing where you're like

116
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:54,060
oh it's you know it I got it in 95 right

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,639
right but it was released on November

118
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,620
27th

119
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,680
1995. so it literally came out like a

120
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,139
month before the you know this was in

121
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,478
the 95 catalog yeah yeah that's what

122
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:11,460
we've when we found the catalog it said

123
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,959
95. so the website says 96. so then I

124
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,959
was thinking about that also because

125
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,839
most of the people traveling from here

126
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,339
to Amsterdam were going for the cup yeah

127
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,859
so

128
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,359
that's when they're buying all the seed

129
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,379
so they would have brought the seed back

130
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,259
to us in like you say early December uh

131
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,000
95. yeah yeah I mean like in the Jack

132
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,639
Herer for instance I mean obviously like

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,579
95 they had that whole themed cup based

134
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,879
on him yeah um they did the worldwide

135
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,659
release of the Jack Herrera line at the

136
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,159
cup

137
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,900
right so it was it was one of those

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,880
times like for the Dutch or whatever

139
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,279
where you could get a lot of free

140
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:54,680
publicity there was already all the

141
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:57,478
cameramen you know and all the ad guys

142
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,139
we're already there so you'd get a lot

143
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,758
of free press on the new new right so I

144
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,620
kind of viewed it as like that was at

145
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,660
least on the in the 90s era it was

146
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,459
pretty traditional for them

147
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,979
you know and then on top of that too

148
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,599
maybe they had a line that was like that

149
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:14,758
was about to come out but they'd enter

150
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,320
it into the cup and then it would win

151
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,660
something and then the seeds would be

152
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,719
immediately available right and you'd

153
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,720
see those like super glossy multi-page

154
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,240
Center folds and High Times right and it

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,940
was all about driving interest right and

156
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,860
it was a business and stuff and you know

157
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,719
it kind of this kind of brings me to my

158
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,038
my other topic before we really get into

159
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,780
the uh the bag of beans here is you know

160
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,959
um I was talking with Matt too like I

161
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,599
had some some friends reach out and kind

162
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,120
of question some of the things that I

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
was the way I was remembering them and

164
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,918
then so it got me thinking about that

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,560
the bd95 I was like I swear it's 95 and

166
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,719
it took me months you know well yeah for

167
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,418
for Chris to dig out some of her old

168
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,060
hemnation stuff to see well no here's

169
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:05,579
the BD on that right so and what I was

170
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,939
trying to explain to you know uh people

171
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:12,418
that have have questions about how some

172
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,879
of us recall certain stories or certain

173
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:16,680
events and I think not so you talked

174
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,199
about this a few times in the past where

175
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,639
a lot of people were like secretive and

176
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,740
they didn't want to share the stories

177
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,598
right and then there was people like me

178
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,220
that wanted to share the stories don't

179
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,439
mind sharing the stories

180
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,380
and if somebody

181
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,060
remembers it differently then at least

182
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,300
here we're giving them a platform we're

183
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,538
giving I'm trying to invoke the

184
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,860
conversation you know don't text me on

185
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,620
my cell phone and say Hey listen what

186
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,300
you said was wrong right and if if

187
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,399
that's the case then correct me and I'll

188
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,439
come online or whenever I talk to

189
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,019
anybody in newspaper magazine whatever

190
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,240
I'll correct it kind of thing but I can

191
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,098
only regurgitate how I remember things

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,960
and I don't you know if I mispronounce

193
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,060
somebody's name or I have a date wrong

194
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,560
or you know

195
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,598
like the story that we were talking

196
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,300
about last time with the seeds that we

197
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,918
used in Switzerland yeah this is a story

198
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,560
so that's why I was asking if you guys

199
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,538
know anybody that was working with

200
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,439
Neville back then that could collaborate

201
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:19,199
or confirm that uh that story be great

202
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,660
because this is what I've heard and you

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,538
know what if I misspeak or something

204
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,520
like that there's when you air this

205
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,878
there's a whole bunch of comments people

206
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,859
can comment correct us so we know that

207
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,979
exactly you can change certain things

208
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,300
don't get upset you know I mean it did

209
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,800
you know I didn't have a riff uh for

210
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,399
um get established because of this but

211
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:48,359
it did bring up some you know

212
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,220
um conversation sure you know they got a

213
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,659
heated conversation but it got like oh

214
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,459
no that's not how it happened well don't

215
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:56,399
tell me how you remember it I'll tell

216
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,899
you how I remember it and we can get it

217
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,700
to figure it out already out there kind

218
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,100
of Matt Matt and I deal with this all

219
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,399
the time and it is a good it is a good

220
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,459
time to chat about it because we're

221
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,080
always open to like someone remembering

222
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,539
something different or new information

223
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,700
it comes to light most of the time we

224
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,939
talk it's more like this is the best

225
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,720
that we know right now right right and

226
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,720
memories are

227
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:31,439
yeah memories memories are funny things

228
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,719
you know and we'd like to say that

229
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,820
memories are etched in stone and stuff

230
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,560
like that but you know like they're just

231
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,360
not right and then you start thinking

232
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,299
back to like

233
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,360
um 25 30 years ago or you know even 20

234
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,799
years ago or whatever and you know what

235
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,259
what's real

236
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,000
right and and that and that that's

237
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,399
definitely part of it because I mean we

238
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,339
have there's certain stories where it's

239
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,620
like people get all upset about you know

240
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,240
one camp or another but the fact of the

241
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,700
matter is is there was two or three guys

242
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,339
there and they don't agree on all parts

243
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,320
right so if they don't agree on all

244
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,080
parts and they were indisputably the

245
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,200
people involved yeah how does the rest

246
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,800
of you figure out which which tale you

247
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,140
want to believe right right

248
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:21,059
it festers in us like you know the story

249
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:23,100
and I've regurgitated stories numerous

250
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,599
times hence why I wrote a book because I

251
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,459
put it out there

252
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,379
so if somebody does remember something

253
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,539
different like you know sorry it's in

254
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,740
print now but yeah I've had this

255
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:35,759
conversation

256
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,580
for 20 30 years uh prior to and this is

257
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,039
how it's always been told kind of thing

258
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,139
and uh you know

259
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,299
I I put it as especially with cannabis

260
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,039
because listen when we get super high

261
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,899
and we have conversations or events

262
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,019
happen sometimes we might not remember

263
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,578
them that well period let alone

264
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,899
correctly

265
00:10:53,578 --> 00:11:00,359
but uh you know we look at our elders

266
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,360
elders that before the internet before

267
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,300
newspapers before you know magazines

268
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,278
before we would you know there was this

269
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,799
elder sitting in circles when I did went

270
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,799
to rainbow gatherings with the uh the

271
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,620
camp we stayed with was granola Funk and

272
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,539
they would set up a stage and it's the

273
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,940
rainbow gathering there's no newspapers

274
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:22,740
going around it was if you wanted to

275
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,680
learn the history of the rainbow Trail

276
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,120
you go to granola Funk every night at

277
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,159
six o'clock or eight o'clock and

278
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,578
there'll be a stage set up which was

279
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,439
built from you know uh logs we find on

280
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:37,319
the trees we find on the ground

281
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,420
and uh the elders would tell the story

282
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,100
yeah and that's all that we have so with

283
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,039
cannabis because it was so secretive

284
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,000
because of the laws being so

285
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:49,559
um

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,559
uh part of who said what yeah it became

287
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:54,599
secretive and the stories do get muffled

288
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:59,099
and the stories do get

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:03,540
um uh jumbled so again I invite people

290
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,120
to post stuff if they hear something UI

291
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:09,299
or somebody else says even if it's at

292
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,159
another podcast or you read it in a a

293
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,859
magazine article

294
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,958
if you have two cents add it because

295
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,539
absolutely everybody's two cents will

296
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,819
add up to a dollar someday yeah I mean

297
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,879
for sure we kind of look at it too like

298
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,320
uh you know that whole vibe that you

299
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,439
just that you were just you know

300
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,899
speaking of is kind of the way we look

301
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,300
at things yeah where like it's basically

302
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,759
just like it's like a lot of these chats

303
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:38,759
and stuff are conversation starters and

304
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,100
we absolutely welcome like more info or

305
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,500
differing points of view or tidbits that

306
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,220
get added that like ad that get weaved

307
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,320
in

308
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,300
I find that like the people that get

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,519
really Huffy about it

310
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,719
um generally are the ones where like

311
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,039
they're making money off their

312
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,440
reputation

313
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,899
or they're selling seeds or they get

314
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,320
locked into one particular historical

315
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:03,958
tale right that suits them and then they

316
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,820
end up having to defend that one right

317
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,338
and I think it's you know I think

318
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,778
there's a lot of damage done in this

319
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,139
industry because like you're saying when

320
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,399
it comes business you know and business

321
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:18,299
interferes with friendships which has

322
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,759
happened numerous times in this um in

323
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:23,699
this the movement again that got

324
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,220
developed by the industry I have some

325
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,399
really close friends that were part of

326
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,700
the very beginning of this that do speak

327
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:36,360
out when the the right time comes right

328
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,278
but a lot of them are just you know a

329
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,220
lot of them

330

353
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,980
it should be in and because some of

354
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,440
these people are old deep friends of

355
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,959
mine I invite that I would love for them

356
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,019
to come together even though I know some

357
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:49,078
of them can't because of outside of this

358
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,139
uh the Cannabis Community yeah

359
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,479
that that that weld will never will

360
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:58,019
never happen but

361
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,539
um we need to kind of keep this these

362
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:04,259
stories this journey alive and the only

363
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:06,059
way we can do it is if the elders

364
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,480
regurgitate how they understand it

365
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:12,059
exactly there's there's a lot of Elders

366
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,639

384
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,899
websites there's so much out there that

385
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:00,659
we could you know fill in all these

386
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,159
blanks and yeah maybe I am wrong in some

387
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,778
of the the stories because this is but

388
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,480
this is how I remember it and please

389
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:09,059
correct me if uh if I'm misunderstanding

390
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,820
the the at least you have the balls to

391
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,319
be wrong and to stand up and like you

392
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,639
know remember something wrong and then

393
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,139
take accountability a lot of people

394
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,680
don't even have the balls to do that and

395
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,659
they just like to point and just I wish

396
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,059
they would stand up too it's not really

397
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:26,100
my end of things but Matt Matt loves

398
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,078
like like murder shows and Murder

399
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,699
Mysteries and all that type of stuff and

400
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,219
one of the things that they've

401
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,259
discovered is one of the absolute worst

402
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,620
kinds of testimony is eyewitness

403
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,399
testimony right because the memory is so

404
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,740
funny

405
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,839
and it can and it can change over time

406
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,940
and it can be influenced over time and

407
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,339
you can be convinced and have your

408
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,959
memory change and the other part of it

409
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,779
that's important for people to realize

410
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,979
is that you know when you know this

411
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,778
might sound a little grandiose or

412
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,759
whatever but if you're involved in any

413
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,778
kind of like interesting thing in

414
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,940
history

415
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:02,939
most people don't realize they're

416
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,338
involved in it at the time

417
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,959
right like nobody we didn't realize when

418
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:08,279
we were all younger messing around with

419
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,279
this stuff that people were going to

420
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:14,039
want to know granular details right of

421
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,899
some of these things right you know and

422
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,659
that that plays a role too it's not like

423
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:22,559
we all knew that hey we should really

424
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,058
document this as we're going in fact as

425
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,338
you were saying with the with the

426
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:29,700
underground nature of things you know

427
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:32,220
notes were a bust yeah yeah exactly yeah

428
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,319
he went opposite and you kept a million

429
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,240
pictures

430
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:39,480
I always kept notes and I recorded

431
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,279
things so if I was involved there was

432
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,099
really good notes if I wasn't involved

433
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,319
and I it's just I'm going by uh what

434
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:50,399
I've seen and what I've heard

435
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:52,918
then you know what it's it's part of uh

436
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,538
part of law like if you you wanna you

437
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:58,080
know you wanna ice the goalie kind of

438
00:17:54,538 --> 00:18:00,779
thing where you want to prolong how long

439
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,960
till you put a witness on the stand

440
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,879
if you're the defense yeah because you

441
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,798
want that person's memory to get foggy

442
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:12,299
you want that in person's memory to

443
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:15,119
maybe be influenced by other things or

444
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:17,639
you know remember the gist of the story

445
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,439
but maybe not the details and like you

446
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,840
say like all these stories we have are

447
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,259
little grains and for the longest time

448
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:28,500
we were playing in a small sandbox

449
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:30,720
yeah now we're on we're on beaches of

450
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,940
endless grains of sand where there's so

451
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,819
much more out there and there's so many

452
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,080
people involved that you know the few of

453
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,599
us that were sitting in that little

454
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:42,000
sandbox we only remember so much and

455
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,699
we're going back to the uh for me the

456
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,798
80s I started growing pot in the mid 80s

457
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,298
I talk about that too all the time where

458
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,480
it was like I kind of feel like at least

459
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:54,839
for like America for for a while there

460
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:58,380
like hippies and the Grateful Dead and

461
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:01,859
that kind of Highway it was the the

462
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,559
primary path in cannabis yeah oh yeah

463
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:07,259
there's not any it's not anymore but for

464
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,079
an era there you know like you know

465
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,819
hippie circles and groups of friends and

466
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,279
and all and then on top of that people

467
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:17,759
don't realize that like you could go

468
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,500
meet somebody on dead tour and chat and

469
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,779
you were somewhat anonymous because they

470
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,279
didn't know where you lived yeah they

471
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,779
didn't know who you were really they

472
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,759
weren't from your hometown you weren't

473
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:28,798
going to get ray aided necessarily and

474
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,440
so you know people would bring their

475
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,538
weed on the on the tour and stuff and so

476
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,340
like there there's you know now it's

477
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:37,140
like you as you were saying like weed's

478
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:39,240
a super highway and like that's just one

479
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,700
lane yeah you know there's a bunch of

480
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,679
other lanes now and with the Grateful

481
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,620
Dead thing too like the the Shakedown

482
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,019
Street was where the stories that's

483
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,178
where the elders sat and told the story

484
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,220
to the Next Generation but there was a

485
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,440
lot of us out there now I wasn't on dead

486
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,279
tour but you know obviously lots of uh

487
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,840
good friends Not only would I when I did

488
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,240
my travels

489
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,798
up and down the East Coast I didn't just

490
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,440
bring the pot I brought the seed too

491
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:10,139
because for me

492
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,058
I like this this type of cannabis right

493
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,799
and I and this seed grows this type of

494
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:17,279
cannabis well Crossing International

495
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:19,619
lines or on dead tour

496
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,599
chances of DEA or anybody like that

497
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,279
infiltrating Shakedown or something like

498
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,019
that you don't want to travel with

499
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,700
[ __ ] large amounts of pox so when you

500
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,460
you find somebody that's like-minded

501
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,038
that has good pot and has the right Vibe

502
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,500
or the right stories you pass that seat

503
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,599
along to that person and say Hey listen

504
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,298
when we're dead comes through here next

505
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:41,339
year I'm gonna call you up or I'm gonna

506
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,779
you we're gonna find each other you know

507
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:45,119
bring me some of this

508
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,038
you know and you can spread that seed

509
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,619
and give me some of your seed and if

510
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,660
when you're in Buffalo or something like

511
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:54,178
that or you're in Orlando

512
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,640
look me up I'll be around I'm gonna have

513
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,280
your seat right so we would do that not

514
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,559
only just for the story but for the for

515
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,700
the ability for us to share in genetics

516
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:04,980
but also

517
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,279
uh not you know for a safety reason

518
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,200
almost basically to you know pass out

519
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:11,639
cuttings I was I went through a phase

520
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,080
where I was like I don't want anybody to

521
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,700
really have my cuttings and stuff like

522
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,199
that I'm a little worried about it and

523
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,038
we were talking about that with the moms

524
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:23,640
I had at the end of my uh mom Garden I

525
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:27,179
was somewhere close to 150 moms yeah

526
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,620
it's a lot over at least 100 of them I

527
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,080
had for years

528
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:34,019
and I and

529
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,399
probably 30 of them I've had for

530
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,220
decades

531
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,259
yeah that I've kept and I was always

532
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,179
like yeah you know and this is something

533
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,339
else I think I sent you in a in a

534
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,500
private message was you know when I was

535
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:48,000
doing that uh I don't really want to

536
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
have anybody go I was like they're going

537
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,480
to bastrize it they're going to [ __ ] it

538
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,259
up it's going to kill the name [ __ ] like

539
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,700
that

540
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:59,460
well then my that I lost that Mom well I

541
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,200
didn't give it to anybody right so then

542
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,000
I was like okay you know what I got this

543
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,120
guy Yoda I'm going to give him my

544
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,400
genetics you know and he keeps him I

545
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:13,158
came I keep two of every [ __ ] plan

546
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:17,220
right so that means and when I have a

547
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:21,000
130 150 plants that means I have 300

548
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:23,159
moms not just flowering 300 moms yeah

549
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,500
about your numbers and [ __ ] like that

550
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,500
you know yeah that comes into play

551
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:33,480
to different people

552
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,980
and I what I did learn also is never

553
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,140
tell

554
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,200
you know grower a that you gave it to

555
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,919
grow would be as well right what's that

556
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,600
why

557
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,940
grower bees like well you gave it to

558
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,740
grower a so I just killed it I I didn't

559
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,960
have space I didn't have time and then

560
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm just totally true thrower a [ __ ]

561
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,038
just did the same [ __ ] thing and now

562
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,839
I have that [ __ ] strain and I lost

563
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,700
like I lost my chemo from 96. yeah

564
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,619
and I'm just like and I found some chemo

565
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,058
seeds

566
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:05,399
you know I don't know which ones they

567
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:07,038
are the UBC or again I think there's an

568
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,900
Ottawa cut

569
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:13,079
again called chemo was it the [ __ ]

570
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,500
chemo you know in our seed [ __ ]

571
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:21,178
catalog there's a story that chemo was

572
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:23,640
developed to fight cancer and and I

573
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,019
think they said Ontario yeah and I was

574
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,600
like where the [ __ ] that story come from

575
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:28,339
it's written in the hemp Nation [ __ ]

576
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,779
um

577
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,119
uh catalog so I was just like really

578
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:36,418
like

579
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,678
I I did hear about G13 you know I heard

580
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,900
you know there are certain medical

581
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,179
strains being grown in California that

582
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,280
made it up here and you know and then

583
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,980
the whole like M39 that whole list of

584
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,139
the M's and stuff like that like

585
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,259
there's people out there that know the

586
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,960
the truth of where this came from

587
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,240
and it could have been like my purple

588
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,880
Power Plant my purple power plant is not

589
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,859
a power plant yeah right it's purple

590
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,020
Power Plant because it was a cutting

591
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,178
given to me a guy had no idea what it

592
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,740
was old-time farmer just not smoking

593
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,320
this strain we've been growing for the

594
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,900
last [ __ ] 20 years or 10 years and I

595
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,779
grew it out it grew just like a a power

596
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,798
plant structure I was [ __ ] went

597
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:18,298
purple

598
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,339
I don't know what to call it so I call

599
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:21,779
it a triple P purple Power Plant people

600
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:23,459
like oh yeah I love power plants like

601
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:25,259
well this isn't power play like at least

602
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,840
I'll be honest about it I just named it

603
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:30,298
this because it fit the description it

604
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,058
was easy for me to uh remember was that

605
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:35,279
the PPP that went around Canada

606
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:36,779
I don't know because there was because

607
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,099
there was a PPP that went around that

608
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:39,960
people called like pure power plant

609
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:42,719
purple Power Plant

610
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,900
it might have like I did this I named

611
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,900
that

612
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,819
probably 12

613
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,799
at least 12 years ago probably more

614
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,319
maybe no it's long enough before I was

615
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,440
married so probably 15 years ago you

616
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,599
know yeah and it was just again at this

617
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,360
time again I was spreading the wealth I

618
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,279
mean you and my members all my members

619
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,038
at the London compassion Society have

620
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:14,220
access to all my genetics we don't hold

621
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:17,759
them back from them never have so if

622
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:21,179
they wanted it or they ended up with it

623
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,700
um whoever they gave it to you know good

624
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,440
on them luckily some I got some strains

625
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,419
back that way I was like ah you know we

626
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,340
lost it put it on our website hey were

627
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,259
you growing this strain

628
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,418
and they say I wasn't but I gave it to

629
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:36,000
my brother-in-law I can ask him he still

630
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,820
has it get it back to us kind of that's

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,119
awesome you know the whole thing about

632
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:44,579
keeping our seeds protected and you know

633
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,079
um and like again when we get into the

634
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,579
seeds here which we probably should soon

635
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,759
is

636
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:54,418
um I want I you know it's going to piss

637
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,038
people off but I want to see genetics

638
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,799
um

639
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:01,859
rescued yeah because some of these

640
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:05,158
people don't have these genetics you

641
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:07,319
know yeah I mean as a collector myself

642
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,260
like the hardest thing it's really easy

643
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:12,000
to spread things out when like they're

644
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:13,919
having their moment in the Sun and

645
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,440
they're popular and people can make

646
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,059
money off them the hard part is like hey

647
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,220
I'm gonna give you this hold on to it

648
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:22,619
keep it in your mom room even when it's

649
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,778
unpopular and it's maybe just head stash

650
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:26,639
for you and nobody else wants it right

651
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:28,980
because everybody wants it when it's

652
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,600
heads has its moment in the Sun and it's

653
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,640
popular and they can sell it and they

654
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,439
can do stuff with it but it's like who's

655
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,360
gonna hold on to it when it's just

656
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,240
unpopular and kind of a pain in the ass

657
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:41,038
and taking up space right and so that's

658
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,919
the weird thing is everybody wants

659
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:46,679
someone else to do that work right so

660
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,080
that it's available to them when they

661
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,278
want it right see I did it I had to do

662
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,038
it a little bit different again because

663
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,720
of the amount of clients that we had

664
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:55,859
um I would sit with my staff and say

665
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,519
Okay

666
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:01,918
um this is what's in the garden now this

667
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,079
is what's uh coming next and this is

668
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,880
what's after that and we would have to

669
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,038
figure out okay well this strain is one

670
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,440
of the popular sellers we want to grow

671
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:12,839
it every other Harvest or every third

672
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,519
Harvest depending on how many uh lights

673
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,379
we were going to dedicate to it but we

674
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,000
would have to you know especially with

675
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,600
you know

676
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,519
I think we have we keep at least 25 to

677
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:27,119
30 strains on our menu

678
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:29,400
and we produce all of them right so we

679
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,199
would have to predict when that strain

680
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,080
we think is going to get down low enough

681
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,840
that we never run out of it so I would

682
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,778
have to predict I had literally almost

683
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,399
two years of

684
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:43,679
um

685
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,380
of a list of what I was going to be

686
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,179
growing because I had to

687
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,179
so we didn't run out of it on our menu

688
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:54,360
so I did keep all those strains and then

689
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,380
again it's not like I'm you it's not

690
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,119
like okay we're gonna go over that

691
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,159
strain I couldn't just say I'm going to

692
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,339
grow a strain I have to pull out the mom

693
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,260
or moms get that big enough

694
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:06,240
to take the cuttings off of them and

695
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:09,359
have the cuttings ready for when the

696
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,759
time comes to flower room so I can have

697
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,798
the Harvest in by this particular date

698
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,579
which is four and a half from now so

699
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:20,400
that means in about a year or in six in

700
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:22,259
14 months I have to start the taking the

701
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,778
cuttings out of the mom room put them

702
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:26,339
into the veg or you know it's actually

703
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:28,859
one of the big problems that we have

704
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:31,099
right now in like what and like how they

705
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:35,099
arrange to like California legal market

706
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:37,259
right that you most people like you know

707
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,599
the nursery and the cultivation for

708
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,038
flower is separate right they're

709
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,740
separate they're separate businesses

710
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:46,859
they're licenses and so like a nursery

711
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,480
might have a hundred plants you know

712
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,699
that they're that they have in their in

713
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,759
their collection but they only pick

714
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,419
eight or nine to like have that many

715
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:59,220
moms to offer up that season right right

716
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,840
and so it's like actually like quite

717
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,278
limiting because they're trying to plan

718
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,038
it and like you can be like oh I want to

719
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:06,900
grow this right but man like the

720
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,679
nurseries that I want they didn't choose

721
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,840
that one right to Market this year so I

722
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:15,059
can't I can't get enough of them so

723
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,558
therefore it can't go in my garden so

724
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:19,200
therefore it's not going to hit the menu

725
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:21,058
anywhere well and that was an issue also

726
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,220
like you're saying with what's uh what's

727
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:25,139
the new phase uh the what's hot on the

728
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,940
market right now we had to keep that

729
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,980
into consideration with the center as

730
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,759
well because they're like oh well you

731
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,679
know the um the poop breath is uh is is

732
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,079
huge right now everybody's asking for it

733
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,519
say okay well you know let's see if we

734
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,259
can find a cutting okay I can get a

735
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,538
cutting but that means it's not going to

736
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,099
be on our menu for six months and is it

737
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:46,200
going to be popular by the time you Mom

738
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:49,798
it up anymore so I'm just like so for me

739
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,140
I was like what what is our staple what

740
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:55,200
do we need and I will keep a certain

741
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,100
amount of Lights available for what's

742
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,860
new

743
00:29:56,099 --> 00:30:00,778
or what you know that's going to be a

744
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,178
tester right because

745
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:04,259
we'll grow it out it's going to take you

746
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,860
know

747
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:07,319
um

748
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:10,798
minimum four months four to five months

749
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:12,720
to get a an okay Harvest where we can

750
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,639
put it out there to the to our clients

751
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,019
and then they could say yeah this is a

752
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,179
winner then we're like okay we're gonna

753
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:20,339
throw it in the next rotation

754
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,600
because we we like it it's new it's

755
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:23,579
fresh it's hot

756
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:27,359
it's going to be another three months

757
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:30,599
until we can have it um on the menu but

758
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:33,240
um and if it's not you know we have

759
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,219
another one so it was it was kind of a

760
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,019
it was a it was a quite the chess game

761
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,079
it was it was a huge pain in the ass I

762
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,859
don't miss it at all honestly but uh you

763
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:46,038
know

764
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:49,740
it was a uh it was a a hard way to

765
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:51,480
grow when it's not you're not going for

766
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,579
the magazines you're not grown for the

767
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,259
internet you're going for medicine and

768
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:57,418
you're growing and you're growing for I

769
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:59,460
think we're we're 1200 clients or

770
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:01,320
something like that luckily not all of

771
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,360
them use a use us

772
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:06,418
uh like we would like them to in I guess

773
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,819
in a sense but supplying that many uh

774
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:12,059
clients on a regular basis would be

775
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:13,798
close to Impossible yeah I bet going

776
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:19,918
into you know

777
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:22,379
um darker markets yeah so but anyways

778
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,700
um so yeah I get back to the seeds I

779
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,760
know that's what we kind of wanted to do

780
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,740
and and uh we're gonna talk on and

781
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,798
offline I think about some of this sure

782
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:35,339
this stuff because you know you we're

783
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:37,918
going to hear names that I have that the

784
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,898
original breeders of these strains are

785
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,840
definitely going to want yeah and you

786
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,278
will get yeah okay they're not going to

787
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,798
get my seed

788
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,898
but I would like to

789
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,819
see if I can resurrect these seeds if I

790
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:55,079
could save these seeds they're top on

791
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:58,798
the list they exactly will get uh

792
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,119
any of the seed if there's any males or

793
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,398
females

794
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:05,459
that I have access to that I will have

795
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:08,459
access to then the original breeders of

796
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,019
these strains get those cuts they get

797
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,278
the

798
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:18,658
um the males females and I would like to

799
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:20,159
do an open pollination just to save the

800
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:22,140
genetics I know it's going to be a

801
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,820
smorgasbord of God knows everything's in

802
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,220
there but

803
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:28,200
if there's a hundred seeds if there's a

804
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,419
thousand seeds

805
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,278
that what they're looking for is in

806
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,179
there and if it comes from any of the

807
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,579
cuts

808
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:38,778
any of the sorry the the plants male or

809
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:43,379
female that come from it 100 every uh

810
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:44,880
every breeder gets those and I'm not in

811
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,159
the same business I'm not here to sell

812
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,179
seeds I'm not here to sell their strains

813
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:54,120
I'm here to save their strains

814
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,820
um and uh I know some of them say well

815
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:58,819
just send me the original seeds well no

816
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:01,500
they're my seeds I paid for them

817
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:04,439
I want to make I want to say I want to

818
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,359
make sure they're going to who I feel is

819
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,880
capable

820
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:11,819
and because my seeds are old and they

821
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,140
weren't stored properly chances are you

822
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:14,639
know when I spoke to some of them

823
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,278
already they're like yeah don't worry

824
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,840
about the [ __ ] they're dead but some

825
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,339
of them were like oh did you storm

826
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,859
properly and I was like no not really

827
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:24,298
they're like

828
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:27,359
they're not overly interested anymore

829
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:30,179
okay and some of them

830
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,939
um as we spoke private privately are

831
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:34,679
willing to you know send people to come

832
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,140
talk to me about getting their genetics

833
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,120
back kind of thing yeah no I'm not going

834
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,700
to leave these people out they're the

835
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,859
the focus for this but yeah these are

836
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,500
seeds that

837
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:50,398
um that I own the seed I don't own The

838
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:53,099
Strain the genetic gets back to uh who

839
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,658
it rightfully belongs to uh I mean the

840
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:56,339
fun the funny part about that is some

841
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:59,399
people might not even be interested in

842
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:01,019
getting them a lot more yeah because

843
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,959
they wouldn't want to ever admit that

844
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:05,339
they needed it well some of them will

845
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,620
admit to need it but they're just like

846
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:09,299
Pete you know what that back then you

847
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:11,519
know it's nothing compared to what we're

848
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,560
producing today that's like when people

849
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,320
offer me my old stuff I'm the same way

850
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,338
I'm like well you know 15 years ago I

851
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,019
was doing something totally different

852
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:21,119
I'm really into what I'm doing now so

853
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:22,918
now go ahead and run with it yeah and uh

854
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,220
and but again I'll give them that uh

855
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,259
that offer because I was more mentioning

856
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:31,199
that like some seed banks are like oh we

857
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,260
have all the original parents yeah you

858
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:38,039
know I I know some of these guys don't

859
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:41,280
have any of these seed yeah I haven't

860
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:44,460
had for probably a decade or more

861
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,339
and it wasn't even part of their

862
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,358
breeding program as far as I know it

863
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:51,119
wasn't part of that breeding program

864
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:53,759
some of some of it was yeah something

865
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,440
that some of it wasn't and uh same thing

866
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,839
I might have 10 seeds I might have four

867
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,579
C's like the chemo I think I only have

868
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,039
like four four or five C's and little

869
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:04,799
tiny seeds kind of thing so you know

870
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,659
that doesn't belong to anybody that I

871
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,820
know of and if somebody says oh I

872
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:10,799
developed that that's mine [ __ ] hit

873
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,660
me up man if I get seeds I'll send you a

874
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,980
[ __ ] I'll send you seats I don't have

875
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,679
a [ __ ] issue with that kind of thing

876
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,838
you know you have to kind of back it up

877
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,299
a little bit but yeah you know a little

878
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:23,460
you know really strange I know who they

879
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,519
are you know yeah I thought about it too

880
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,079
because when I was starting in diva

881
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,838
and I was like listen I'm bringing all

882
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,240
my genetics and I have 15 years of data

883
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:36,599
that I've collected on the medical uses

884
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:39,179
of these strains right yeah grown in the

885
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,940
method that I grow them in and that

886
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:44,639
helps me or was planned to help me a lot

887
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,579
with getting into the legal Medical

888
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,960
Market where we can't advertise that

889
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,560
this strain works for this medical

890
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,740
condition but there's kind of a loophole

891
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:58,739
I believe that if you

892
00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:01,799
have testimony from somebody that has

893
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:04,259
the same illness or ailment as you and

894
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,180
uses this strain you know eighty percent

895
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,099
of the time they they go this is their

896
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:10,319
go-to indica and this is their go-to

897
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,338
sativa so we can give you that

898
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,960
information

899
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,659
yeah we can't say it works for your

900
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,220
condition but if I have 15 years of data

901
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,539
and I could say listen you know out of

902
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:21,239
the

903
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:25,159
um 80 clients that have the same

904
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:29,759
condition as you over the last 10 years

905
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:32,699
they 80 or 60 of the time they went to

906
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,040
this and then 20 they went to this and

907
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:37,879
then 20 they went to this so it gives

908
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:41,940
them a starting point at least

909
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,858
to have a genetic that um that works for

910
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,500
them what I'm getting to is these

911
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:48,960
genetics don't belong to me the plants

912
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,440
belong to me but the genetics don't so

913
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,420
if I bring in a genetic from you know if

914
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,858
it was some Scentsy seed or one of you

915
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,500
know the big Amsterdam companies I don't

916
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:00,480
give a [ __ ] honestly but if it's one of

917
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,219
the you know what I call the old you

918
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,039
know the from the movement in this area

919
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:07,799
in North America you know I would like

920
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,500
to reach out to that person I might not

921
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,700
ask permission

922
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:17,000
more or less saying what can I do uh to

923
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:22,139
uh

924
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,420
you know give you peace so if it is

925
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:27,598
something that you know that I'm going

926
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,039
to be using my strawberry diesel right

927
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,320
I'll reach out to Strawberry diesel guy

928
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,119
and say listen you know what I have to

929
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,760
take that's I've been growing the strain

930
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,300
for 11 years

931
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,540
um

932
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,519
we're gonna grow it in the lp Market you

933
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:43,380
know you're going to see your strain on

934
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,039
the legal Market

935
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,740
um

936
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:49,380
what can I give you be yeah kind of

937
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:50,639
thing right like if if it's a big seller

938
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,920
and we're making lots of money off it

939
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:56,400
sure fairly well because I'm the one on

940
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,838
the boat helping steer this ship you're

941
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,180
you're part of the you're one of the

942
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,578
paddlers in a sense you should get paid

943
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:05,578
I'm not [ __ ] screw anybody but I'm

944
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:07,200
also here to not here to you know bend

945
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,240
over and say listen you know yeah it's

946
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,960
your strain I won't grow it

947
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:14,819
sorry like I have it I'm I'm using it

948
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,460
for medicinal reasons it's a little bit

949
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,619
different I agree if you know I you know

950
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,619
like what buddy did to Steve in in

951
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:25,320
Amsterdam where he takes Steve's Sweet

952
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:28,019
Tooth and and enters the Cannabis Cup

953
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,180
yeah yeah you tell Steve to [ __ ] himself

954
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:33,059
pretty much right like yeah co-ops this

955
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:35,399
whole strain yeah I mean seed politics

956
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:37,679
it's it's one of those things where it's

957
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,240
you with the way seeds work and the way

958
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,279
clones and everything else work it's

959
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,979
like you can hoard it

960
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,900
or then once you let it out into the

961
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,880
into the world it's kind of the honor

962
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,579
System from then yeah yeah and like I

963
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,160
said I I've had no problem uh keeping

964
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:57,660
track of some of the people that gave me

965
00:38:53,159 --> 00:39:00,179
their these genetics you know and um

966
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:01,559
I would piece them out somehow you know

967
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:03,659
whether it be

968
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:08,820
uh like in these this case here with the

969
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:13,440
seeds if I get any uh plants from these

970
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:15,599
seeds they 100 get if they want 100 get

971
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,980
whatever they want from it they won't

972
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,980
get all of them they're not going to get

973
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,019
the exclusivity of it you know but if

974
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,760
they say well listen Pete you know I

975
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:27,119
don't really want to see my seed out

976
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,339
there being sold on on a market fine I'm

977
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,320
not here to do that I'm not I'm here to

978
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:34,078
save the genetics if they want to do it

979
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,260
great you know I think it'd be kind of

980
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,220
dumb to uh horde stuff like that

981
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,660
especially because we're talking about

982
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:43,319
strains from

983
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:45,420
15 years ago yeah you know they they

984
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,280
didn't care that much now but now they

985
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,639
think it's a money thing

986
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,680
money you know is maybe dictating with

987
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,858
some and some it's it's the respect

988
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:58,440
because they deserve so much like tons

989
00:39:55,858 --> 00:40:00,239
of [ __ ] respect in this in this uh

990
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,200
industry because they're from the

991
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,799
movement

992
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:07,319
and they kind of got you know

993
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,240
left on the Wayside whether it be their

994
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,820
fault or not their fault right like a

995
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,939
lot of us tried to get in and just tied

996
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,099
our our uh a line to the wrong boat and

997
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,139
that boat sank or went [ __ ] South

998
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:21,780
like they did within Diva you know I

999
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:26,039
gave [ __ ] my uh my name luckily not

1000
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:28,859
my genetics to a diva and um once they

1001
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,300
raised their [ __ ] 45 million dollars

1002
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:31,259
they were like yeah we don't really need

1003
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,619
you anymore

1004
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:37,440
yeah and uh [ __ ] kicked me off the

1005
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:40,260
boat kind of thing I saw that happen so

1006
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,240
often yes so many good people there's so

1007
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,380
many good people and it deserves so much

1008
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,059
better well you see in California

1009
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,099
California's getting killed right now

1010
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,239
yeah that's happened everywhere it's

1011
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,400
happened in college it's happened

1012
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,019
basically in almost every legal yeah I

1013
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,760

[ __ ] huge it's going to be [ __ ]

1018
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:07,200
Mass money you know and you get you know

1019
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:10,139
you get the uh uh the [ __ ]

1020
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,578
um up in Canada we had canopy

1021
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:15,420
um that was going around bullying and

1022
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:17,400
pushing around everybody it was a big um

1023
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,838
one out of the states I think they might

1024
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,559
have started

1025
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:25,259
Colorado or California and they opened

1026
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,639
up a shop in New York just waiting for

1027
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,280
the license but they had enough money

1028
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,139
they couldn't sell pot pure relief maybe

1029
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,180
or uh

1030
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:35,879
it's a really common one acreage

1031
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:38,519
Holdings perhaps no they're old one of

1032
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,680
those big devils yeah it was uh yeah

1033
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,380
I'll try to remember who it was but I

1034
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:45,960
know they had uh

1035
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,039
um like a flagship in New York in

1036
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,039
Manhattan

1037
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,858
ready to get a license and then before

1038
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:55,619
New York was even talking about what

1039
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:58,319
would you need to get a license and they

1040
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,380
went in and uh

1041
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,059
um opened up shop selling

1042
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,000
[ __ ]

1043
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:07,078
uh t-shirts and hats I think right like

1044
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,239
I don't know what else they could have

1045
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,859
sold at that time I'm going to try to

1046
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:12,299
Google at the same time that I talk to

1047
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:13,920
you guys but

1048
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,019
um if we start getting into the politics

1049
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,780
of how it goes state by state we'll

1050
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:21,000
really get off subject no it would I and

1051
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,619
I know like when I was uh out in

1052
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,079
Colorado

1053
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:27,300
right after they legalized

1054
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,280
and uh back then obviously they couldn't

1055
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,519
use Banks right so everybody was getting

1056
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,920
paid like their CEO that we met with and

1057
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:39,000
she helped actually write a lot of the

1058
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,700
uh the bills for other states because

1059
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,199
everybody's trying to follow in Colorado

1060
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:46,199
yeah in their footsteps kind of thing

1061
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,578
and uh she would get paid in the checks

1062
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:49,259
you have to go to a cash check in place

1063
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,839
she's probably making

1064
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,660
a couple hundred grand a year and go

1065
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,338
into it check cashing Cash in place to

1066
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:59,279
cash your check because you can't bring

1067
00:42:56,338 --> 00:43:01,139
it to a bank yeah you know like no

1068
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,060
federally insured place you know or

1069
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:05,460
trying to get paid cash a couple hundred

1070
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:07,739
grand a year in cash and you're a CEO

1071
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,119
you're not a [ __ ] hot head you're

1072
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:12,059
[ __ ] you're brought in for your

1073
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,700
business uh mine not for your cannabis

1074
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:16,799
mind that kind of thing so it's still a

1075
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:18,899
big issue in America oh yeah without a

1076
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,460
doubt without a doubt I mean that's

1077
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,680
going to be the biggest thing like our

1078
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,900
biggest LP up here being canopy which

1079
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:27,480
was uh

1080
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,639
um Tweed Stardust we announced at canopy

1081
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,380
growth there was rumor that they were

1082
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:33,000
going to think or we're thinking about

1083
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,039
starting their own bank

1084
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,280
because they

1085
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:40,679
had they were worth hundreds of millions

1086
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,880
of dollars if not you know half a

1087
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:45,358
billion dollars

1088
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,980
and other companies like in Diva we're

1089
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:50,219
getting kicked out of banks

1090
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,838
yeah right we had you know millions of

1091
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:53,759
dollars in their in there and they're

1092
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,159
like yeah you know what come and get it

1093
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,579
we don't we won't I got kicked out of

1094
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:02,159
I've been kicked out of three Banks now

1095
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:06,480
in uh in Canada you know I've been

1096
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:09,598
denied uh mortgages when I put up three

1097
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,420
times what the mortgage was for in in

1098
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,039
assets but because of what I did for a

1099
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,460
living even though it was fully legal

1100
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:19,500
and it was a publicly traded company

1101
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,260
the bank wouldn't touch me yeah because

1102
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,599
you know uh reputational risk

1103
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:27,000
kind of [ __ ] so anyways I know we're

1104
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,140
getting way off topic so

1105
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,760
um

1106
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:33,900
what do you want to start with

1107
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,480
uh just wherever you grab well

1108
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:39,420
there's gonna be

1109
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,199
sorry there's gonna be

1110
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:45,599
stuff that I think is interesting to me

1111
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,679
and then there's going to be the stuff

1112
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,680
that

1113
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,679
um

1114
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,519
um might be interesting to some I know

1115
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,660
this okay so this came up it's gonna be

1116
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,960
kind of hard I don't know if you can see

1117
00:44:54,659 --> 00:45:02,639
the names it's kind of hard to see the

1118
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,220
name so cream sortica oh cool right so

1119
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:08,879
that's interesting this is a seed that

1120
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:10,699
we did in Switzerland okay I think Steve

1121
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,599
brought it in from

1122
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:16,578
this

1123
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:19,140
guy and now this guy's name was

1124
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:20,400
uh start with a j his name is Jay he's

1125
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:22,618
the douchebag I was talking he lives on

1126
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,119
Sunshine Coast now uh but I don't think

1127
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:27,358
it came from him but it came through a

1128
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:30,000
mutual friend whose name is a color and

1129
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:32,519
it's the red color but

1130
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,440
um I think that's where this seed came

1131
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:37,079
from

1132
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,220
I don't know if I brought these back I

1133
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,260
didn't bring these back from Switzerland

1134
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:43,199
I think I I ended up maybe getting these

1135
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:47,400
after Switzerland I ended up uh working

1136
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:50,460
on a greenhouse Farm in the interior

1137
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,920
um north of Kamloops that

1138
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,858
the guy that was growing the

1139
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,760
cream soda cup most likely gave me these

1140
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:58,440
beans

1141
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,060
kind of thing and they look good but

1142
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,260
this is this might be a strain that

1143
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:06,539
could be of interest to some sure not to

1144
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,460
the because I wouldn't know you I I

1145
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:10,440
wouldn't even give it the guy that would

1146
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,480
have made these seeds yeah yeah didn't

1147
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,300
give a [ __ ] about them and I really

1148
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,579
don't give a [ __ ] about him

1149
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,560
um so yeah I'd be into that one that's

1150
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:21,660
cool yeah and again like I said we'll

1151
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:22,858
figure out a whole bunch of that so so

1152
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:25,379
now

1153
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:28,500
we were talking about Mighty Mite yeah

1154
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:30,240
right yeah and uh so these seeds here

1155
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,338
from

1156
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:36,059
uh

1157
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:37,519
from May 2002 they're a Hindu Kush cross

1158
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,920
Mighty might

1159
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:42,539
being in Southwestern Ontario where like

1160
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,019
you were saying we need to get our stuff

1161
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:47,460
in out of the fields

1162
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:49,858
mid-september if possible right yeah

1163
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,980
yeah because of the the cold the frost

1164
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:55,980
and stuff like that uh we we were and

1165
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,420
this is from Yoda uh who's still like

1166
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:01,679
I've mentioned before so I'm gonna give

1167
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:04,380
some of my genetics too to hold yeah um

1168
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,179
this is his breathing now his breeding

1169
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,099
wasn't super specific or anything he was

1170
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:09,659
just like you know I got a Mighty Mite

1171
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:12,000
I'm gonna cross it with a whole bunch of

1172
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:14,578
[ __ ] because I want to speed up now

1173
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,119
Crossing with the Kush the Hindu Kush

1174
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:21,240
which is also a fairly fast train faster

1175
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:23,099
strain it was making uh and this is

1176
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:26,219
going O2 we didn't have the Kush craze

1177
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,780
by that time yeah no maybe for a second

1178
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,519
you could talk about Mighty might

1179
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,859
because while Matt and I might be real

1180
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,019
familiar with it yeah most people

1181
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:36,539
especially in the US and stuff it

1182
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:38,818
probably predates them and they probably

1183
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:41,219
have maybe heard about it but don't know

1184
00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:44,279
very much about why it was popular or

1185
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:46,139
why it became such a Canadian thing yeah

1186
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,599
I think I think it's basically what I

1187
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:51,420
was just saying too is because these

1188
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:53,338
strains that were fast you know and we

1189
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:57,300
didn't want the [ __ ] ruderalis crap

1190
00:47:53,338 --> 00:48:00,119
right because it was crap but the uh the

1191
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,700
fact that you know could clone it you

1192
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:05,099
know with Mighty might uh it was a very

1193
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:08,159
easily clonable plant it because of its

1194
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:10,740
structure but most importantly

1195
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:13,500
for us it's we need things that finish

1196
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:16,739
quickly and I wanted to

1197
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,199
we would use that in our um I'm going to

1198
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:21,719
say breeding but in our seed making we

1199
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,239
were looking for these

1200
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:27,118
um uh early you know ideally early

1201
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:29,399
September strength before the thieves

1202
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:33,119
get out there before the police get out

1203
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:35,519
there and before the frost comes

1204
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,740
so I mean as far as the history goes in

1205
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:40,139
Mighty might I that's I'd leave that a

1206
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:42,179
little bit more to The Experts sure

1207
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:44,279
these were just but that's fine it got

1208
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:45,179
it got famous basically because it came

1209
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,519
in

1210
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:50,460
in the season that was appropriate for

1211
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,719
where you guys are at yeah 100 100 and

1212
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,119
that's the same thing with that Golden

1213
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,939
Boy right so yeah see a bunch of things

1214
00:48:54,119 --> 00:49:01,579
Golden Boy I have a string called Boris

1215
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:05,119
which was a um and I just saw that too

1216
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:05,119
AK-47 Golden Boy

1217
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:09,000
no I don't have that strain but I want

1218
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:12,480
to find out the lineage on this Golden

1219
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,579
Boy so again story I was told and I ran

1220
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,420
this by HB

1221
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:20,818
um about you know because it really that

1222
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,019
was our that worked in at M Nation we're

1223
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:24,960
pretty sure it came through one of his

1224
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:26,539
connections okay now that's when this

1225
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,980
whole triple SC

1226
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:34,199
uh name was was attached to it yeah okay

1227
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,599
but it was attached to it coming out of

1228
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:39,719
Ontario not out of Amsterdam so it was

1229
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:42,079
either he was over there and got this

1230
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:42,078
seed

1231
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:48,838
from the triple FC guys in the

1232
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,818
you know the 80s and the 90s what this

1233
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:52,519
was would have been when we got it would

1234
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:54,199
have been

1235
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:57,300
mid mid

1236
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:59,578
90s Maybe 96.

1237
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,260
I have pictures of it

1238
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,420
um

1239
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,960
and I'm gonna say mid 90s give or take a

1240
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:09,900
few years kind of thing so

1241
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:12,240
what is it I don't know but this we knew

1242
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,599
that when we did quote inside [ __ ] 45

1243
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:17,399
days you know it was uh it was finishing

1244
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,680
up so we I'd love to see some pictures

1245
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,460
of it sometime yeah it's not but they're

1246
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:22,460
not not good pictures

1247
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:30,599
really weird strain it was very [ __ ]

1248
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,639
that pistoly the gentleman that was

1249
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:34,619
growing it I think he even has tin foil

1250
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:37,199
on the walls it was going back that far

1251
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:39,539
awesome kind of thing yeah

1252
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:42,239
um it wasn't Phototron years but it was

1253
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:44,940
like the first time of HID lighting

1254
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,739
being brought into closets yeah trying

1255
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:51,059
to make it as reflective as possible

1256
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:52,858
yeah I mean my first part I was a uh was

1257
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:55,380
a gutted refrigerator

1258
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:57,900
you know that's awesome and yeah lined

1259
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,420
with tinfoil and uh

1260
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,858
um fluorescent lights yeah because we

1261
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,900
didn't have and we basically built a

1262
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:06,900
Phototron in our garage back in New York

1263
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,880
do it yeah don't do it dude and uh toast

1264
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,858
who was my roommate back then we were

1265
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,740
both [ __ ] Surfer skate or pothead

1266
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:17,098
kind of guys and uh he was the first

1267
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:21,179
person that I knew that grew uh under

1268
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:23,880
hid right so 400 watt in his closet you

1269
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:27,899
know I lived with those uh and he was

1270
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,980
using four inch Rockwell cubes in

1271
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,900
um

1272
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:34,199
in tupperware dishes

1273
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:35,579
you know under a 400 right so uh we got

1274
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:38,879
off topic again

1275
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:41,220
but um yeah so I think with the Golden

1276
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,960
Boy that's again where you we're going

1277
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:45,179
to see that name come up in my seed

1278
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,139
collection yeah because

1279
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:51,659
of the speed it up whatever I was uh

1280
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:53,338
gonna grow it with

1281
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:56,098
um

1282
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:58,799
so here like okay so we got another

1283
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:00,180
block Domino so this is a black dominant

1284
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,240
female

1285
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:06,058
and we had a sweet tooth number three

1286
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:08,459
cross blueberry male

1287
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,140
oh that sounds like that almost sounds

1288
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,639
like what

1289
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:14,098
I can't remember who was talking about

1290
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:16,799
it was describing as black or sweet

1291
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:18,619
what was it sweet tooth four some one of

1292
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,000
the weird sweets

1293
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:22,619
It's one of the sweet tooths had black

1294
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,659
domino inserted and it was like sweet

1295
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:27,180
paint grapefruit blueberry black domino

1296
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:30,058
and it was only for a brief little bit I

1297
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:32,759
don't know 2.2 or that doesn't sound

1298
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:34,859
familiar to me but again if you're

1299
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,780
trying to get into breed of Steve's head

1300
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:38,159
what he was doing what he was looking

1301
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,500
for

1302
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,838
um going back to this this would also

1303
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,940
probably be a seed that came out in the

1304
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:49,259
mid 90s or was yeah it was made in the

1305
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:50,039
mid 90s by us about me is my handwriting

1306
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:54,900
um

1307
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:58,199
and back then I was selling uh Sol seeds

1308
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:01,519
in London for Steve where you'll see

1309
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:01,519
that I have

1310
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:08,460
very very hold on a second oh well

1311
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,619
so like yeah so that's the

1312
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,659
sweet who is that sweet tooth number

1313
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:14,760
four yeah yeah

1314
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:16,679
now there's a bunch of seed there and

1315
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,559
that's the one that Gary stole from

1316
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:21,659
Barney's farm and entered in the cup is

1317
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:23,400
the Sweet Tooth number four oh really we

1318
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:25,858
went with yeah I thought it was a three

1319
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,019
really it was a four I thought he sells

1320
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:30,480
it he sells it as four so maybe it

1321
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:32,219
wasn't yeah this is this is where I was

1322
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,858
saying before so I got like a vial

1323
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:36,838
inside a vial so which don't know

1324
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:38,578
exactly what that means but this is

1325
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:42,599
where you know it'd be nice to get

1326
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:45,420
people like Steve on these forums if you

1327
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:49,400
can control his temper that um

1328
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:52,260
because he has a lot of this knowledge

1329
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,460
of you know what he was doing what he

1330
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,940
was going after because he was one of

1331
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:59,579
the first he was the first breeder

1332
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:01,858
that I became friends with he was the

1333
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:04,380
guy that was actually breeding for

1334
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:07,980
genetics not for seed production I mean

1335
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:10,079
he was reading for seeds to sell but you

1336
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:13,019
know he was actually putting the the

1337
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:16,019
time in the energy into so again any of

1338
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:19,318
these seeds that I get started

1339
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:20,880
he gets first [ __ ] dips he might come

1340
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:22,920
to me and say well Pete am I straight am

1341
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,119
I see my strain I want all of it you're

1342
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,800
not going to get all of it because I'm

1343
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,160
going to keep some for myself not to

1344
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,740
sell not to [ __ ] uh uh put it out

1345
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:33,480
there that's his their his genetics he

1346
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:36,358
can do what he wants but

1347
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,980
you know I wanna like I said earlier you

1348
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:41,098
do you keep all your genetics and your

1349
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:43,440
[ __ ] in your uh back pocket

1350
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:45,720
you [ __ ] lose your pants you lose

1351
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,280
that strength kind of thing so that's

1352
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:48,838
the funny thing too where it's like when

1353
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,160
it comes to seed breeding too it's like

1354
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:53,338
people are like I'm gonna breed and I'm

1355
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:56,338
gonna sell these things yeah but then I

1356
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:58,679
still have control or dip reading right

1357
00:54:56,338 --> 00:55:01,318
everything that happens from that point

1358
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:03,358
on I own all the males you regret the

1359
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:06,358
seed for me kind of it's almost like a

1360
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:08,219
Monsanto type of thing yeah yeah where

1361
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:10,318
you're like you don't really own any of

1362
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:12,959
it I'm gonna let you grow it and smoke

1363
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:15,960
it but it pretty much mine still even

1364
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,338
though you paid me for it right well I

1365
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,740
think that's where it kind of gets

1366
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:22,739
[ __ ] up yeah that's kind of what I was

1367
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:25,979
pointing out for sure

1368
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:27,719
okay so this is something else oh

1369
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,838
it's going to be I wish I had better

1370
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:32,879
cameras so staying on the SLO stuff

1371
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:36,779
because I did a lot you know again Steve

1372
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,280
and I uh friendship goes back quite a

1373
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,180
long time and like I said he was one of

1374
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,300
the first

1375
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:43,679
people that was a breeder yeah kind of

1376
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,339
thing

1377
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,098
um

1378
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:50,279
he would sell me his seed

1379
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:52,680
oh going this way uh so this is the

1380
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,300
what is that can you see David wait a

1381
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:57,419
second no but it's a shishka berry

1382
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,160
number three oh [ __ ] three interesting

1383
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,500
and then

1384
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:04,558
shift two

1385
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:08,699
and again in his uh packaging because he

1386
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:12,119
he was a little little vials and then

1387
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:13,519
I got shishka Berry first generation oh

1388
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:16,380
wow right

1389
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:19,318
now this is where I get confused I was

1390
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:21,780
talking to Red about it uh which can be

1391
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:26,219
a little bit of a uh

1392
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:28,559
uh sensitive topic but um it was

1393
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:30,838
I just knew there was a yellow and a red

1394
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,099
line yeah right that's as far as my

1395
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:34,139
extent went to so when I was going

1396
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:37,260
through these seeds I was just like well

1397
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:40,019
this is in Steve's writing

1398
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,240
this isn't Steve's well writing

1399
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:44,940
Packaging and then the sister Berry

1400
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,219
first generation is in my writing right

1401
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,019
so

1402
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:50,578
what's what like did he have three

1403
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:52,800
different and I think red actually even

1404
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:54,420
tried to explain it to me

1405
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,940
but uh we were talking about a few

1406
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,980
different things and again why I think

1407
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,539
you know people like red who has a lot

1408
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,480
of knowledge in

1409
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:06,800
who is really doing what yeah and his

1410
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,900
versions of it which I will strongly

1411
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:12,599
agree with

1412
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:15,720
98 of the time but like you say we I I

1413
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:18,240
100 agree with I should say that I'm 98

1414
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:21,000
agree with what I'm saying because it's

1415
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:22,919
what I how I understand it so you know

1416
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,119
when it comes to these seeds I know

1417
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,619
Steve would be like well then my season

1418
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,500
I'll learn back

1419
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,119
they are your seeds and if anything

1420
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,800
comes from them you get 100 of

1421
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,900
everything but I'm keeping some for

1422
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,180
myself because I bought these seats from

1423
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:39,660
you yeah right

1424
00:57:36,179 --> 00:57:44,338
um I I like the old stuff I don't grow

1425
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:48,239
for the [ __ ] uh highest THC or a

1426
00:57:44,338 --> 00:57:50,400
certain turf or or to sell seeds right I

1427
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,979
will make sure like that you know he

1428
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,838
doesn't want this seed sold he has the

1429
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,420
seed company he's a sea breeder you

1430
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:59,578
don't [ __ ] step on somebody's Toes

1431
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:02,760
that way yeah there is genetics you can

1432
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:05,039
have them but I want to do what I can to

1433
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,079
save him so I can uh so I have them for

1434
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,719
myself or again

1435
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:10,920
if and when the time comes there might

1436
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,578
be a time that I'm like [ __ ] it you know

1437
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,760
what

1438
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:16,740
I'm moving I'm gonna be in [ __ ] you

1439
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,920
know someplace in Europe I'm not going

1440
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:22,618
to grow anymore [ __ ] I'm deluding my

1441
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,539
seed [ __ ] catalog take everything I

1442
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:27,300
don't give a [ __ ] anymore I'm not at

1443
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:28,739
that point yet when that point comes I'm

1444
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,019
not going to say okay I'm selling my

1445
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:34,078
collection I'm going to say well I'm

1446
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:36,119
going to say I have

1447
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,460
certain people's genetics are yours kind

1448
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:39,960
of thing if you don't care then sure

1449
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,019
I'll put them out there and I'll [ __ ]

1450
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:46,260
spread the spread the wealth 100

1451
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:49,159
. but like I say I have a a sweet tooth

1452
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,160
I'll just say

1453
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,720
so sweet tooth number one oh it says

1454
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:57,000
Sweet Tooth number one or number two but

1455
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:59,639
there's only like five seeds in a little

1456
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,880
[ __ ] baggie oh interesting yeah you

1457
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:04,920
know again and that to me I just want to

1458
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,338
throw this in there before I forget yeah

1459
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:11,519
like going through like uh

1460
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:13,199
um old seed collections yeah is very

1461
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,179
much like that it's like here's some

1462
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:16,858
chicken scratch that only the guy that

1463
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:20,279
put it in there could ever decipher

1464
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:22,259
here's a weird code God he gave me this

1465
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,559
oh no you know I remember this weird

1466
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:28,920
vial right and this weird vial with this

1467
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:30,960
SK on it this means this right but if

1468
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,720
you were someone else trying to decipher

1469
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,699
some some one of your friends's seed

1470
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:37,858
collections it would almost be

1471
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:39,899
impossible yeah like you pretty much

1472
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:42,119
need them it's almost like hieroglyphics

1473
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:45,240
you would almost need them there to

1474
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:48,539
interpret it for you because if you just

1475
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:50,879
got it without any and and I even think

1476
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:52,619
I mean there was a thing where

1477
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,200
um you know Matt when you and I were

1478
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:57,180
talking about uh how we found out that

1479
00:59:55,199 --> 01:00:00,000
like you know when Neville sold his seed

1480
00:59:57,179 --> 01:00:02,159
collection to Shanti uh he got pissed at

1481
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,159
him and then just stopped explaining all

1482
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:06,480
the coats yeah yeah and I didn't know

1483
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,098
what he had and then you didn't know

1484
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,760
what he had because yeah there was all

1485
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:14,280
these weird codes I was um

1486
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,720
um I think it was it was breeder Steve

1487
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,519
that when I

1488
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:18,539
was [ __ ] like 10 years ago or

1489
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,659
something like that I was like oh I got

1490
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:23,759
these old seeds of yours I'm I haven't

1491
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:25,980
stored them properly

1492
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,460
um and he put me in touch with some guy

1493
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:32,280
on the west coast and the deal was that

1494
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:35,760
he gets to keep and do whatever he wants

1495
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:37,680
with with the seeds that he recovers and

1496
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,680
I just said well no I'm not going to do

1497
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:42,659
that like that you I understand because

1498
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:45,598
then again he was a friend of Steve's I

1499
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:47,039
would imagine but it all right for if I

1500
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,780
sent him to him

1501
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,058
he could have he could have [ __ ] me he

1502
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:54,180
could have [ __ ] Steve sure right so

1503
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:56,220
every every every embryonic rescue guy I

1504
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:58,139
have ever worked with has [ __ ] me

1505

does work I get the money and I get the

1514
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:22,139
genetics yeah that's the deal I'm on

1515
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,640
wheat deal it's a great deal for me the

1516
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,558
worst case scenario I make a bunch of

1517

1526
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,679
there's not

1527
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,440
and I did this with my when I was

1528
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:51,179
hoarding my genetics people were like oh

1529
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,240
you know I need cuttings I say okay

1530

1531
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,919
and you're gonna get LCS number 18.

1532
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,740
you're like what is it they're like I'll

1533

01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:56,760
that I can't do best of luck I don't

1585

1586
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,920
who is this so yeah so grapefruit

1587
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:03,599
see again like you were saying we get

1588
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,900
trash so what I started doing with this

1589
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:09,960
stuff is I started reaching out to

1590
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:13,139
um friends yeah okay who's this so it

1591
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,220
says grapefruit SLO probably Sweet Tooth

1592
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:17,219
um

1593
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:20,159
best of luck sorry I missed you Eric

1594
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:22,259
so this somebody that

1595
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,779
probably had bought grapefruit seeds for

1596
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,119
me yeah ended up [ __ ] growing them in

1597
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,500
his [ __ ] backyard or something and he

1598
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,380
said well this is what it could be so

1599
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:34,019
you know are they worth keeping I think

1600
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:37,079
100 because it might be that one Sweet

1601
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:38,699
Tooth [ __ ] plant in there yes he's

1602
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:40,019
been looking for it yeah you know if

1603
01:04:38,699 --> 01:04:41,279
you're gonna pop a bunch of Sweet Tooth

1604
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:44,099
you might as well pop that one with them

1605
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:47,280
and see if it's not all of it and it's

1606
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:50,280
not up to me because I remember sweet

1607
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:52,740
tooth that I grew but I don't remember

1608
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,980

1649
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:31,798
times they might just say ah [ __ ] it you

1650

1656
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:46,619
yeah well

1657
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:49,019

1658
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:52,440

1662
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:05,279
say now magic carpet by hillbilly uh

1663
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,420
Salmon Creek

1664
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,059
um

1665
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,740
his first name is Steve okay I wasn't

1666
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:12,298
going to say his name but oh yeah I

1667
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:14,838
thought you were trying to guess it I'm

1668
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:14,838
like here

1669
01:07:17,298 --> 01:07:22,019
he's public with his name he's fine okay

1670
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,599
well I don't even know where he's at

1671
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:26,099
like he's California right oh god oh I

1672
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:29,579
think he's he sounds like he's from

1673
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:33,798
Kentucky but yeah okay well I thought he

1674
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:33,798
came again rumor has it

1675
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:41,880
um that he was one of the seed providers

1676
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:46,679
of the first legal

1677
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:51,539
marijuana Garden in Canada okay that was

1678
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:53,098
in flinflan Manitoba in that old

1679
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:55,079
um mine

1680
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:57,079
right I forget Nemo I don't know why I

1681
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:01,619
forget the name of it the company but

1682
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:05,700
basically it was when Health Canada was

1683
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:08,099
trying to set up the the failure of the

1684
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:11,519
metal of the marijuana community so what

1685
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:13,140
they were doing was they had

1686
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:17,039
I just had tipped my tongue too they

1687
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:18,920
were sod growers that got the license

1688
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,079
and um

1689
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:25,140
and again that's where people know

1690
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,939
different please type in

1691
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:30,359
um

1692
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:33,298
they were only allowed to sell seeds

1693
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:35,699
that were confiscated by the RCMP

1694
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:37,439
and okay that's all they could grow

1695
01:08:35,698 --> 01:08:38,818
right so they knew where the seed was

1696
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,678
coming from it wasn't supporting the

1697
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:41,298
black market

1698
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:45,480
um

1699
01:08:41,298 --> 01:08:46,500
and the guy that was growing it

1700
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:49,738
um

1701
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:53,520
was proved some crap shitty sitting on

1702
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:55,139
his shelf for [ __ ] years and then

1703
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,420
all of a sudden the pot started getting

1704
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:59,579
better the guy had you know we saw

1705
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:01,679
pictures of the gardens phenomenal

1706
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:03,899
[ __ ] facility he had tons of money

1707
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,699
millions of dollars he was in the most

1708
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:08,639
secure it was more secure than our

1709
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:10,559
[ __ ] National mint way in and one way

1710
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,420
out and it was two kilometers below the

1711
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,580
ground right it wasn't like you could

1712
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:16,619
just [ __ ] drive a tank through his

1713
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:20,159
car yeah through his door kind of [ __ ]

1714
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:21,238
right and uh supposedly these seeds made

1715
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,939
it in

1716
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:26,099
through a back door and that's why the

1717
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:26,939
guy's pot started uh

1718
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,219
uh

1719
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:31,318
um did it revolve around harijuana

1720
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:33,899
no I don't even know what the strains

1721
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:36,000
were back then okay that was what what

1722
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:38,818
shmeep schmuck that's a good name for

1723
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,979
him was uh was most known for was the

1724
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:42,960
harijuana and train Iraq like he came

1725
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:45,000
down I know he was in the medical scene

1726
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,420
in California for a little bit and one

1727
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,420
of our friends

1728
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:56,698
again how I remember hearing that the

1729
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:59,599
genetics came from California

1730
01:09:56,698 --> 01:10:02,639
to this guy called hillbilly genetics

1731
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,340
and we're able to make their their way

1732
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:09,179
into Flint lawn kind of okay yeah that

1733
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:12,360
makes sense and you know if it was uh

1734
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:14,760
again if somebody knows this uh Steve

1735
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:17,339
guy if he's out there and uh has a

1736
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:20,340
contact to him you know please let him

1737
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:22,020
know because again those two strings

1738
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,679
that I just mentioned

1739
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:25,500
um

1740
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:27,960
you know I bought them the history if he

1741
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,100
wants them back you know

1742
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,158
um he's more than welcome to whatever

1743
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:34,320
[ __ ] seed or plant comes from these

1744
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,519
genetics right like it's it's about

1745
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:38,099
sharing

1746
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,080
for me this box of seeds I have is for

1747
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,880
sharing the genetics right so when we

1748
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,640
get into certain things like

1749
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:47,279
the berry berry right yeah yeah which is

1750
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,619
these two pictures behind me my first my

1751
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,960
first centerfold in High Times

1752
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:55,500
um I got lots of these seats I love this

1753
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,719
plant it's not stable by any stretch of

1754
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:00,960
the imagination it's not bad but I would

1755
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:03,539
say I mean it's probably like a uh

1756
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,000
probably back cross

1757
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:09,779
maybe three times two or three times so

1758
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,238
it's not bad yeah again I wasn't a

1759
01:11:09,779 --> 01:11:15,359
breeder I was a seed producer kind of

1760
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:17,039
thing so sometimes I might have a you

1761
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:20,399
know a little bit

1762
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:23,640
of a different intention and therefore I

1763
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:26,879
wasn't going crazy like some of the

1764
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:30,179
people I'm in Steve telling me that he

1765
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,520
when he chose the male this resinous

1766
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:36,779
blueberry male he was actually smoking

1767
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:39,900
male flowers or or because of the uh

1768
01:11:36,779 --> 01:11:41,759
because it was a resin producing male

1769
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:44,479
okay that's right his famous resin

1770
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,820
producing blueberry male yeah right and

1771
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:49,559
so I he was like yeah I've smoked I mean

1772
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,299
made sense like I don't know what you'd

1773
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,520
be smoking have you but whatever has

1774
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:55,739
resin on it sure you know that way

1775
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,540
you're going to get some of the

1776
01:11:55,738 --> 01:12:00,419
flavor some of the Terps are going to be

1777
01:11:57,539 --> 01:12:03,238
in that resin you know

1778
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,319
so maybe that was uh

1779
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:07,439
um

1780
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:08,698
was uh a little bit more than I was

1781
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:10,019
doing I was just saying wow this is

1782
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:11,939
[ __ ] great pot

1783
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:13,980
less [ __ ] I got a mail of it I got a

1784
01:12:11,939 --> 01:12:15,359
female of it left so I can do that I

1785
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:17,158
really like this female I'm gonna

1786
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,839
because I'm gonna grow it again I'm

1787
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:22,198
gonna try to find a male that best

1788
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:25,380
record reproduces represents the the mom

1789
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:27,779
I'm gonna cross it back again right what

1790
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:31,560
was in the berry berry no [ __ ] idea

1791
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:34,319
no idea no idea no idea I just uh it

1792
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,539
came for me when I came to me

1793
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,460
um which a lot of genetics did because

1794
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:42,198
we had a seed bank

1795
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,198
we were the only ones

1796
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:47,460
finally Canada yeah doing it right this

1797
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:49,139
is before Mark was uh dark enemy was

1798
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,980
selling anything

1799
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:52,619
um

1800
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:54,599
so it was a you know somebody came in

1801
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:56,340
and said oh look you know try this stuff

1802
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,260
it's awesome grow it out like holy [ __ ]

1803
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:00,840
is that awesome you know same with the

1804
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:02,579
force right Boris was another trade no

1805
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,100
idea where it came from again I didn't

1806
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:07,738
really care about the names names are

1807
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:12,000
the least of my concern right I was

1808
01:13:07,738 --> 01:13:14,099
worried about what It produced and for

1809
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,840
uh medicinal

1810
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:22,560
and for well for medicinal bag like I

1811
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:24,239
would say bag appeal but it had a hit

1812
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,300
um a few

1813
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:31,319
criterias for us right one we need it to

1814
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:34,140
be medicinally uh useful two we needed

1815
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:35,939
to yield so we can get people to grow it

1816
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:38,640
for us because the deal we made with all

1817
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:40,319
of our Growers is we get you a legal

1818
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,320
license to grow a certain amount of

1819
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:46,439
plants you keep fifty percent of the uh

1820
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:48,899
the Harvest to to pay for everything and

1821
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:51,719
the other 50 goes to the center yeah

1822
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:53,579
right and the client that you're growing

1823
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:55,500
for never pays a dime for [ __ ]

1824
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:58,619
anything he gets all the pop for free

1825
01:13:55,500 --> 01:14:01,260
and you get a high yielding you know

1826
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:03,359
great plant the center will take will

1827
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:06,300
will will buy all the pot

1828
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:08,819
but half of it comes to us at no cost

1829
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:11,640
yeah kind of thing right so it kind of

1830
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:15,380
it helps us pay our bills

1831
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:17,760
and and keep to be a a not

1832
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:19,920
not-for-profit Society we're not

1833
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,739
non-profit but we're registered as a

1834
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,779
not-for-profit society uh it was that

1835
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:26,698
gold that triangle that I was trying to

1836
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:29,819
create even with growth shops bringing

1837
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:32,039
in local Grow shops saying

1838
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:34,500
um if you give our medical Growers

1839
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:38,100
discounts then we'll send you all our

1840
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:39,779
medical Growers yeah and um you know the

1841
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,960
Growers if you're going to sell just to

1842
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:45,059
us you get a discount from the grow shop

1843
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,760
and we're going to pay you fair value

1844
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:50,520
and we'll take all the pot right so we

1845
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,199
made and then the the client

1846
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,080
never had to pay for pot

1847
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:58,379
yeah that is pretty red yeah right so it

1848
01:14:55,079 --> 01:15:00,479
was it was a way to kind of

1849
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,980
um

1850
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,500
kind of get

1851
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:07,139
everybody what they want and make sure

1852
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:10,079
everybody's happy because if one person

1853
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:12,719
in that uh triangle wasn't happy it

1854
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,340
falls apart yep right so make sure that

1855
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,439
everybody's happy and again that's what

1856
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,940
I'm I'm I try to do all the time and

1857
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:19,859
sometimes people get pissed off at me

1858
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:21,178
for it but you know [ __ ] them kind of

1859
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:22,039
thing welcome

1860
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:25,739
um

1861
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:28,079
okay so this says NYPD Boris but

1862
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:32,819
underneath it it's

1863
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:35,880
it says there's a DMP fillow so the

1864
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:36,779
Philo taxi are you familiar that's a I

1865
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,159
think that's I'm not sure if I'm

1866
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:40,439
pronouncing it right Philo taxi follow

1867
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:42,479
taxi yeah yeah right when relation

1868
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:45,658
leaves instead of being two brackets it

1869
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,738
has a third bracket yeah right so Theory

1870
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:48,779
being

1871
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:50,579
you're gonna get a third more pot off a

1872
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:52,559
plan if it's going to be

1873
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:54,539
triple bracket instead of a double

1874
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,280
bracket kind of thing so anytime I saw

1875
01:15:54,539 --> 01:15:58,079
that I I got excited I was like oh

1876
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:01,859
there's a file there let's

1877
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:04,738
um less save it male female just so we

1878
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:06,899
can use it to cross into some of our

1879
01:16:04,738 --> 01:16:10,500
genetics to see if we can we can

1880
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:11,819
recreate that uh that and I think it's I

1881
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,100
don't think we ever were able to

1882
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:15,899
honestly I think it was we were chasing

1883
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,280
a dream kind of thing because I don't

1884
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:19,979
know

1885
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,779
um if it's stress related or what cause

1886
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:23,579
if it was a trait or if it was stress

1887
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:25,619
related or anything I don't know what it

1888
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,600
was I I thought it was a trait but it

1889
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:32,099
was like one in

1890
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:34,620
in my experience like one in 500

1891
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:36,840
yeah probably at least one in 500 that

1892
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:37,800
you would actually see it yeah kind of

1893
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,960
thing it wasn't something that we saw

1894
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:44,210
very often so when I did see it it was

1895
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,579
fairly so like I would set these aside

1896
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:45,960
[Music]

1897
01:16:44,579 --> 01:16:49,319
um

1898
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:52,319
and it's it just says NY NYPD Boris but

1899
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:53,698
the uh DMB was

1900
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:56,039
um I don't know if I can say his name

1901
01:16:53,698 --> 01:16:58,919
he's not on the thing he's a super nice

1902
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:01,198
guy yeah something Millennium bud no his

1903
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:03,000
name is Dan Miller he's a [ __ ] oh

1904
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:04,379
okay yeah yeah that's a famous strain

1905
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,260
though Dan Miller bud

1906
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:09,900
it can't be yeah it is I've heard of it

1907
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,460
upstairs apartment kind of thing yeah no

1908
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:13,198
I it's it's definitely like an old

1909
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,939
strain list and stuff that's the only

1910
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:17,158
thing I would have heard of it yeah okay

1911
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:20,158
because this is a local kid here who I

1912
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:23,579
just ran into not that long ago I I he's

1913
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:26,639
in my book actually and uh short story

1914
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:30,600
was he was one of the Growers for the

1915
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:33,840
nation beef uh not uh LCS

1916
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,699
and he was part of the what we say the

1917
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,619
honor guard like he was Nation family

1918
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:42,658
yeah and uh he just uh he came with a

1919
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:46,619
cutting that on an ebb and flow table

1920
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:50,158
just produced these big fat massive CR

1921
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:51,960
encrusted uh colas is it so perfect sea

1922
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,519
of green perfect for the you know the

1923
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,340
the

1924
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,380
um the gorilla back you know basement

1925
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:01,800
Gardens that are all running ebb and

1926
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:05,460
flow you know short sea of green type of

1927
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:07,020
plants yeah and uh so we we just started

1928
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,219
calling it The DMB because we named it

1929
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,080
after him because he didn't know what it

1930
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:12,300
was it was um a cutting that came from

1931
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:15,179
him so when we saw it and I was like

1932
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:17,579
well that's what we need for

1933
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:20,940
um our

1934
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:24,960
um you know a black market our Gardens

1935
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:27,178
that we were trying to get uh as much

1936
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,739
out of as little spot as possible kind

1937
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:30,239
of doing the sea of green kind of thing

1938
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:34,079
not worried about plant counts and [ __ ]

1939
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:36,899
like that and DMB was was a strain right

1940
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:39,000
even when I was growing one of my one of

1941
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:40,079
my rooms which was just a bedroom in one

1942
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,760
of my Apartments

1943
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:43,800
when people came by I just told them

1944
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,659
that was his initials that's my roommate

1945
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,340
they weren't allowed in the room as I

1946
01:18:45,658 --> 01:18:50,819
got he locks the doors you know he's

1947
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:53,699
away a lot kind of [ __ ] but yeah the Dan

1948
01:18:50,819 --> 01:18:56,279
Miller Bud was actually a garden but I

1949
01:18:53,698 --> 01:18:59,639
told people and he's a super [ __ ]

1950
01:18:56,279 --> 01:19:03,479
good guy he uh he left the nation a

1951
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:05,039
little sour unfortunately but um

1952
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:06,658
hopefully I resurrected that

1953
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:09,119
relationship because he was just one of

1954
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:12,238
those people that you know same thing if

1955
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:14,579
these seeds get uh reproduced or get

1956
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,139
saved he'd be the first one on the phone

1957
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:18,840
saying hey dude

1958
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:20,760
it's not the DMB but it has the DMV in

1959
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,699
it so if we do an open pop uh

1960
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:25,079
pollination there's a chance one of

1961
01:19:23,698 --> 01:19:28,079
those seeds is going to be your strain

1962
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:31,260
and you can have as much as you want

1963
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:34,619
kind of thing so I put them aside to

1964
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:37,260
kind of be so this is something else

1965
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:38,880
that came up when we would when I sent

1966
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,159
you that and I don't know if you can

1967
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:45,000
post the and I can send you a few more

1968
01:19:41,158 --> 01:19:47,939
actually the menu that we had back in

1969
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:52,439
the Great Canadian Emporium so uh early

1970
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:54,178
mid 90s to uh mid 90s okay which one

1971
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:56,698
specifically because I could put them up

1972
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:59,158
here yeah so basically any of the ones

1973
01:19:56,698 --> 01:20:00,960
but this one here has

1974
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:02,639
um this is how we used to sell the seeds

1975
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,319
right just a little well should say that

1976
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,000
this is how we sold some of the seeds

1977
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:10,019
and then they all just went into little

1978
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,238
uh the gram vials yeah selling but so

1979
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:16,940
this here is

1980
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,939
uh an Afghani black domino

1981
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:23,219
Scentsy skunk

1982
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:26,219
right nice so we were growing the

1983
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:28,500
the block dominant Scentsy skunk we

1984
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:30,480
crossed Blacktown with so much [ __ ] we

1985
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:34,140
bet loved

1986
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:36,178
the nug uh we really love the

1987
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:41,039
description that Scentsy put in their

1988
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:42,960
catalog Andrew our uh our minister of uh

1989
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,579
uh

1990
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,779
uh he was our artist he's the one that

1991
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:48,119
actually when you look at all the

1992
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:51,238
artwork from hemp Nation had Emporium

1993
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:53,880
days he's uh he's the artist

1994
01:20:51,238 --> 01:20:55,500
um yeah I I want to meet that guy I want

1995
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:59,119
to use some of that art like modern

1996
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,119
times that is awesome yeah

1997
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:06,299
the NYPD like he did characters of all

1998
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,520
of us right characters and I didn't have

1999
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:11,940
dreads back then but I had

2000
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:14,280
um I'd wear my hair in braided uh uh

2001
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:16,559
pigtails I guess because anytime I went

2002
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:18,840
out into the bush and I had to wear my

2003
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,480
backpack I had super long hair so I

2004
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:25,079
would braid on each side so it wouldn't

2005
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:27,299
get stuck in the backpack yeah and uh so

2006
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:29,579
he would he drew a picture of me

2007
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:32,400
you know with my braids and it's the

2008
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:34,500
release of the NYPD uh Cult of

2009
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:37,500
administer of Agriculture Sunday

2010
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:41,100
cannabis talks stuff like that but you

2011
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:44,279
know you'll see I I did find a few of

2012
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,780
these uh these Blends and again

2013
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:49,559
these are

2014
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:52,738
f1s these are we didn't breed these as

2015
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,420
much as we wanted to uh spread the seed

2016
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:57,599
but

2017
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:59,699
that's it I just remember the uh that

2018
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,520
sensu skunk

2019
01:21:59,698 --> 01:22:06,839
was huge for us back then you know what

2020
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:09,600
was it like it was a it was like

2021
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:13,560
it was you know how the super skunk has

2022
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:16,620
that really pungent smell the uh skunk

2023
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:19,440
one has that big Cola

2024
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:22,619
um this this Scentsy seemed to have like

2025
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:23,759
a little bit of the two where it was it

2026
01:22:22,619 --> 01:22:25,979
was

2027
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:29,219
um it had the it had the smell but it

2028
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:30,839
had the the structure and but didn't

2029
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:33,000
have the weight didn't have the big fat

2030
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,219
nugs where the dominant did so the

2031
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,300
Domino you know being a really greasy

2032
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:38,359
really

2033
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,360
um

2034
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:43,559
more singular even though we did I have

2035
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,659
pictures of a super cropping uh plant

2036
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,699
that we did of the Domino and the skunk

2037
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:49,198
one how would you describe the smell of

2038
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:51,539
your Dominic cut

2039
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:56,039
it was uh it was pretty nasty very kind

2040
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:58,979
of tarry kind of nice [ __ ] rubber

2041
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:02,340
kind of smell so that more noxious end

2042
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:04,559
yeah like it was it wasn't fruity by the

2043
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:06,900
the least of it it was pretty [ __ ]

2044
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,760
that sounds it was very sorry kind of

2045
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:12,658
yeah it smelled like asphalt kind of

2046
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:15,539
stuff kind of so but it also you know

2047
01:23:12,658 --> 01:23:17,639
when we super cropped it one plant would

2048
01:23:15,539 --> 01:23:19,380
give us

2049
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:22,100
[ __ ] I think the one plant was like

2050
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:25,319
three quarters of a pound inside

2051
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:27,539
and four feet tall

2052
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:29,579
right off the ground yeah that's nice

2053
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:33,238
pictures of it but it was super cropped

2054
01:23:29,579 --> 01:23:36,960
and it probably vegged for

2055
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:38,879
two months yeah I was bending and

2056
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,579
breaking and the skunk one same thing

2057
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,779
you know we weren't popping might have

2058
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:45,119
topped once

2059
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:49,198
but everything else was just [ __ ]

2060
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:50,939
bent down yeah and and tied down and the

2061
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:52,619
super do you call that low stress

2062
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:54,119
training is that like a term for it

2063
01:23:52,619 --> 01:23:56,658
today I call it high stress State

2064
01:23:54,119 --> 01:24:00,479
training like yeah exactly yeah

2065
01:23:56,658 --> 01:24:03,899
and and and LST are totally different

2066
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:05,519
yeah so what we were doing is that's why

2067
01:24:03,899 --> 01:24:07,259
I would call high stress because we were

2068
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,600
breaking like we were twisting and

2069
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:11,820
turning uh we weren't bending down we

2070
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,579
were breaking the inside herd oh so you

2071
01:24:11,819 --> 01:24:17,219
were popping that's super cropping to me

2072
01:24:14,579 --> 01:24:19,619
is when you break the inside yeah yeah

2073
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:22,500
and then it reforms and it makes like a

2074
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:24,238
nut Palace yeah that's different that's

2075
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:26,399
not I mean when we did the super

2076
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:28,559
cropping article and now supercrockman

2077
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:30,299
I'm not going to say take claim to it

2078
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:33,420
because it was shown to me by two local

2079
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:36,840
Growers yeah but when we did the article

2080
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:38,579
in high times before solma did his super

2081
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,699
cropping which was just a reproduction

2082
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:45,359
of what my of what the the

2083
01:24:41,698 --> 01:24:48,178
um article of about me I guess would be

2084
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:50,819
um it's you don't want that knuckle okay

2085
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:52,199
the knuckle is a weak point right it's a

2086
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:54,599
strength point but it's also a weak

2087
01:24:52,198 --> 01:24:56,759
point what you want is to have a knuckle

2088
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,320
on top of a knuckle on top of a knuckle

2089
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:04,260
on top of a knuckle on top of a knuckle

2090
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:06,658
so it the the the branch doesn't do this

2091
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:09,480
doesn't do this right angle it does this

2092
01:25:06,658 --> 01:25:11,399
Bend right so it's just like it's a

2093
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:12,718
knuckle here a knuckle like I don't know

2094
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:14,158
if you have it there's a knuckle here a

2095
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,319
knuckle here knuckle here knuckle here

2096
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:18,839
because I'm bending and breaking and

2097
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,619
then that plant [ __ ] like flattens

2098
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,400
out

2099
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:24,899
so just just so people that don't know

2100
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:27,719
generally super cropping is you're like

2101
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:30,859
breaking the inner herd yeah but you're

2102
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:33,600
trying to leave like the outside

2103
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:35,579
like that is unbroken so you're trying

2104
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,980
you're not trying to snap it so the

2105
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:40,920
outside breaks you're trying to snap it

2106
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:42,899
so you get an inner break yeah but go

2107
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,359
outside and then this is what Matt is

2108
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:47,879
saying low stress training is basically

2109
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:50,399
just bending it over and tying it

2110
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:53,579
without any kind of breaking with that

2111
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:55,500
yeah just like you just you're just

2112
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:57,960
redirecting where the hormones go

2113
01:25:55,500 --> 01:26:00,479
because of height yeah yeah and you you

2114
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:03,119
know people that tie my guy used to tie

2115
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:05,879
two by fours to his plant tops and the

2116
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:08,519
two by four would be you know six inches

2117
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:10,679
off the ground when he was done because

2118
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,060
he'd have eight branches tied to it and

2119
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,679
the next day be three inches off the

2120
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,940
ground and next maybe two inches off the

2121
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,920
ground and then eventually it's sitting

2122
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:18,238
on the ground right that's the low

2123
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,639
stress

2124
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:24,619
um we would still do that at certain

2125
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:27,000
times but the theory that I came up with

2126
01:26:24,619 --> 01:26:30,479
why this worked

2127
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,819
was because of this local kid that I met

2128
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:34,979
uh through the guys that showed me the

2129
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:37,559
super cropping technique and when he was

2130
01:26:34,979 --> 01:26:39,959
born his art his late he had a he was

2131
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:43,500
grown in a deformity where his legs were

2132
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:45,480
crossed inside his mother's womb and

2133
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,219
when he was born he couldn't walk

2134
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:50,579
obviously his legs were [ __ ] buckled

2135
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:54,300
up his [ __ ] his uh soles of his feet

2136
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:55,920
were pretty much turning upwards and for

2137
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:58,500
the first so many years of his life

2138
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,880
every year or six months or whatever

2139
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:02,158
they would go in and they would break

2140
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,420
the bone straighten it and then go and

2141
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:05,759
break the bone and then straighten it

2142
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:08,219
and then break the bone again so brutal

2143
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,560
yeah it took his legs from being this

2144
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:12,359
kind of bent in and every time it just

2145
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,739
broke it open broke it open broke it

2146
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:17,158
open straightened it straightened it

2147
01:27:13,738 --> 01:27:18,658
until he could walk yeah well

2148
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:20,698
I don't know if you have a broken bone

2149
01:27:18,658 --> 01:27:21,719
can't break a bone in the same place

2150
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:24,419
twice

2151
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:26,158
it's physically impossible

2152
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:27,179
right because you get such a calcium

2153
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:30,479
buildup

2154
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:32,039
on that so if we could bring if you

2155
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:37,019
could break your arm

2156
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:39,119
uh 20 times you can form your arm to be

2157
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:41,040
whatever shape you want it to be right

2158
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,300
so if you break it if you have your arm

2159
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:44,519
and it's broken

2160
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,800
where am I and then you break it and you

2161
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:48,900
set it this way and then you set it this

2162
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,840
way and then you set it this way your

2163
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:54,899
forearm will be bent like that and

2164
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,699
sturdy yeah you know

2165
01:27:54,899 --> 01:27:58,920
we did the same that's what we do it do

2166
01:27:56,698 --> 01:28:00,658
with the plant we were super cropping it

2167
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:02,460
and at the very beginning you can't

2168
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:04,379
Twist and Turn you have to just pinch

2169
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:07,260
yeah you just go around it because it's

2170
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:09,719
so soft tissue and you just slowly pinch

2171
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:12,060
and you don't pinch in the same way on

2172
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:13,619
the same side and same angle you rotate

2173
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:16,020
you rotate yeah

2174
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:17,819
until the whole plant is like this and

2175
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,679
then the next day you're going to see

2176
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:21,420
that nut that shoot pop up and it's

2177
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,679
going to be sitting like this

2178
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:25,800
right where it's going to be kind of

2179
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:27,420
bent up and then eventually you know

2180
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,820
that's going to be strong enough that

2181
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:32,399
you can have your main Cola

2182
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:34,079
two feet off the ground four feet or

2183
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:36,000
three feet from the center of where your

2184
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:38,100
plant is and not have to use any tomato

2185
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:42,179
cages not have to use anything because

2186
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:43,679
that that uh inside herd is one solid so

2187
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:45,239
you know when you you harvest the plant

2188
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,340
you cut it down you can see sometimes

2189
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:49,799
that Center

2190
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:51,960
um canal in the middle of a in the

2191
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,579
middle of your branch sure well when we

2192
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,899
were super cropping especially towards

2193
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:56,760
the end of it when we were doing it with

2194
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:58,559
the big moms it would take two people

2195
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,719
we'd have one guy holding a broomstick

2196
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,600
and the other guy [ __ ] push until you

2197
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,100
hear that snap

2198
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,719
come back we'd snap it the other way and

2199
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:09,120
stuff like that right like

2200
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,639
when you went to cut that plant down you

2201
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:14,158
couldn't use [ __ ] scissors to cut the

2202
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:17,340
[ __ ] branches off yeah there's a

2203
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:19,859
[ __ ] saw because it was solid kind of

2204
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:21,960
thing so we would uh so the block Domino

2205
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:23,579
is great for that the skunk one was

2206
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,439
great for that

2207
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:28,198
um but I get you know what it was the

2208
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:30,479
black dominant that was like the key

2209
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:32,759
to it and uh

2210
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:35,099
I know I do have pictures of this the

2211
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,960
one group black dominant plant that this

2212
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:39,360
kid grew and he's a mutual friend of

2213
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,939
Shawnee kids and mine yeah we were

2214
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:45,960
speaking about them last time uh till

2215
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:47,460
we'll just call them till for now but um

2216
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,800
um

2217
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:51,179
he was an epileptic that didn't leave

2218
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,219
his house very much so he was perfect

2219
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:55,859
candidate to show this technique too

2220
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:59,399
sure hey [ __ ] trained all these

2221
01:29:55,859 --> 01:30:02,099
plants and you know if he if he wanted

2222
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:05,719
to you know if he had the focus he could

2223
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,719
have created you know

2224
01:30:05,939 --> 01:30:10,799
two pounds off of three plants onto one

2225
01:30:08,698 --> 01:30:12,960
light kind of thing yeah but you could

2226
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,119
it's super cropping is designed for

2227
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:19,380
people like right now in Canada we can

2228
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:20,939
have four plants yeah but if you have a

2229
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:22,859
basement that has seven foot ceilings

2230
01:30:20,939 --> 01:30:26,519
four plants isn't going to give you very

2231
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:29,519
much exactly yeah you know I know one

2232
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,400
guy that has uh one plant per thousand

2233
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:34,800
watt and each plant covers you know

2234
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:36,960
probably a five foot by five foot space

2235
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,639
I don't think he's growing anymore but

2236
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,260
um you know was I don't know if he was

2237
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,900
super cropping either but that's what

2238
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:45,600
SuperCraft movies intend for that's why

2239
01:30:42,899 --> 01:30:47,698
um Kyle uh flew me to Amsterdam and had

2240
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,039
me talk at the Cannabis Cup and that was

2241
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:52,799
the my topic my topic was basically

2242
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:54,960
super cropping and and why and how kind

2243
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,159
of that's so wild yeah really early take

2244
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,119
on it

2245
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:00,359
um

2246
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:03,899
oh here's your [ __ ] I can't you can't

2247
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:06,960
feminine self-pollination so they're G8

2248
01:31:03,899 --> 01:31:09,238
so the golden Haze okay so that's my

2249
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,819
strain and it just says self-pollinated

2250
01:31:09,238 --> 01:31:13,678
which to me means hermaphrodite yeah

2251
01:31:11,819 --> 01:31:16,198
yeah I would not want to grow this

2252
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,300
[ __ ] plant yeah I totally grow them

2253
01:31:16,198 --> 01:31:20,339
yeah

2254

2276
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:15,359
the first if not the first Honor Guard

2277
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:17,639
person yeah I I do that at my friend's

2278
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:20,279
record store except that he doesn't like

2279
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:21,719
that I do that yeah I try to just go in

2280
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:24,420
and just take what I want it's pretty

2281
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:25,920
cool yeah well these guys there's a few

2282
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:29,340
people in this town

2283
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:32,219
uh uh that have that anybody from hemp

2284
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:33,900
Nation family yeah knew whether they

2285
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:36,600
took advantage of or not if they walked

2286
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:38,279
into organic traveler my head shop yeah

2287
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:41,639
they take whatever the [ __ ] they want

2288
01:32:38,279 --> 01:32:45,119
like they built me

2289
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:45,719
they are the foundations to

2290
01:32:45,119 --> 01:32:48,119
um

2291
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:50,639
to

2292
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:52,679
to what we are they they lay they're the

2293
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,779
ones that kind of lay down to for us to

2294
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:56,520
to bring to blaze this path that we're

2295
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:58,979
on so

2296
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,420
when again and this was probably when I

2297
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:03,419
was being a little bit more protective

2298
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:05,880
of my genetics but skip said Hey listen

2299
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:06,960
you know like I wanna I wanna grow your

2300
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,840
your

2301
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:13,139
um your golden Haze in my backyard all

2302
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:14,239
right he's like and I have this uh blue

2303
01:33:13,139 --> 01:33:16,739
skunk

2304
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:19,198
and I have a male of it I want to cross

2305
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:22,039
it and it's just like well I don't have

2306
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:23,719
seeds of the golden Haze other than

2307
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:26,760
self-pollinated

2308
01:33:23,719 --> 01:33:28,439
but I said you know what if you want to

2309
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,340
do that you do it kind of thing and he

2310
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:30,899
gave me

2311
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:32,400
you know I probably gave you as many

2312
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:36,138
suits as I wanted but I only have maybe

2313
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:39,079
15 seeds left and I just call it the GHB

2314
01:33:36,139 --> 01:33:42,380
which is a unique name

2315
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:45,420
indeed yeah indeed

2316
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:48,319
again we're going back to like the early

2317
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:51,440
mid 90s sure

2318
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:53,759
having a moment in the sun then

2319
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:56,579
I didn't in Canada I was just like

2320
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,920
listen it's golden Haze crosses the blue

2321
01:33:56,579 --> 01:34:00,380
skunk so I'm calling it GHB yeah there

2322
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:04,260
you go yeah

2323
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:05,639
and it's a sativa dominant one right so

2324
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:08,159
he had an Indica dominant one he had

2325
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:10,619
steva he liked the sativa one I named

2326
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:13,500
strain the skipper schema right because

2327
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:16,198
his name was skip kind of thing so same

2328
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:18,960
thing genetics that mean [ __ ] all the

2329
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:21,000
some will mean [ __ ] all anybody but if

2330
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,739
they grow these out if they find that

2331
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,020
golden Haze

2332
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:26,698
I guarantee you're gonna [ __ ] love it

2333
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:30,659
just because of

2334
01:34:26,698 --> 01:34:33,299
what's in it and what like how it

2335
01:34:30,658 --> 01:34:37,399
produces what it does yeah because it

2336
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:41,460
was that fruity sativa fast flowering

2337
01:34:37,399 --> 01:34:43,920
short fat plant which you just you don't

2338
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:45,539
you don't care I wanted to I wanted to

2339
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,480
interject something because anybody

2340
01:34:45,539 --> 01:34:51,600
anybody that was growing in the 90s you

2341
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:54,359
just you just uh threw out like what I

2342
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:57,300
would think is like a very common

2343
01:34:54,359 --> 01:34:59,759
you know it's like sort of uh sort of

2344
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:01,980
viewpoint which is oh man this thing's

2345
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:04,260
self-pollinated or it made some seeds

2346
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:06,059
I'm not that interested in these because

2347
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:08,400
this will screw up the rest of my stuff

2348
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:11,219
because of how it was made yeah and

2349
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:13,319
we've had a sea change in uh in in

2350
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:15,779
whether that's acceptable most people

2351
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:16,799
that started growing in the 90s that was

2352
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:19,679
The View

2353
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:22,340
was hermaphrodism was going to introduce

2354
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,340
something weird

2355
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:30,000
and then you know Matt is one of the

2356
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:32,600
card carrying original members of gender

2357
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,719
fluidity is good

2358
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:40,380
and we should we should we should not

2359
01:35:35,719 --> 01:35:43,079
hate on this form of breeding yep maybe

2360
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:46,340
I'm old school but chicks with dicks I'm

2361
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:49,679
not a big Keen of chicks with dicks

2362
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:51,020
with the times bro it's very it's you

2363
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:53,520
know

2364
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:56,520
I go to a party and I want to hang out

2365
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:59,340
with chicks I don't want to [ __ ] be

2366
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:01,219
surprised you just gotta suck it that's

2367
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:04,560
what not so told me anyways

2368
01:36:01,219 --> 01:36:06,779
he's so mad you know but you know you

2369
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,000
know in all seriousness you know Matt

2370
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:11,759
Matt can tell you that he got a lot of

2371
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,859
pushback and a lot of hate when he

2372
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:15,960
started pushing feminized breeding at

2373
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:17,819
first oh God because it was considered

2374
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:19,460
to be a cheat code it was considered to

2375
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:23,039
be weakening

2376
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:26,939
messaging tools I was ruining genetics

2377
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:28,738
it was it was scandalous behavior my

2378
01:36:26,939 --> 01:36:31,019
favorite my favorite was that I was

2379
01:36:28,738 --> 01:36:33,899
ruining what God intended to be natural

2380
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:36,239
and I'd point out actually they started

2381
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:37,879
out intersex so I think I'm putting them

2382
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:40,678
back to normal

2383
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:43,020
you know what I mean like yeah I didn't

2384
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:45,539
see it and any of that I didn't get that

2385
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:48,179
deep I basically said

2386
01:36:45,539 --> 01:36:50,460
you know when I'm growing and especially

2387
01:36:48,179 --> 01:36:54,000
in larger scale anything over a few

2388
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:57,899
plants actually or with somebody with

2389
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,939
especially my uh clients that don't know

2390
01:36:57,899 --> 01:37:00,719
what to look for where if a banana pops

2391
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:04,138
out

2392
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:06,239
then I got CD pot and I know that's

2393
01:37:04,139 --> 01:37:09,119
unpractical you know I'm not going to

2394
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:11,339
proceeding yeah right so if I see that

2395
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:14,119
scene like I said earlier I believe and

2396
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:17,520
I honestly believe this to be true that

2397
01:37:14,119 --> 01:37:20,039
95 of what we grow are

2398
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:23,280
Hermie to one to a certain percentage to

2399
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:25,260
a certain degree yeah right where some

2400
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:27,119
might be you just have to sneeze and it

2401
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:29,280
[ __ ] shoots out a banana some that

2402
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:31,738
you have to [ __ ] go as far as you

2403
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:32,880
know colonial silver or gelberic acid or

2404
01:37:31,738 --> 01:37:34,738
something that you really have to

2405
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,779
[ __ ] stress it to produce that flower

2406
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:39,718
I know you said there's different ways

2407
01:37:36,779 --> 01:37:41,219
and methods now but in my old school

2408
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:43,198
mentality

2409
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:46,279
that's what I always thought I thought

2410
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:48,299
they're producing feminized not female

2411
01:37:46,279 --> 01:37:50,759
feminized seeds and there's a big

2412
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,539
difference between an all-female seed

2413
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,119
pack

2414
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:56,880
and a feminized feminized seeds means

2415
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:58,198
you're not going to get a male it

2416
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,179
doesn't say you're not going to get a

2417
01:37:58,198 --> 01:38:04,019
hermaphrodite it's I think it's a very

2418
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:06,060
high likely that if you are going to

2419
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:08,280
have any hiccups in your

2420
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:09,780
Garden if you especially outdoors I

2421
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:11,519
would never put a feminized seized

2422
01:38:09,779 --> 01:38:15,179
outdoor because it's so out of your

2423
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:17,639
control or in somebody's Garden that is

2424
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:19,440
not you know

2425
01:38:17,639 --> 01:38:21,359
um on top of everything and

2426
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:23,279
knowledgeable where they can keep a

2427
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:25,799
perfect environment and watering

2428
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:28,139
schedule and temperature and and

2429
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:30,300
um feed program all that kind of thing

2430
01:38:28,139 --> 01:38:32,940
where you any kind of stress it's going

2431
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:35,460
to trigger it sooner to produce seed and

2432
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:38,460
produce pollen that's going to give you

2433
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:40,020
a self-pollinated plant or an alpha

2434
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:42,600
breeding sure it's great for breeding

2435
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,699
I'll give him that but not for me I

2436
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:46,860
tried I tried my best over the past 15

2437
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:48,719
years to completely destroy the term

2438
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:51,000
feminized because I always thought it

2439
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:53,939
was really really bad term I thought I

2440
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,439
thought female seeds was a bad term I

2441
01:38:53,939 --> 01:38:57,059
thought reversed made the most sense

2442
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:58,559
because you're reversing the sex on a

2443
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:01,620
plant and that's describing the action

2444
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:03,239
but what to expect it you shouldn't be

2445
01:39:01,619 --> 01:39:05,279
telling people what to expect because

2446
01:39:03,238 --> 01:39:08,399
there's absolutely every possibility

2447
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:10,859
that a plant can be you know have female

2448
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:12,500
chromosomes and pop up completely

2449
01:39:10,859 --> 01:39:15,539
looking male

2450
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:16,738
and uh the way the legal Market Works

2451
01:39:15,539 --> 01:39:18,359
currently

2452
01:39:16,738 --> 01:39:20,158
um all the stuff that I've been involved

2453
01:39:18,359 --> 01:39:24,059
in that does any kind of large-scale

2454
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:26,638
seed popping yeah it's all feminized

2455
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:28,320
seed yeah because nobody wants to get

2456
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,359
out there and be like I have so I'm

2457
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:33,479
gonna have somewhere between 30 and 70

2458
01:39:30,359 --> 01:39:35,819
percent be males yeah so I'm gonna have

2459
01:39:33,479 --> 01:39:38,698
a crew spend weeks out there every every

2460
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:42,000
day going and hacking down boys before

2461
01:39:38,698 --> 01:39:43,500
they throw pollen right yeah anyway

2462
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
because some of them are gonna some of

2463
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,380
them are gonna be

2464
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,079
um fake you know I don't want to say

2465
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:51,539
fake males but like uh even better for

2466
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:54,119
it yeah even with even with feminized

2467
01:39:51,539 --> 01:39:55,738
populations and I've I've popped you

2468
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:58,139
know some pretty large groups at this

2469
01:39:55,738 --> 01:40:00,899
point occasionally you'll get what looks

2470
01:39:58,139 --> 01:40:03,539
like a true male yeah like not a

2471
01:40:00,899 --> 01:40:05,638
hermaphrodite not not something with

2472
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:08,460
male and female flowers but something

2473
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:10,739
that actually looks like a true male

2474
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:12,480
plant they do pop up right but that's

2475
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:14,519
what I was getting at too where you know

2476
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:15,839
and again this is with lack of knowledge

2477
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:18,000
but

2478
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,920
um where you have or what I believe to

2479
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,439
have a

2480
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:25,079
female plant and a male plant and when

2481
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:26,819
you uh when you do the when you have a

2482
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:28,679
hermaphrodite because we're dealing with

2483
01:40:26,819 --> 01:40:31,639
a mother and a father we're bringing

2484
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:35,039
into two two chromosomes

2485
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:37,199
there's a very there's a very Mo very

2486
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:39,060
good life likelihood that we're going to

2487
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:43,019
have both of them carry over

2488
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:46,679
right and in cannabis especially being a

2489
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:50,639
a seed bearing plant that will uh go

2490
01:40:46,679 --> 01:40:53,219
into the ability to self-pollinate to

2491
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,840
continue its life throughout the season

2492
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:56,520
or throughout

2493
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,260
um and I think again why I think it's

2494
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:00,780
written into Genesis into the Bible is

2495
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:02,520
you know for this reason where it's one

2496
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:04,198
of those unique plants that if it thinks

2497
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:06,060
that oh [ __ ] you know there's only

2498
01:41:04,198 --> 01:41:08,279
females around we're not going to be

2499
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:10,139
able to reproduce they're going to flip

2500
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:14,099
one of those females to produce some

2501
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:16,739
pollen and therefore have drop seed for

2502
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:18,780
the following uh season kind of that's

2503
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:20,759
what I think makes hermaphrodism so hard

2504
01:41:18,779 --> 01:41:22,500
and people get all angry about it where

2505
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,900
I'm like okay so this plan has existed

2506
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:28,979
for millions of years yeah and this was

2507
01:41:24,899 --> 01:41:31,859
a super successful like strategy for it

2508
01:41:28,979 --> 01:41:33,539
to be able to make seeds at times when

2509
01:41:31,859 --> 01:41:35,939
something might have happened right

2510
01:41:33,539 --> 01:41:37,399
right and then sometime in the 90s we

2511
01:41:35,939 --> 01:41:41,158
were like oh we don't want this anymore

2512
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:44,339
so 30 30 years ago people were like you

2513
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:46,559
know let's get away from this thousands

2514
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:48,779
of years of selection right and when

2515
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,940
everybody was was growing seeded weed

2516
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:52,380
and you know all the Thai and all the

2517
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:54,178
Colombian and all the Mexican and

2518
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:56,460
everything else was fully seeded who

2519
01:41:54,179 --> 01:41:58,440
cares if there was hermaphrodites no

2520
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:01,319
exactly I think you already you already

2521
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:03,178
were getting flour full of seed yeah so

2522
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:04,979
it really wasn't actually it came to is

2523
01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:07,679
this you know for people like myself

2524
01:42:04,979 --> 01:42:10,738
that started smoking pot in the

2525
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:14,460
depending on memory it's either the late

2526
01:42:10,738 --> 01:42:16,500
70s 79 or 80 81.

2527
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:20,899
um that we had to get the credit card

2528
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:23,939
and the [ __ ] album cover out yeah

2529
01:42:20,899 --> 01:42:25,379
[ __ ] and pull out all that Seed where

2530
01:42:23,939 --> 01:42:27,599
the [ __ ] you think I got my seed to

2531
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:30,600
start everything that I started with was

2532
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,980
you know got a great bag of [ __ ] weed

2533
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:34,920
didn't know where the [ __ ] came from

2534
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:36,899
probably was compressed has seeds in it

2535
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:38,639
I don't want I mean they I'm gonna grow

2536
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:41,519
them they might finish they might not I

2537
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:44,400
don't know right but we did breed a lot

2538
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:47,159
of [ __ ] [ __ ] a lot of [ __ ] into this

2539
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:48,658
plant we bred CBD out of the [ __ ]

2540
01:42:47,158 --> 01:42:50,339
plant pretty much right because we were

2541
01:42:48,658 --> 01:42:53,039
so full we went through the stage of

2542
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:56,279
focusing so much on THC

2543
01:42:53,039 --> 01:43:00,238
focusing so much on just strong females

2544
01:42:56,279 --> 01:43:03,238
right that uh we we lost track of you

2545
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,738
know the beauty of the versatility of

2546
01:43:03,238 --> 01:43:07,979
this plant well do you know what do you

2547
01:43:04,738 --> 01:43:10,198
know what CBD was before testing

2548
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:12,779
it was just weeds that didn't work yeah

2549
01:43:10,198 --> 01:43:15,299
yeah it was hemp you know it wasn't like

2550
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:17,698
we were like oh that is CBD in it you're

2551
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:19,619
like oh this one doesn't get me high

2552
01:43:17,698 --> 01:43:22,500
well we're going to eliminate this one

2553
01:43:19,618 --> 01:43:23,219
this one doesn't work good it's gone I

2554
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,319
have

2555
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:26,760
um you know people ask me like oh what

2556
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:29,158
was you know what's your favorite pot

2557
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:32,219
and I was like you know what we used to

2558
01:43:29,158 --> 01:43:34,799
buy our pot on this on B15 which was a

2559
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:38,520
Street in East Rockaway New York

2560
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:39,420
and uh it was the five dollar

2561
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,320
um

2562
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:42,779
um

2563
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:45,179
oh yeah some of our first catalogs yeah

2564
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:46,679
which is remind me I think this strain

2565
01:43:45,179 --> 01:43:48,000
is on that too

2566
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:49,739
but

2567
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,079
people ask me like what is your favorite

2568
01:43:49,738 --> 01:43:53,819
uh some of your favorite pot and I was

2569
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:56,279
like this brickweed that we got back in

2570
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:59,399
like [ __ ] uh

2571
01:43:56,279 --> 01:44:01,979
uh 82-83 because it got me super high

2572
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:03,599
didn't get me stoned got me super high

01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:32,939
we because you can see we did a lot of

2584
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:36,359
the skunk one crosses there

2585
01:44:32,939 --> 01:44:38,399

the skunk one on there but what you'll

2590
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:53,399
also notice is like when you get into

2591
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:55,439
like the uh s50 s48 The Golden Boy The

2592
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:57,539
Golden Boy was something that I

2593
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:58,919
crossed a lot of stuff with because I

2594
01:44:57,539 --> 01:45:00,359
wanted that

2595
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:03,118
um

2596
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:06,359
um that quick I want I you know I love

2597
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:09,238
the purple star it's short fast you know

2598
01:45:06,359 --> 01:45:11,279
um that silver haze Mexican sativa I

2599
01:45:09,238 --> 01:45:14,459
grew this one this Mexican sativa

2600
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:16,859
Outdoors here along the uh along the

2601
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:18,420
Cliffs of Lake Erie

2602
01:45:16,859 --> 01:45:21,238
I had this great Garden because you

2603
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:23,880
could be you could hang it on the on the

2604
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:25,138
beach or on the boat like be out on the

2605
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,679
boat and you couldn't see the garden

2606
01:45:25,139 --> 01:45:31,560
because of the slope was

2607
01:45:28,679 --> 01:45:34,800
um away it sloped away from the the lake

2608
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:36,780
so I grew these big huge massive sativas

2609
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:39,420
I got a problem I don't give a [ __ ] I'm

2610
01:45:36,779 --> 01:45:41,460
not you know I go for fun

2611
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:42,960
um especially there was I get to go to

2612
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:45,960
the beach and hang out with chicks and

2613
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:48,539
and so on and um

2614
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:50,100
and then erosion came and it took down a

2615
01:45:48,539 --> 01:45:53,158
good section of the garden and then

2616
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:54,420
you'd be cruising down like October into

2617
01:45:53,158 --> 01:45:56,460
November

2618
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:58,560
down the coast and you'd look up and

2619
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:01,079
there'd be these huge wall of [ __ ]

2620
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,539
these sativa plants these Mexican sativa

2621
01:46:01,079 --> 01:46:05,880
plants that were just starting to flower

2622
01:46:03,539 --> 01:46:08,579
in like mid-november

2623
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:10,800
right wow you're gonna finish but they

2624
01:46:08,579 --> 01:46:14,340
were these wall of cannabis that exposed

2625
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:17,340
my entire Garden to to the world yeah

2626
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:19,440
kind of thing but you know I like I want

2627
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:21,779
that sativa this is again chasing that

2628
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:23,638

2633
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:36,118
a little bit of God knows what kind of

2634
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:38,399
[ __ ] it would be like either we just

2635
01:46:36,118 --> 01:46:40,319
forgot or like there was extra seeds or

2636
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:41,759
you know where we put them in packs of

2637
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:43,319
six and we had three of these left over

2638
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,820
throw them in the [ __ ] mystery seed

2639
01:46:43,319 --> 01:46:48,779

2645
01:47:01,618 --> 01:47:07,319
a seed company that sold again it's it's

2646

2718
01:49:55,859 --> 01:50:00,559
um

2719
01:49:57,899 --> 01:50:04,738
our version of

2720
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:06,900
why nation was formed okay basically

2721
01:50:04,738 --> 01:50:09,599
what it was is I think we kind of you

2722
01:50:06,899 --> 01:50:12,359
know back in the Reagan days we had oh

2723
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:16,020
no backstory to that Nixon coined that

2724
01:50:12,359 --> 01:50:19,079
War on Drugs right and they saw cannabis

2725
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:21,420
as a [ __ ] uh schedule one [ __ ]

2726
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:23,880
same as heroin cocaine drug

2727
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:24,840
right it was well it was it was more

2728
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:28,920
like

2729
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:31,619
weed was people that used weed didn't

2730
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:34,380
vote for Nixon right people that used

2731
01:50:31,618 --> 01:50:38,519
weed were minorities and anti-war

2732
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:41,039
protesters and Dems and groups that they

2733
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:43,619
had issues with at the time right so it

2734
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:45,899
was a youthful club and that they could

2735
01:50:43,618 --> 01:50:47,158
use it to attack groups that didn't

2736
01:50:45,899 --> 01:50:49,859
affect them

2737
01:50:47,158 --> 01:50:54,299
well pretty much with um

2738
01:50:49,859 --> 01:50:56,039
with the uh the War on Drugs you know we

2739
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:58,560
took it as

2740
01:50:56,039 --> 01:51:03,060
you know a war against us

2741
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:06,840
right I suppose them so we formed hemp

2742
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:09,960
Nation nation was formed and built in a

2743
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:13,679
regiment that was militant in a sense

2744
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:17,939
right so the marching seed right the one

2745
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:21,779
uh artwork I just sent you is uh HB post

2746
01:51:17,939 --> 01:51:25,319
dreads uh in a tank you know that has a

2747
01:51:21,779 --> 01:51:29,880
bong as its um Cannon kind of thing yeah

2748
01:51:25,319 --> 01:51:33,479
and it's because we were there to fight

2749
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:37,020
the battle right so I feel that way I

2750
01:51:33,479 --> 01:51:38,399
mean I think that uh that well one of

2751
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:40,739
the things I almost thought about

2752
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:44,099
mentioning it was that you know because

2753
01:51:40,738 --> 01:51:46,738
because you're a a citizen of both

2754
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:49,920
places yeah right you've been able to

2755
01:51:46,738 --> 01:51:53,339
move back and forth right where a lot of

2756
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:56,520
us get trapped on one side of the other

2757
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:57,840
fighting the battle you know you get

2758
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:59,280
wrapped up in something and they're like

2759
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:02,940
oh no you can't come back here anymore

2760
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:05,579
not you no you know

2761
01:52:02,939 --> 01:52:09,000

2762
01:52:05,579 --> 01:52:11,698

2781
01:52:51,539 --> 01:52:56,399
you know and it that that's what I say

2782
01:52:53,939 --> 01:52:57,779
like the the coin overgrow the

2783
01:52:56,399 --> 01:53:00,539
government

2784
01:52:57,779 --> 01:53:03,118
um came from and there will be uh more

2785

2786
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:07,559
um

2787
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:09,539
what the hell was Andrew saying so

2788
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:12,420
he was like

2789
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:15,060
minister of defense that was his thing

2790
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:17,399
right so we had minister of knowledge

2791
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:19,860
which was Sarah and she took care of the

2792
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:21,658
library in the museum and then we had

2793
01:53:19,859 --> 01:53:23,099
minister of Labor which is Billy he took

2794
01:53:21,658 --> 01:53:25,500

2795
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:27,119
Agriculture I took care of the seeds and

2796
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:29,399
minister of defense and that was Andrew

2797
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:33,059
who was quite

2798
01:53:29,399 --> 01:53:35,460
angry here's the angriest of us all but

2799
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:38,820
the way that the government was treating

2800
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:42,960
us kind of thing and because of his

2801
01:53:38,819 --> 01:53:45,840
super [ __ ] Talent he put it to um

2802
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:48,658
to drawings and if you walked into hemp

2803
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:50,699
Nation back in the day one we had the

2804
01:53:48,658 --> 01:53:52,799
hemp Nation flag that's there right the

2805
01:53:50,698 --> 01:53:56,519
pot leaf the green pot leaf

2806
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:59,159
right uh in the in the red uh red bars

2807
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:02,159
like

2808
01:53:59,158 --> 01:54:03,960
um but then that was

2809
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:07,079
probably like

2810
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:11,039
20 feet by 40 feet in our front window

2811
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:13,198
right so we like there like I'm getting

2812
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:15,179
back to which we were

2813
01:54:13,198 --> 01:54:18,118
we were fighting the war on drugs and we

2814
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:21,480
formed the nation and Chris Kristen have

2815
01:54:18,118 --> 01:54:24,000
a Ministry he was a grand Cola

2816
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:25,799
um he was he was that he was the [ __ ]

2817
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,380
the one that told us

2818
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:30,659
kind of what we were doing and how did

2819
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:33,000
yeah how to do it but what he wanted to

2820
01:54:30,658 --> 01:54:35,638
see done yeah you know

2821
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,439
so uh getting back to scenes because I

2822
01:54:35,639 --> 01:54:38,340
know we were getting pretty long on our

2823
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:42,000
time

2824
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:43,079
I found my chemo seats oh awesome and

2825
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,439
now

2826
01:54:43,079 --> 01:54:50,158
they're in this little [ __ ] container

2827
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:52,219
and it's just written chemo and there's

2828
01:54:50,158 --> 01:54:52,219
um

2829
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:55,679
there's how many seasons there's like

2830
01:54:54,118 --> 01:54:58,019
five seeds and they're little tiny

2831
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:04,260
[ __ ] seats yeah

2832
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:05,340
which I think is the uh UBC because the

2833
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:06,360
the

2834
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:07,980
Ottawa cut

2835
01:55:06,359 --> 01:55:11,039
which

2836
01:55:07,979 --> 01:55:14,039
you know I thought the chemo came from I

2837
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:16,500
I believe 100 I was wrong or we were

2838
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:18,899
wrong when we thought that

2839
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:21,420
um wasn't really chemo but it was a

2840
01:55:18,899 --> 01:55:24,319
chemo that we knew yeah and it was

2841
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:27,719
better than the [ __ ] chemo

2842
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:31,380
man it was a [ __ ] crazy strong fat

2843
01:55:27,719 --> 01:55:35,279
nasty [ __ ] plant nug

2844
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:38,520
where the UBC chemo was very quaint and

2845
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:41,819
pink and floral like it was it didn't

2846
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:44,880
have that same Rusty [ __ ] greasy

2847
01:55:41,819 --> 01:55:48,479
smell yeah but uh that's a good way to

2848
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:51,539
describe something rusty yeah it didn't

2849
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:52,919
know like it was nice it was like a I

2850
01:55:51,539 --> 01:55:55,260
don't even know it's like you would get

2851
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:58,500
hit with a [ __ ] metal pipe kind of

2852
01:55:55,260 --> 01:56:00,719
high it was [ __ ] crazy strong kind of

2853
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:03,679
stuff so now this is the other thing you

2854
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:09,719
guys know the history on gelato right

2855
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:12,060
yeah okay I came across seeds

2856
01:56:09,719 --> 01:56:13,739
that I can't even but I'm pretty sure

2857
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:15,659
and it's hard you won't be able to see

2858
01:56:13,738 --> 01:56:16,678
it I don't think but I swear it says

2859
01:56:15,658 --> 01:56:19,339
gelato

2860
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:23,359
now these seeds are from

2861
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:25,800
the 90s this CPAC box was from the 90s

2862
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:28,439
they wouldn't be related you know

2863
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:30,119
probably just a similar name yeah if

2864
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:32,339
again this is where I was kind of

2865
01:56:30,118 --> 01:56:35,519
getting at before where

2866
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:37,440
why is it called gelato well a guy grew

2867
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,659
a [ __ ] plant a seed

2868
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:43,859
Tate smoked it [ __ ] tastes like gelato

2869
01:56:39,658 --> 01:56:45,719
yeah gelato yeah so maybe that's what it

2870
01:56:43,859 --> 01:56:48,779
is I don't know

2871
01:56:45,719 --> 01:56:50,520
um but again where did gelato come from

2872
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:52,920
how was it made

2873
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:56,159
[ __ ] like that uh go through quickly

2874
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:59,100
again the nebula uh oh yeah yeah that's

2875
01:56:56,158 --> 01:57:01,379
cool because I really like Luke and him

2876
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:03,659
and I get along quite well I'd probably

2877
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:04,980
get along best with Luke out of all the

2878
01:57:03,658 --> 01:57:06,000
uh

2879
01:57:04,979 --> 01:57:08,819
um

2880
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,779
see people there Aryan whose name I

2881
01:57:08,819 --> 01:57:13,198

2892
01:57:34,618 --> 01:57:39,658
that people really do like him and then

2893

the Homegrown fantasies the blue haze

2894
01:57:39,658 --> 01:57:45,059
that's cool yeah so now so with the the

2895
01:57:42,779 --> 01:57:49,618
blue haze here

2896
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:52,320
these seeds in here are not the

2897
01:57:49,618 --> 01:57:55,380
seeds from the pack gotcha these seeds

2898
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:57,840
in this pack are from when we grew out

2899
01:57:55,380 --> 01:58:00,859
the the blue haze

2900
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:04,679
and we picked a male and a female

2901
01:58:00,859 --> 01:58:07,439
to pollinate my golden Haze that we said

2902
01:58:04,679 --> 01:58:10,139
before the skipper yeah well we captive

2903
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:15,539
uh we kept we chose one of the females

2904
01:58:10,139 --> 01:58:18,118
and read our own blue haze yeah so it's

2905
01:58:15,539 --> 01:58:20,099
not going to be the exact it's not their

2906
01:58:18,118 --> 01:58:24,420
seed but it's a seed that we use to make

2907
01:58:20,099 --> 01:58:26,400
their seeds so gotcha being uh maybe not

2908
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:29,819
an open population where we used all the

2909
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:32,579
males and all the females we did choose

2910
01:58:29,819 --> 01:58:34,920
a female I'm sorry we choose we put more

2911
01:58:32,579 --> 01:58:36,719
thought into the male than we did the

2912
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:39,118
female we chose the best female but we

2913
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:41,340
were looking for that male that I would

2914
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:45,079
want to grow across with the golden or

2915
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:45,079
skip one and it crosses the golden Haze

2916
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:50,339
um and then we get it so what time is

2917
01:58:47,698 --> 01:58:52,919
that oh so then we get into like

2918
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:54,719
um oh that's new too

2919
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:57,079
um

2920
01:58:54,719 --> 01:59:02,399
uh so the the

2921
01:58:57,079 --> 01:59:05,219
skunk one nice from Scentsy again going

2922
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:06,839
back to that age yep

2923
01:59:05,219 --> 01:59:10,319
um and then

2924
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:13,199
we on that last catalog you'll see that

2925
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:16,198
we we carry the skunk one so these are

2926
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:18,598
one seeds that I made

2927
01:59:16,198 --> 01:59:19,919
using the skunk one seeds from Amsterdam

2928
01:59:18,599 --> 01:59:23,940
again

2929
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:28,319
breeding for seed production not for uh

2930
01:59:23,939 --> 01:59:30,960
genetic uh sure and then we did

2931
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:33,118
the the pure skunk

2932
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:37,679
okay Earth appear from Flying Dutchman

2933
01:59:33,118 --> 01:59:39,598
yeah so same thing so did it did it do

2934
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,719
what we wanted

2935
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:41,719
um

2936
01:59:42,118 --> 01:59:46,799
because I keep calling him Eddie I don't

2937
01:59:44,099 --> 01:59:50,760
know who's Flying Dutchman Eddie it is

2938
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:52,800
Eddie okay so okay 100 he was again

2939
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:54,960
wanted from what I'm told one of the

2940
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:57,179
original skunk

2941
01:59:54,960 --> 02:00:00,300
uh

2942
01:59:57,179 --> 02:00:02,819
uh holders let's say in sellers over

2943
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:06,659
there yeah but so he was one that had

2944
02:00:02,819 --> 02:00:09,719
like let's say the oldest lineage in

2945
02:00:06,658 --> 02:00:12,118
Amsterdam for the skunk one

2946
02:00:09,719 --> 02:00:13,859
um I was hanging out with one of his

2947
02:00:12,118 --> 02:00:15,839
staff

2948
02:00:13,859 --> 02:00:18,059
in 90

2949
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:21,560
what did I speak to I think it was

2950
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:21,560
90 99

2951
02:00:21,658 --> 02:00:27,539
it was 99.

2952
02:00:24,658 --> 02:00:29,879
um guys hanging out with chick again

2953
02:00:27,539 --> 02:00:31,979
um and I know that word Gigolo came up

2954
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,900
in some sort of host someplace right

2955
02:00:31,979 --> 02:00:36,178
that

2956
02:00:33,899 --> 02:00:38,759
um Karen from the Amsterdam hired me as

2957
02:00:36,179 --> 02:00:42,179
a gigolo yeah something about that right

2958
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:43,920
and it's true I mean I [ __ ] Khmer has

2959
02:00:42,179 --> 02:00:47,760
pictures of me wearing a pink [ __ ]

2960
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:49,859
thong what a badass yeah well I wore it

2961
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:52,440
I mean I [ __ ] live yeah that's

2962
02:00:49,859 --> 02:00:54,658
awesome I was working with and I was

2963
02:00:52,439 --> 02:00:56,279
like she's like you're paying for me to

2964
02:00:54,658 --> 02:00:58,319
be here

2965
02:00:56,279 --> 02:01:01,380
um I kind of know why because the years

2966
02:00:58,319 --> 02:01:03,479
before I would go around and [ __ ]

2967
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:05,819
pick up all the [ __ ] cutest [ __ ]

2968
02:01:03,479 --> 02:01:08,939
pot girls from usually all the booths

2969
02:01:05,819 --> 02:01:11,460
other Seasons hence why Tony from sag

2970
02:01:08,939 --> 02:01:13,138
probably doesn't like me very much if he

2971
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:13,859
even remembers this but

2972
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:16,380
um

2973
02:01:13,859 --> 02:01:18,779
but she sold all female apparel because

2974
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:20,880
she had sativa sisters uh bed and

2975
02:01:18,779 --> 02:01:23,639
breakfast in Vancouver right so it was

2976
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:26,099

2977
02:01:23,639 --> 02:01:28,859

2978
02:01:26,099 --> 02:01:30,840
um and she had the amphi MC to seed uh

2979
02:01:28,859 --> 02:01:31,979
seed company so I was like well I can't

2980
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:33,239

2981
02:01:31,979 --> 02:01:36,359

2982
02:01:33,238 --> 02:01:38,459
pink thong under my pants right I wasn't

2983
02:01:36,359 --> 02:01:41,579

2984
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:44,340

thong up a little bit and pull my hands

2987
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:49,980
up a little bit so you could see it and

2988
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:53,480

2989
02:01:49,979 --> 02:01:56,098

2994
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:06,779
more than seeds from that trip but uh

2995

I just found uh

2997
02:02:09,539 --> 02:02:15,539

2998
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:18,779
sell his seat for for him as well

2999
02:02:15,539 --> 02:02:20,519
um I don't think I did much I thought

3000
02:02:18,779 --> 02:02:23,880
you know

3001
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:27,000
um this is totally random but I saw

3002
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:28,679
earlier on your Seed Catalog yeah that

3003
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,359
you were offering that you guys it looks

3004
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:32,760
like you guys did like some like early

3005
02:02:30,359 --> 02:02:34,920
Pearl and some other like reproductions

3006
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:36,960
of those yeah yeah do you have any of

3007
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:40,319
that stuff left I don't I didn't see any

3008
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:41,279
of that so far in my uh my Runnings

3009
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:42,779
um

3010
02:02:41,279 --> 02:02:45,300
I did find the remember we were talking

3011
02:02:42,779 --> 02:02:46,920
about the green Spirit yeah right so I

3012
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:49,980
found that we did a blueberry green

3013
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:52,380
Spirit kind of seed back then

3014
02:02:49,979 --> 02:02:55,019
um green Spirit was Big Bud skunk one

3015
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:58,618
Matt is that what it was yeah I think so

3016
02:02:55,020 --> 02:03:01,560
yeah right yeah it sounds familiar uh

3017
02:02:58,618 --> 02:03:04,500
big bud skunk one I think I think it was

3018
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:06,480
based I think it was that big skunk that

3019
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:07,859
Neville had and then it went and then I

3020
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:09,959
think you were talking about it earlier

3021
02:03:07,859 --> 02:03:10,799
I think big skunk turned into Scentsy

3022
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:13,079
skunk

3023
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,119
yes and then I think since and then it

3024
02:03:13,079 --> 02:03:17,880
needed another rebranding and so it

3025
02:03:15,118 --> 02:03:20,158
became green Spirit you know right I

3026
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:22,380
knew the rebranding part of it where the

3027
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:26,779
name came from

3028
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:26,779
um but you know again

3029
02:03:26,819 --> 02:03:32,158
names or names to a certain degree but

3030
02:03:29,158 --> 02:03:35,098
the Early Girl early Pearl anything that

3031
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:37,439
said early in it we liked we wanted sure

3032
02:03:35,099 --> 02:03:38,880
so when people were coming back if we

3033
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:41,158
knew people were going to Amsterdam like

3034
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:43,980
dude pick up the early Pearl pick up the

3035

3036
02:03:43,979 --> 02:03:50,698

3037
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:53,219
or 50 55 days kind of thing we need that

3038
02:03:50,698 --> 02:03:55,678
for our outdoor right we need for our

3039
02:03:53,219 --> 02:03:58,500
indoor too because we wanted we didn't

3040
02:03:55,679 --> 02:04:02,819
want to [ __ ] grow out

3041
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:05,880
um 14-week [ __ ] trades but for me

3042
02:04:02,819 --> 02:04:07,679
hence why you'll see that you know the

3043
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:10,500
Mexican sativas and all these other

3044
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:13,380
[ __ ] up strains that you just can't

3045
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:14,760
grow people don't grow unfortunately and

3046
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:17,219
stopped growing

3047
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:19,199
unfortunately like yeah where we've got

3048
02:04:17,219 --> 02:04:21,359
we've kind of bred these sativas out of

3049
02:04:19,198 --> 02:04:23,039
what we're you know now we're kicking

3050
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:25,439
ourselves in the ass saying well we need

3051
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:27,359

3054
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:32,760
know there's there's a lot of people

3055
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:34,679
even today there's famous people that

3056
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:38,280
are like they have a hard cut off at

3057
02:04:34,679 --> 02:04:40,920
nine nine or ten weeks is like the upper

3058
02:04:38,279 --> 02:04:42,420
limit of how long most people will let

3059
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:43,560
their strain go

3060
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:46,739
right

3061
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:48,420
um even 12 is rare for most people like

3062
02:04:46,738 --> 02:04:50,218
you tell someone it takes 12 weeks

3063
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:51,719
they're not interested and then there's

3064
02:04:50,219 --> 02:04:54,800
some people who take it to 12 no matter

3065
02:04:51,719 --> 02:04:57,719
what no matter yeah no matter what

3066
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,639
people have their sweet spots yeah they

3067
02:04:57,719 --> 02:05:02,760
do oh that's something else so again

3068
02:04:59,639 --> 02:05:04,980
another [ __ ] because yeah oh there

3069
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:09,000
you go there you go the early Century

3070
02:05:04,979 --> 02:05:09,839
star kind of stuff right again unopened

3071
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,819
um

3072
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:13,619
and you know what's funny about that is

3073
02:05:11,819 --> 02:05:16,859
is that's one of the things that it got

3074
02:05:13,618 --> 02:05:20,339
released I think in 95 or 96 yeah yeah

3075
02:05:16,859 --> 02:05:23,880
and uh Luke will still not reveal what

3076
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:25,800
he what made it yeah oh really no no

3077
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:28,440
won't say a word you won't say a word

3078
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:30,659
even though even though it was 27 years

3079
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:32,519
ago or something like that or 28 years

3080
02:05:30,658 --> 02:05:34,198
ago and it's like so ancient at this

3081
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:36,239
point he still won't be I took this and

3082
02:05:34,198 --> 02:05:38,279
this and made Scentsy stuff yeah nobody

3083
02:05:36,238 --> 02:05:40,618
could possibly remake it either I'm

3084
02:05:38,279 --> 02:05:42,779
gonna try I'll try

3085
02:05:40,618 --> 02:05:45,118
I'll send him a picture of that I'll

3086
02:05:42,779 --> 02:05:47,639
make sure I sell this number and I'm

3087
02:05:45,118 --> 02:05:50,098
going to ask him you know what he made

3088
02:05:47,639 --> 02:05:51,480
now that'd be cool he asked me not to

3089
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:53,279
reveal it I'm not going to reveal it

3090
02:05:51,479 --> 02:05:55,319
yeah of course but

3091
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:57,300
um I would like no I never even thought

3092
02:05:55,319 --> 02:05:59,399
about it I just like [ __ ] I like his

3093
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:02,820
[ __ ] his eye I like what he's looking

3094
02:05:59,399 --> 02:06:04,319
for yeah I love this sidekick uh oh I

3095
02:06:02,819 --> 02:06:05,759
mean I'm not always trying to like throw

3096
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:08,759
him under the bus or anything like oh

3097
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:11,699
yeah but I like Simon from serious seeds

3098
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:14,400
but he's never revealed what AK-47 or

3099
02:06:11,698 --> 02:06:16,559
Kali Mist has in it either yeah and

3100
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:17,939
those things are just as old yeah it's

3101
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:19,560
like come on dude it's been almost three

3102
02:06:17,939 --> 02:06:21,779
decades just tell us what it's not like

3103
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:23,280
I can get how in the mid 90s they were

3104
02:06:21,779 --> 02:06:25,259
like I'm not going to tell you what's in

3105
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:27,359
the secret sauce because I don't want

3106
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:29,159
someone to steal it but now it's been so

3107
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:31,380
long good luck finding the parents

3108
02:06:29,158 --> 02:06:33,719
anyway let's find the ingredients to

3109
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:35,639
make the sauce no there's no way but but

3110
02:06:33,719 --> 02:06:37,079
it probably comes down to is they just

3111
02:06:35,639 --> 02:06:40,079
don't want to admit

3112
02:06:37,079 --> 02:06:42,599
who they got it from who got jobs for

3113
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:44,039
what or just the fact that like oh this

3114
02:06:42,599 --> 02:06:45,960
came from Neville and this came from

3115
02:06:44,039 --> 02:06:48,899
this person or this came from like they

3116
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:50,698
don't they just don't want to say

3117
02:06:48,899 --> 02:06:52,679
um well see I got some of his Belladonna

3118
02:06:50,698 --> 02:06:55,138
too say yeah that's cool oh yeah look at

3119
02:06:52,679 --> 02:06:58,079
that good score I mean it's something

3120
02:06:55,139 --> 02:07:00,659
again what they are and I thought that

3121
02:06:58,079 --> 02:07:02,158
I've sent that to uh to rent because I

3122
02:07:00,658 --> 02:07:04,098
didn't even know we made them fast fear

3123
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:08,158
oh that's cool

3124
02:07:04,099 --> 02:07:09,719
these are this is what we we uh won the

3125
02:07:08,158 --> 02:07:10,920
well when when the college game in

3126
02:07:09,719 --> 02:07:14,819
second or third with it or something

3127
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:17,039
like that placed yeah and it was [ __ ]

3128
02:07:14,819 --> 02:07:19,259
outdoor replaced with that's pretty cool

3129
02:07:17,039 --> 02:07:21,479
right and it wasn't because the pot was

3130
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:23,159
that good I think it's because I was a

3131
02:07:21,479 --> 02:07:27,000
[ __ ] Gigolo [ __ ] that way and it was

3132
02:07:23,158 --> 02:07:29,039
honor the goddess here and I yeah this

3133
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:32,639
is my story why I say Steve stole my

3134
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:33,899
medal is because I hope he sees this and

3135
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:35,699
he's gonna [ __ ] at me and I don't give

3136
02:07:33,899 --> 02:07:39,179
up he's going to laugh at it too because

3137
02:07:35,698 --> 02:07:43,439
he's good they they know it's true we

3138
02:07:39,179 --> 02:07:45,840
grew out the uh in the outdoor field

3139
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:47,339
we grew out all those old Neville

3140
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,779
strains again going by the story I've

3141
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:49,500
been told

3142
02:07:48,779 --> 02:07:53,158
um

3143
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:56,698
the Ortega was a very large part of it

3144
02:07:53,158 --> 02:07:59,579
um because it had the biggest uh uh

3145
02:07:56,698 --> 02:08:01,500
probably history yeah and appeal but

3146
02:07:59,579 --> 02:08:03,658
then there was the the fast fatty the

3147
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:06,420
fast Spear and the Nightingale that were

3148
02:08:03,658 --> 02:08:07,738
these really tall gangly [ __ ] uh

3149
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:10,679
sativas

3150
02:08:07,738 --> 02:08:14,098
well I like to tears I was in the field

3151
02:08:10,679 --> 02:08:16,560
every day working I wanted to smoke

3152
02:08:14,099 --> 02:08:18,119
sativas I didn't want to get stoned I

3153
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:19,139
couldn't afford to get stoned I wanted

3154
02:08:18,118 --> 02:08:22,500
to get high

3155
02:08:19,139 --> 02:08:23,940
so when um when it came time to enter

3156
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,859
the cup

3157
02:08:23,939 --> 02:08:28,019
all those guys

3158
02:08:25,859 --> 02:08:29,279
said nothing they want nothing to do

3159
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:31,320
with the fast Spirit they wouldn't smoke

3160
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:33,420
it didn't get them high I didn't want to

3161
02:08:31,319 --> 02:08:35,519
smoke I didn't smoke the Ortega because

3162
02:08:33,420 --> 02:08:36,719
it got me too stoned yeah I would spoke

3163
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:38,820
to sativa and they're like yeah dude

3164
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:41,039
this doesn't [ __ ] garbage garbage if

3165
02:08:38,819 --> 02:08:45,420
you want to take it take it but you know

3166
02:08:41,039 --> 02:08:47,960
so I took it because I wanted it yeah I

3167
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:51,539
also knew that it was honor the goddess

3168
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:54,539
the girls you know Hillary was part of

3169
02:08:51,539 --> 02:08:56,579
the uh the one of the judges one of her

3170
02:08:54,539 --> 02:08:58,859
Sidekicks I forget her name beautiful

3171
02:08:56,579 --> 02:09:02,639
little blonde girl was

3172
02:08:58,859 --> 02:09:04,738
um was uh was also asked to be a judge

3173
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:07,739
you know and

3174
02:09:04,738 --> 02:09:09,439
I knew that's what they're after it was

3175
02:09:07,738 --> 02:09:13,019
organically grown

3176
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:14,279
outdoor so full sun organically grown

3177
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:16,080
sativa

3178
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:19,979
that's Penny remover

3179
02:09:16,079 --> 02:09:21,479
you know so I we we won now did we win

3180
02:09:19,979 --> 02:09:23,698
because it was best part no we won

3181
02:09:21,479 --> 02:09:26,098
because there was [ __ ] these

3182
02:09:23,698 --> 02:09:27,359
Canadians were dumb enough to [ __ ]

3183
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:29,819
fly

3184
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:33,238
kilos of cannabis in their backpacks

3185
02:09:29,819 --> 02:09:35,158
into [ __ ] Amsterdam

3186
02:09:33,238 --> 02:09:36,000
we didn't have a coffee shop to sell it

3187
02:09:35,158 --> 02:09:39,420
out of

3188
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:41,698
right so we had to sell stickers for 40

3189
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:44,699
guilders and you got a free eighth of

3190
02:09:41,698 --> 02:09:46,079
pot yeah you know and it was a way like

3191
02:09:44,698 --> 02:09:48,779
we were getting in trouble because you

3192
02:09:46,079 --> 02:09:50,399
can't sell pot at the Cannabis Cup right

3193
02:09:48,779 --> 02:09:53,219
it was wherever it was being held I

3194
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:54,719
forget what it's called but um you know

3195
02:09:53,219 --> 02:09:56,279
so we were finding you know buy a

3196
02:09:54,719 --> 02:10:00,179
sticker we sold these one-hitters at

3197
02:09:56,279 --> 02:10:02,579
Shockwave glass made for us and and um

3198
02:10:00,179 --> 02:10:05,579
and it was uh

3199
02:10:02,579 --> 02:10:06,779
it was

3200
02:10:05,579 --> 02:10:08,698
um

3201
02:10:06,779 --> 02:10:10,079
a type of pot that I knew was gonna

3202
02:10:08,698 --> 02:10:11,339
[ __ ]

3203
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:13,800
be

3204
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:15,960
loved by the judges and the story and so

3205
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:16,800
I played up all that and that's I think

3206
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:18,420
why

3207
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:20,279
we won the cup it had nothing to do

3208
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:22,800
really so much with the big in Gray pot

3209
02:10:20,279 --> 02:10:24,979
you know it didn't but it got the girls

3210
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:27,719
dancing

3211
02:10:24,979 --> 02:10:29,819
and that's that's what was selling that

3212
02:10:27,719 --> 02:10:31,739
kind of thing so

3213
02:10:29,819 --> 02:10:34,380
um so yeah we talked about science so I

3214
02:10:31,738 --> 02:10:37,379
kept his chronic right because Simon

3215
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:39,000
when I when I was saying earlier I I did

3216
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:41,039
a little I was invited to talk at the

3217
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,460
Cannabis Cup about Canadian cultivation

3218
02:10:41,039 --> 02:10:46,738
it was mainly supercropping and um

3219
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:49,618
I don't know even what Simon was talking

3220
02:10:46,738 --> 02:10:50,519
about but him and I shared shared a

3221
02:10:49,618 --> 02:10:54,299
stage

3222
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:56,820
and um and I think Steve was invited uh

3223
02:10:54,300 --> 02:11:00,840
when he he was at the cup so they asked

3224
02:10:56,819 --> 02:11:03,179
him to speak as well and um

3225
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:07,139
it's when I picked up the Russian

3226
02:11:03,179 --> 02:11:10,199
because it was the AK-47 was this huge

3227
02:11:07,139 --> 02:11:12,420
deal but he

3228
02:11:10,198 --> 02:11:15,658
kept raving about the Russian and it was

3229
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:16,920
fairly new and I I this is might have

3230
02:11:15,658 --> 02:11:18,539
been a few years old I'm not sure when

3231
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:21,599
it came out but

3232
02:11:18,539 --> 02:11:24,679
I believe it came out in like the mid

3233
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:28,800
late 90s and this would have been 99

3234
02:11:24,679 --> 02:11:32,520
yeah and uh he react and raved about it

3235
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:33,840
so much that uh we brought backseat and

3236
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:35,340
are you talking about the white russian

3237
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:38,340
yeah

3238
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:40,440
and I still growing and I still love it

3239
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:41,699
it's it was one of our it's one of our

3240
02:11:40,439 --> 02:11:44,219
best sellers at the center you have an

3241
02:11:41,698 --> 02:11:46,079
old white russian cut yeah dude yeah

3242
02:11:44,219 --> 02:11:48,719
okay I think it's the [ __ ] the bomb

3243
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:51,719
[ __ ] white russian is a AK-47 by

3244
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:53,099
White Widow it's a it's a good line dude

3245
02:11:51,719 --> 02:11:56,639
it's so I mean the one thing I'll say

3246
02:11:53,099 --> 02:11:58,980
about Simon is that you know he

3247
02:11:56,639 --> 02:12:00,560
basically sold the same six strains for

3248
02:11:58,979 --> 02:12:03,839
like 20 years or something

3249
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:07,440
and uh I think the chronic is terrible

3250
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:09,480
but yeah the bubble gum and the AK-47

3251
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:11,638
and the Kali Mist and the white russian

3252
02:12:09,479 --> 02:12:14,819
are all real like in the other era

3253
02:12:11,639 --> 02:12:16,980
they're all really nice do you know uh

3254
02:12:14,819 --> 02:12:19,198
the XXX

3255
02:12:16,979 --> 02:12:21,238
strength I I mean I know of it but I

3256
02:12:19,198 --> 02:12:22,919
I've never had any experience where is

3257
02:12:21,238 --> 02:12:25,198
it from because I always thought it was

3258
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:27,599
from time because he has his triple X in

3259
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:29,279
the [ __ ] in the logo logo right yeah

3260
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:31,199
yeah I don't know where that can

3261
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:33,059
collects for

3262
02:12:31,198 --> 02:12:35,039
I don't I don't have any not I don't

3263
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:37,020

3264
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:39,319
on that one or whatever but oh man I can

3265
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:42,300
say that that his his

3266
02:12:39,319 --> 02:12:44,880
AK-47 and his Cali mist and white

3267
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:47,279
russian in the 90s yeah they were

3268
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:48,260
phenomenal pot in that era yeah and they

3269
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:50,519
were winning

3270
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:53,699
they were really there he had really

3271
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:55,500
good strengths the um

3272
02:12:53,698 --> 02:12:58,259
again that's how is your phone going to

3273
02:12:55,500 --> 02:13:00,599
die it is but yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna

3274
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:01,739
be here until it just it's I'm like well

3275
02:13:00,599 --> 02:13:02,699
I'm gonna go through I only have a few

3276
02:13:01,738 --> 02:13:04,379
more stuff because you don't care about

3277
02:13:02,698 --> 02:13:06,118
Butch's beaver I don't know what it is

3278
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:08,578
but it's from the state because it has a

3279
02:13:06,118 --> 02:13:09,479
Marlboro [ __ ] symbol on it

3280
02:13:08,578 --> 02:13:14,099
um

3281
02:13:09,479 --> 02:13:17,399
it says Nevada City California

3282
02:13:14,099 --> 02:13:19,319
hmm latitude

3283
02:13:17,399 --> 02:13:22,078
so well I've never even heard of Nevada

3284
02:13:19,319 --> 02:13:23,279
City no I don't know right did we just

3285
02:13:22,078 --> 02:13:26,039
lose him because of his home yeah yeah

3286
02:13:23,279 --> 02:13:26,759
his phone he's all right all right

3287
02:13:26,039 --> 02:13:28,800
um

3288
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:30,000
so then the other things that we get to

3289
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:32,639
is

3290
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:36,060
um oh we were talking about uh with uh

3291
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:38,578
Sol this like this is his

3292
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:41,940
Plum Bud the plumber yeah I remember you

3293
02:13:38,578 --> 02:13:43,019
mentioned it yeah again I'm not sure

3294
02:13:41,939 --> 02:13:45,899
um

3295
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:48,659
what it is I have my speculation but

3296
02:13:45,899 --> 02:13:50,939
after certain conversations it would be

3297
02:13:48,658 --> 02:13:52,799
something that Steve or red might be

3298
02:13:50,939 --> 02:13:55,678
able to

3299
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:59,460
um explain more I have I thought it was

3300
02:13:55,679 --> 02:14:01,440
and I just thought it was a a Fino of a

3301
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:04,679
certain cross that that Steve did that

3302
02:14:01,439 --> 02:14:05,339
you know where the sweet tooth came from

3303
02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:07,679
um

3304
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:09,719
I'm not sure

3305
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:11,099
um and then this one's called blonde

3306
02:14:09,719 --> 02:14:12,139
bastard

3307
02:14:11,099 --> 02:14:17,880
um

3308
02:14:12,139 --> 02:14:19,260
says uh stb M3 which

3309
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:23,219
is

3310
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:26,760
a strawberry blonde that you had

3311
02:14:23,219 --> 02:14:29,520
um in Switzerland and

3312
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:32,039
I thought it was crossed with

3313
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:34,860
the

3314
02:14:32,039 --> 02:14:37,859
uh

3315
02:14:34,859 --> 02:14:39,779
it's whatever the the mail from the uh

3316
02:14:37,859 --> 02:14:42,179
Louis

3317
02:14:39,779 --> 02:14:45,719
which um

3318
02:14:42,179 --> 02:14:48,679
I think this was the tooth so yeah I

3319
02:14:45,719 --> 02:14:48,679
think this was with

3320
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:52,860
and that's where I think the SB stands

3321
02:14:51,179 --> 02:14:55,199
for so I think it's those sweet tooth

3322
02:14:52,859 --> 02:15:00,839
crossed with the strawberry strawberry

3323
02:14:55,198 --> 02:15:04,138
blonde and it says SD stb so sweet tooth

3324
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:06,599
blonde yeah blonde or back cross but it

3325
02:15:04,139 --> 02:15:08,420
has the M3 and maybe maybe I can ask red

3326
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:12,420
he might know because that would be my

3327
02:15:08,420 --> 02:15:13,980
right so it might be the because it if I

3328
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:16,980
remember correctly

3329
02:15:13,979 --> 02:15:20,279
Steve had a a sweet tooth mail

3330
02:15:16,979 --> 02:15:22,138
okay thank you again this would be

3331
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:24,059
better for Steve for Steve or for red

3332
02:15:22,139 --> 02:15:25,500
but they stuck in the corner behind a

3333
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:28,500
fan and [ __ ] hit it and it just

3334
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:30,658
flooded the whole room and and um that's

3335
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:33,000
where you know they made the Louie and

3336
02:15:30,658 --> 02:15:35,098
they made a few other strains yeah at

3337
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,618
least that's right and then sticking

3338
02:15:35,099 --> 02:15:39,840
with his stuff is uh the big Funk and

3339
02:15:37,618 --> 02:15:41,759
the Sweet Tooth number four but these

3340
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:44,460
are these are males from him because

3341
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:47,280
they're actually in uh the core class

3342
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:49,800
how we used to mail them yeah before and

3343
02:15:47,279 --> 02:15:52,500
then the last but not least is the uh

3344
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:54,840
blueberry now very cool where are the

3345
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:57,420
these are coming from that same era just

3346
02:15:54,840 --> 02:16:00,779
judging by what they're packaged in yeah

3347
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:03,779
so judging by the

3348
02:16:00,779 --> 02:16:07,500
uh big funk

3349
02:16:03,779 --> 02:16:09,840
right which is which is uh spice of life

3350
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:10,800
early genetics

3351
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,779
um

3352
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:16,980
what blueberry was coming through then

3353
02:16:12,779 --> 02:16:19,439
and were though how closely DJ was

3354
02:16:16,979 --> 02:16:21,178
working with those guys at that time I

3355
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:27,078
would imagine this is probably from that

3356
02:16:21,179 --> 02:16:27,078
era judging by you know it's um

3357
02:16:27,618 --> 02:16:33,058
they all came in the same envelope from

3358
02:16:30,359 --> 02:16:36,840
the same era kind of thing so it's not

3359
02:16:33,058 --> 02:16:40,920
I don't know if it's uh the 93 you know

3360
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:41,579
but the 93 like I I just keep it is as a

3361
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:44,340
um

3362
02:16:41,579 --> 02:16:45,780
as a mom yeah dude I think it would be

3363
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:48,780
cool to do an open pollination with that

3364
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:50,880
throw the 93 his mom cut in there and

3365
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:53,399
yeah like I had some of his like apple

3366
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:55,799
pie stuff some of the stuff he released

3367
02:16:53,398 --> 02:16:58,260
last year or the year before yeah he

3368
02:16:55,799 --> 02:17:00,000
doesn't even touch that anymore that was

3369
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:03,059
someone else doing it all yeah I

3370
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:06,058
understand that too I understand that uh

3371
02:17:03,058 --> 02:17:07,018
who was doing it but you know the fact

3372
02:17:06,058 --> 02:17:08,879
that

3373
02:17:07,019 --> 02:17:11,579
the uh

3374
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:15,000
you know that what's in it the thing is

3375
02:17:11,579 --> 02:17:15,840
you know do they breed have they bred

3376
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,319
out

3377
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:20,760
What DJ was

3378
02:17:19,319 --> 02:17:22,379
looking for

3379
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:23,639
because now they're breeding for what

3380
02:17:22,379 --> 02:17:26,039
they're looking for

3381
02:17:23,638 --> 02:17:28,379
it's it's just what I'll say is like

3382
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:30,719
after going spinning tens of thousands

3383
02:17:28,379 --> 02:17:33,000
of dollars on blueberry and DJ Short

3384
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:35,398
Stuff and hunting it very specific I

3385
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:37,620
wanted a blueberry plant that looked

3386
02:17:35,398 --> 02:17:40,039
like blueberry purple that smelled like

3387
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:42,719
blueberry jam you know just the whole

3388
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:44,880
and I it didn't find that in anything

3389
02:17:42,718 --> 02:17:47,459
directly from DJ Short I found that from

3390
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:49,138
hybrids of DJ Short Stuff or people that

3391
02:17:47,459 --> 02:17:52,199
worked his lines further that weren't

3392
02:17:49,138 --> 02:17:53,699
him and weren't his son but I found it

3393
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:56,760
and I did find it eventually and other

3394
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:58,320
stuff that had his work in it like you

3395
02:17:56,760 --> 02:18:00,920
couldn't find it without his work in it

3396
02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:00,920
I don't think

3397
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:08,399
my B93 doesn't go uh blue doesn't go

3398
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:10,439
purple but it has that

3399
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:12,420
pint of blueberry not that fake

3400
02:18:10,439 --> 02:18:15,898
blueberry smell but yeah the blueberry

3401
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:16,558
really rich [ __ ] blueberry smell yeah

3402
02:18:15,898 --> 02:18:19,619
um

3403
02:18:16,558 --> 02:18:22,199
and again Jay it comes from that era

3404
02:18:19,620 --> 02:18:24,899
which that that seed I wouldn't be

3405
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:26,519
surprised if I had a few of those seeds

3406
02:18:24,898 --> 02:18:29,398
so I would maybe those seeds are from

3407
02:18:26,519 --> 02:18:32,040
that that early 90s yeah kind of thing

3408
02:18:29,398 --> 02:18:34,619
so but um

3409
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:37,380
that's it for what I kind of pulled out

3410
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:40,139
for you guys except for no I did a a

3411
02:18:37,379 --> 02:18:41,638
sweet tooth blueberry berry berry cross

3412
02:18:40,138 --> 02:18:43,259
because I really like that Berry that's

3413
02:18:41,638 --> 02:18:44,518
awesome I'm not going to get into all

3414
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:47,280
the other stuff because a lot of this

3415
02:18:44,519 --> 02:18:50,760
stuff probably won't really

3416
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:54,659
overly interest uh anybody
