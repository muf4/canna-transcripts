some seeds uh I found a good spot that

66
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,920
was in a dry wash so you know the soil

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,739
was good but uh it had a Springs fed

68
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,539
little little runoff above right so I

69
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,219
had water that I could bring down and

70
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,859
everything turned out good it was a it

71
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,378
was really beneficial that it was a a

72
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,180
long hot summer because you know again

73
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:56,419
you know I didn't I didn't know much

74
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,599

75
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:03,119

80
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,079
November well we only saw two reins

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,400
during that entire time yeah that's nice

82
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,959
yeah right you know I didn't even know

83
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,300
how lucky I was until much later

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,939
obviously yeah yeah of course but uh

85
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,680

86
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,378
um you know I got it I got it all down

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,700

88
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,439
way back in the mountains way back in

89
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,939
the Hills right so it was all you know

90
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,180
packing it myself packing in the dirt

91
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,019
myself doing all that

92
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,760
and uh

93
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,099
you know at that point man you know

94
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,979

99
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:58,259
it was all just vehicle seeds and shake

100
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,480

splash in my neighborhood right with my

102
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,340

really really well

135
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,040
a good good little little story from

136
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,680
those days was uh I was back in this um

137
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,379
in this park right it was like a state

138
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,319
park or County Park and they had miles

139
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:21,839
and miles of trails so I went way back

140
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,079
down this Trail got off of the county

141
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,138
land into some other land and uh there

142
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,879
was some some brush and some trees and

143
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,400
so you know I would do like six plants

144
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,139
in each area yeah so I got a spot man I

145
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,359
had six plants growing

146
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,759
and I always had an alternative way to

147
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,740
walk I would never walk directly to my

148
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,720
grill right sure so I walked and it was

149
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,759
up above the site right it was you know

150
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,620
maybe maybe 100 feet up above the site

151
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,600
and I'm sitting up there in this little

152
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,019
spot man I'm having my lunch looking

153
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,400
down and I see some movement right and

154
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,719
I'm like oh [ __ ] what the hell is that

155
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,879
man I don't think maybe it's you know a

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,520
deer or something right no man somebody

157
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,579
some dude gets up from what he was

158
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:06,719
hiding goes and obviously goes and takes

159
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:08,459
a leak and then comes back yeah and then

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,520
I see somebody else right trying to be

161
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:14,399
all stealthy in the bushes too well you

162
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,659
know cops obviously cops man because

163
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,299
they're hiding

164
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,580
yeah so I was like well [ __ ] this I'm

165
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,199

yeah and I have three I had three more

257
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,620
spots so it didn't matter yeah but that

258
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,319
was that was some funny [ __ ] man what

259
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,539
was the old um the old thing like plant

260
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,740
one for you plant one for thieves plant

261
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:54,899
one for cops type you know yeah yep yep

262
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,299
and it was also plant plant another one

263
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,580
for the Wildlife oh that's true yeah you

264
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,939
got rabbits and deers and rabbits and

265
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,060
kangaroo rats and you name it bro they

266
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,800
were taking it right but I did it right

267
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:10,018
I would take uh chicken wire

268
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,759
yeah and I would make a basket you know

269
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,580
what I mean and then the basket would be

270
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,139
two feet above the soil line you know

271
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,639
what I mean so now you got a basket

272
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,278
that's like two and a half feet down

273
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,500
into your hole that you dug and then you

274
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,179
got a two feet up above and I would take

275
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,559
it and you know you always I would

276
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,259
always take off the bottom branches

277
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:31,619
because you know that's just drill 101

278
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,539
and uh you know then fold it in a little

279
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,299
bit so that it was maybe

280
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:39,419
you know eight to ten inches around

281
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:41,399
around the the uh the main stem yeah

282
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,860
yeah you mean so that stops rabbits it

283
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,778
stops kangaroo rats that stops Gophers

284
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,500
you know it's not gonna stop the deer

285
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:51,419
but yeah those [ __ ] girdle like they

286
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,679
they strip the bottom base of your

287
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,599
plants for people that don't know like

288
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,859
rats will just strip it and they do it

289
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,540
once and it'll kill the whole plant

290
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,440
instantly well they do that on purpose

291
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,319
because they want to knock the plant

292
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,279
over

293
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,420
they can only reach so many of the

294
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,700
leaves down low

295
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,879
I didn't realize that I was like why did

296
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,140
they always just Target That Base sucks

297
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,240
yeah they want they want to knock it

298
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,759
down that makes sense that's how it does

299
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,659
yeah and then you don't have the leaves

300
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,220
off of it man [ __ ] rabbits man

301
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:21,539

yeah let it soak it up do that a couple

326
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,379
times man and now you're you're Pete and

327
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,560
all your Forest product is all you know

328
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,838
nice and hydrated again no no that's

329
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,719
actually really good advice too

330
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,680
yeah you know it worked out I mean not

331
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,480
many people are Gorilla growing anymore

332
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,299
they do I mean you have some a lot of

333
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,560
people who watch this show do

334
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,199
really

335
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,419
yeah so this is good advice man this is

336
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,920
a good advice because you know once you

337
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,778
get out once you get back there man it's

338
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,338
you know it's it's easy to hydrate it

339
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:52,740
and it's just impossible to get it back

340
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,000
there right it's crazy right and you

341
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,620
know I did a lot of I did a lot of crazy

342
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,019
different gorilla girls man I did some

343
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,639
that were you know all the way up on the

344
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,620
top of a ridge where the water source it

345
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,379
was down at the bottom and what I did

346
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,060
was I just took old water beds and took

347
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:07,919
them to the top of the Ridge and then I

348
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,059
would get down below and I had a uh an

349
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,338
OG

350
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:14,399
um foot pump that I hooked up to a

351
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,740
bicycle uh pedals you know what I mean

352
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,019
yeah yeah and then I would just sit down

353
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,360
and just you know

354
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:25,339
and pedaling and fill everything up man

355
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,440
fill it all up and it worked out well

356
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,180
good the water beds because there was a

357
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,980
uh I don't know if you know mad Jag he

358
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:34,138
used to be on the forums I see mag and

359
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,600
he was an old uh grower back into a

360
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,759
gorilla grower in the late 70s did the

361
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,700
first big skunk one grows that he gave

362
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,319
me this old this old catalog Vlog and it

363
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,200
was for gorilla Growers and it was from

364
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,440
the late 70s early 80s and it had these

365
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,720
big inflatable like thing like basically

366
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,940
waterbed innards that you would fill up

367
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,860
with water for a gorilla growing but a

368
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,620
waterbed is perfect it's the same [ __ ]

369
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,639
just pump it down this is perfect and

370
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,659
then I would just cover them with leaves

371
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,240
you know what I mean cover the water

372
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,519
beds with leaves and then I would grow I

373
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,399
would grow down the backside the south

374
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,100
facing side of these ridges right

375
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,659
um because uh you know it was uh I was

376
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,940
grown in an area that had a decent

377
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,439
amount of hunters but if you know if the

378
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,180
incline is as such you don't have to

379
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,500
worry about hunters going down there

380
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,539
yeah they don't want them anymore around

381
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,458
there yeah and it was I mean the incline

382
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,838
on this this particular spot that I was

383
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,578
doing that at

384
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,339
um I would I would actually tie off a

385
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:31,939
rope to a tree at the top and then just

386
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:34,200
work my way across

387
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,660
you know what I mean because yeah it

388
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,579
worked out well this is long before we

389
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,860
had camp or any of that didn't have to

390
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,778
worry about helicopters or anybody

391
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,778
coming swooping in on your [ __ ] blah

392
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:48,360
blah blah when Camp came in

393
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:50,939
I was actually I would get on a south

394
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,579
facing Hillside and then tuck my plants

395
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,139
up underneath the oak trees yeah right

396
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:58,138
so that you know you still get that

397
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,299
south facing you know good sunlight on

398
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:02,519
your plants but they're kind of stealthy

399
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,719
up underneath the oak trees yeah so you

400
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,500
really couldn't you really couldn't see

401
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,778
them

402
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,440
and I never you know I lost a I lost a

403
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:12,838
few plants here and there you know to uh

404
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:17,040
to people because you know as I go in if

405
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,720
I saw any recent tracks or areas that

406
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,500
were apparent that people were moving

407
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,500
around in that area

408
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:27,359
it's not worth it man it was just not

409
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,159
worth the prison time bro yeah some

410
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
people get that greed and and think

411
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,838
about all the work and just like I can't

412
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,459
walk but that's what keeps people safe

413
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,139
you know you got to be smart you got to

414
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,179
be smarter I wasn't I wasn't prepared to

415
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,120
go to prison man that's you know using

416
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:45,419
my own use my instincts and my intuition

417
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,578
bro I kept myself out of out of jail you

418
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:49,379

419
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:50,939
mentioned your name Kendo coming you

420
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:52,860
know from a karate background real quick

421
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,540
real quick can you tell us a little bit

422
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,620
about some of that karate background

423
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:57,480
because I know people are going to want

424
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,419
to want me to ask that so when I first

425
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,100
started man it was uh I got in a lot of

426
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,198
fights as a kid right yeah wearing

427
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,659
glasses you know I wouldn't take any

428
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,679
[ __ ] I grew up in Oakland and so when I

429
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,078
moved to this little town called

430
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,278
Milpitas a lot of farm boys who thought

431
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,778
they were tough right and they really

432
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,519
weren't tough

433
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:16,078
um and so I got in a lot of fights right

434
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,299
like Bakersfield

435
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,979
pardon it's like Bakersfield all the

436
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:22,740
farm guys and yeah that's how I grew up

437
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,560
yeah oh yeah bro and so you know my

438
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,959
parents put me into karate uh in hopes

439
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,879
that it would teach me discipline and

440
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,919
restraint keep me from fighting right

441
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,139
yes

442
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,240
it worked to a degree right yeah it

443
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,159
worked to a degree but it also didn't

444
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,500
work to another degree right I didn't

445
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,899
get into trouble anymore right because

446
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,480
people were afraid to talk [ __ ] and turn

447
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,578
me in right but I started off doing uh I

448
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,139
started off doing Taekwondo right and

449
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:50,458
that's where the Kendo came in right

450
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,440

martial arts and and the history that

479
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,679
like this fascinates me this part of it

480
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,980
fascinates me you know I started off as

481
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:11,340
a Shotokan kid at way of Japan here with

482
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,558
a Ballard of a Sensei yeah but I was a

483
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,899
kid like I got put in the same

484
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,579
same reasons parents saw me fighting a

485
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,620
bunch and thought wanted me to have some

486
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,779
restraint but what it taught me was you

487
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,000
don't just unload on everyone you unload

488
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:25,558
on those that are [ __ ] and and

489
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,720
bigger than you you never fight someone

490
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,099
smaller than you you know [ __ ] like that

491
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,298
that's what that's what the discipline I

492
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:32,879
learned but I eventually got kicked out

493
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:35,400
for street fighting yeah I ended up

494
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,640
becoming the bully of the bullies yeah

495
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,100
yeah that's what I did yeah

496
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,140
the guys were bullies man I I take it to

497
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:46,439
them you know what I mean

498
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,900
I do because I see that you took that to

499
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,298
the forums too and as we Adventure into

500
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,179
there this is why like

501
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,440
I I really for people that don't know

502
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,600
like

503
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,480
I have spent a lot of time on the forums

504
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:03,779
myself but Kendo was on the forums

505
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,400
before my time and there are throughout

506
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,259
the history there hasn't been a lot of

507
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,100
people that have given pushback to

508
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:13,980
scammers the Liars to con artists Kendo

509
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:17,519
was the pre-premet right long before I

510
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,798
existed Kendo was holding it down hard

511
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,720
so I really want to go into some of that

512
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:23,038
too because it it's special moments

513
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,480
important moments and there wasn't a lot

514
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,819
of dudes who had the balls to do it

515
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,620
because it's not fun being that person

516
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,379
but it's necessary

517
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:33,719
well you know man um being at it for

518
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,520
such a long time I mean I was a I was a

519
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,319
web guy in the 80s before the internet

520
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,558

524
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,600
was nothing like that right yeah and uh

525
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,179
I learned how to troll from guys at that

526
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,619
time right

527
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:54,240

overdrow right

649
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,640
so now let's start with the forums man

650
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,558
um

651
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,900
overgrowth was really interesting to me

652
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,538
right because you know prior to that it

653
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,059
was you know I I had not had exposure to

654
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:52,619
you know just outright talking about

655
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:55,259
[ __ ] online yeah no no not at all and so

656
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:56,239
when I started at overgrow it was like a

657
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,819
one

658
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,159
2001. and uh

659
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:04,500
and uh I just learned

660
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,120
I learned for a little over a year you

661
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,798
know what I mean just learning doing

662
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,199
things don't do that you know don't want

663
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,240
to interact yet but like I think that's

664
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,058
a lot of the old school method that you

665
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,159
sit down you listen and you learn before

666
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:20,099
you jump in so you don't look like an

667
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,720
ass you know that's not how most people

668
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,240
operate

669
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,298
and so like you said well I started I

670
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,500
started noticing a lot of

671
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:30,599
inconsistencies you know what I mean

672
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,538
yeah and my gut and intuition was

673
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,339
telling me you know this guy's a scammer

674
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:37,919
yeah this person's scamming that's

675
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:40,319
that's [ __ ] that's not right you

676
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,538
know but I still hadn't started posting

677
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,220
right yeah so

678
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:45,658
as time went on I was like all right I'm

679
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,339
just going to post some stuff right and

680
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:49,260
and I started actually posting on the

681
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,359
political forums that's where I started

682
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,278
posting right because you know I'm you

683
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,500
know me I'm a political guy oh yeah I

684
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,240
can't help it man but uh

685
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,919
you know after I got my legs you know

686
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,558
from posting in the political forums you

687
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,299
know I felt comfortable and uh I started

688
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:04,678
going after some of these guys and

689
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,139
pointing out that you know I thought

690
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,080
they were scammers and you know I didn't

691
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,600
trust what they were saying and at that

692
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,399
point I started getting blowback from

693
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,859
the moderators you know what I mean

694
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,500
because yeah these guys well these guys

695
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,778
were they had they had people fooled you

696
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,538
know everybody thought yeah the coolest

697
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:26,880
nicest most friendly guys or they were

698
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:28,919
people that were so much in need you

699
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,460
know what I mean yeah my whole world

700
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,440
fell apart and yeah yeah yeah yeah and

701
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,298
as you know the Forum back then yeah

702
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,519
everybody wanted to help everybody right

703
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:40,558
always yeah and it was cool right and I

704
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,298
I helped a lot of people right it was a

705
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,759
small community people that cared about

706
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:46,259
each other absolutely but when your gut

707
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,298
you know when you're intuition and your

708
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:51,058
instinct you know sets an alarm off

709
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:53,038
right I trust that [ __ ] big time yeah I

710
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:54,839
did so I would start questioning these

711
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,339
guys you know tell me tell me more tell

712
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,778
me more if I'm gonna do something for

713
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,639
you you're going to explain to me how

714
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:01,380
this came about that's not making a lot

715
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,480
of sense to me so then people would come

716
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,559
back oh you're a dick you're a chump why

717

so at that exactly exactly so at that

720
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,399
point now I'm already raising you know

721
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:16,740

722

was like all right whatever whatever's

724
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:25,260
clever I don't care man yeah so then you

725
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:27,440
know I'm thinking about how I'm going to

726
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:30,599
shake things up a little bit

727
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,860
how am I going to shake things up over

728
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:39,058
here man so I posted up a thread called

729
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:41,658
IP on my plants the classic even even

730
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:45,538
during my time

731
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:47,460
looking down right on my plants and I'm

732
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:50,038
holding a water bottle out of sight

733
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,360
right with a hole in the front of it and

734
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,278
I'm squirting the plants down but it

735
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,918
looks like I'm actually peeing on my

736
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,659
plants right on your plants yeah the

737
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,659
whole the whole premise of the thread

738
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:03,059
was about how much people were using

739
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,159
urea products yeah you know what I mean

740
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:06,960
and it was just a joke you know what I

741
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,419
mean yeah yeah well yeah urea you know

742
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,058
what I mean and it was just a joke

743
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,919
and before you knew it man it just

744
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:16,200

mean literally just started taking off

750
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:32,278
and uh by the end of that thread it had

751
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:34,679
there was only a couple of other threads

752
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,740
that were even close right but it had

753
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,798
the most activity of any thread on

754
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,859

757
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:51,778
was a joke dude some people got it right

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,340
and most people didn't most people

759
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:56,339

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,558
feeling real comfortable I'm like

763
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,298
[ __ ] I'm gonna start commenting on

everything I don't care I'm just

765

commenting all over the place and I'm

766
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,500
gaining all kinds of people and friends

767
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:14,399
and doing this and that and uh I gained

768
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,380
the the site of the sharks tank

769
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,480
okay do you remember the Shark Tank no

770
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:23,000
no before my time

771
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,740
so the sharks tank was uh was like the

772
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,179
the spot for overgrow where they could

773
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,058
send the trolls

774
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:32,820
it was a place where they could have

775
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:36,240
uh uncensored

776
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,740
um content yeah without without having

777
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,599
to do that and they could you know they

778
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,339
would send the trolls to the sharks tank

779
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,199
right yeah so there was a lot of guys

780
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:44,278
over there that were

781
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,038

moderators and the moderated

901
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:43,199
and it was a it was a vision into what

902

moderation truly is you know what I mean

903
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,618
how you moderate people right what

904
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:50,760
you're supposed to be what it's supposed

905
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:53,460
to be right and then about who and what

906
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,000
moderators are supposed to do and about

907
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,740
what we saw at overgrow and at cannabis

908
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,838
world as well right

909
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:03,899
that uh they really weren't moderators

910
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,159
they were just ego ego people who you

911
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,680
know would go after people they didn't

912
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,179
like and uh you know let the people that

913
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,699
they did like get away with whatever

914
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:13,559
they wanted to because

915
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:15,239
you know how it is bro it's still the

916

same it doesn't it doesn't change it

917
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,679

918
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,060
moderated those of us who are under

919
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:24,000

lot of visualization a lot of that it

922
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:30,239
opens people's eyes a lot of people

923
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,920
don't even put time into thinking or

924
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,699
understanding the psychology behind it

925
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,680

00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,019
I can run circles around oh yeah 90 of

930
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,579
these people right I learn them it's

931
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,960
like the game of chess right it really

932
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,240
is like a game of chess right and

933
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,358
they're all playing checkers yeah and

934
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,459
psychologically you know on uh on a

935
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,559
website when you're on a website people

936
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,179
are at their keyboard and so it's their

937
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:00,119
own little world right and so they're ID

938
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:02,039
their base comes out right they can't

939
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,320
help but show their base and who they

940
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,079
truly are and it's very easy to

941
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:11,280
manipulate people I developed a uh I

942
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:14,339
developed a means by which to deal with

943
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,760
that [ __ ] and post called Web Foo

944
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,679
I love it yeah and it was uh it was

945
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,680
based on schopenhower's 31 ways to win

946
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:25,980
an argument yeah and Sun sues are the

947
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:28,980
war part of War yep right and so and it

948
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,260
it works out all the [ __ ] time I bet

949
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,880
it does

950
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,520
make them paint themselves into a corner

951
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,780
and then watch them you know you can see

952
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,280
it right away when they figure out that

953
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,839
they painted themselves into a corner

954
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,579
right they start stumbling they start

955
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,519
trying to figure out how to do this and

956
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,900
do that right

957
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:49,079
with that moderation on the moderated

958
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:51,660
post I um I got a lot of those

959
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,640
moderators to paint themselves into a

960
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:54,719
corner straight up because they would

961
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:56,159
come in and it'd be like oh that's

962
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,618
that's [ __ ] I don't do that I don't

963
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,838

973
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,680
instance it's hard for me to be able to

974
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:24,599
see any difference between this that and

975
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,000
the other you know when you say you're a

976
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,800
modder you're actually moderating the

977
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,940
way that a moderator is supposed to

978
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,099
moderate

979
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,139
you're not doing it by example so

980
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,119
explain to me where you're doing this

981
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:38,400
and just yeah so many of them bro

982
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,099
literally bro I got I got these guys to

983
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,858
where they they hated me they they oh I

984
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:45,420
bet that can get dangerous that can get

985
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:47,338
dangerous More Than People realize

986
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,780
though well you know I'm not I'm not

987
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:50,820
scared of nothing no I'm just talking

988
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,220
about like as far as people that are

989
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,380
snitchy that that's the scary one yeah

990
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:57,598
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah you can you get

991
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,960
snitched on man nowadays you get slotted

992
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,359
right that's what I mean that's it's

993
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,619
horrible with where it's gone today as

994
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:05,578
far as like because back in the day like

995
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,599
sometimes you'd run into these people

996
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,300
and you fist fight and that's over

997
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,880
that's cool but this other [ __ ] is not

998
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,680
that's that that's not in our Playbook

999
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,838
we don't have those roles to run that

1000
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,759
way so it's like they get this Dominion

1001
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,279
they always have that upper hand that

1002
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,079
they can do that oh yeah bro and I mean

1003
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,880
I I can tell you I had multiple people

1004
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,980
you know what I mean they would they

1005
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,358
would confront me because you know I've

1006
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,519

1007
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,819

1008
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,820
you know

1009
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,320
there I was like what yeah we can do it

1010
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,460
and uh you know I've been confronted

1011
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,619
there and it's like hey you know we can

1012
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,838

1013
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,880
couple guys were pretty damn big you

1014
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:49,380

1018
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:57,960

right people coming over staying on the

1030
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,239

1033
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,079

something like that we'll use a lot of

1698
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:38,400
other things that I don't find appealing

1699

1721
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,280

within the flower available resources

1724
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:35,760
within the root zone right you can't

1725
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:37,679
flush a plant right yeah it's a

1726

popping old seeds I mean you never

2071
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:55,679
really want everything to be hyper

[ __ ] tribe and weren't like in those

2091
01:20:35,819 --> 01:20:40,979
early on days online days where where

2092
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,079
not everyone in the world was online so

2093
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:44,939
it was it was a camaraderie between

2094
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:49,559
people who understood that kind of

2095
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:52,379
community and tribe so yeah that's

2096
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,360
that's that was a lot for a lot of

2097
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:57,179
people I was just lurking to just

2098
01:20:54,359 --> 01:21:00,420
beginning to lurk in 2006 you know it

2099
01:20:57,179 --> 01:21:02,760
took a it took a couple months for even

2100
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:04,460
even a small amount of us to find each

2101
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,780
other right and it was like

2102
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:09,480
it was an icy mag right because I see

2103
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:12,059
mag was just starting yep at that time

2104
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:14,279
right and uh

2105
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:17,179

01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:17,179
off right when

2107
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,960

they they kicked off right then right it

2109
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:27,600

01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:31,800
indoor stuff too to do a fade as well

2243
01:26:28,738 --> 01:26:33,119
because I started reducing the time you

2244
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,980
know what I mean I let it get you like

2245
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:37,139
that that six and a half seventh week

2246
01:26:34,979 --> 01:26:39,479
and I start reducing the time by like

2247
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:40,219
five minutes yeah I mean five more

2248
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:42,839
minutes

2249
01:26:40,219 --> 01:26:44,279
yeah so then the plant the plant starts

2250
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,800
to recognize that it needs to do what

2251
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:49,198
it's supposed to do

2252
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:51,360
you keep that 12 going the whole time

2253
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:53,579
um the plant doesn't recognize it's time

2254
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:56,639
to die until it's time to [ __ ] die

2255
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:58,859
and then you know it it goes but you can

2256
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:01,199
you can initiate that really nice fade

2257
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:03,359
by reducing your time a little exactly a

2258
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:05,519
single day especially with sativas that

2259
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:08,399
light the [ __ ] long hours they like

2260
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,380
shorter light hours at the end there's

2261
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:13,019
an idea with my sativas too right to

2262
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:15,900
keep them from herming or acting real

2263
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:18,719
stupid is you take and instead of

2264
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:21,479
slapping them into 1212 you reduce the

2265
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:22,859
you reduce the time yeah you know over a

2266
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:24,718
couple of week period right you just

2267
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:27,839
keep reducing it

2268
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:30,060
and then get to that 12-12 period that's

2269
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,460
great advice I mean most achieve is even

2270
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:34,739
if you get it down to a 14 and then

2271
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,539
stick it down an hour after that you

2272
01:27:34,738 --> 01:27:38,399
know what I mean an hour one week and

2273
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:42,000
then hour the next week I'm sure it's

2274
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:44,339
gonna increase your 12 to 14 week flower

2275
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,079
time but I mean if you're growing if

2276
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,100
you're growing a true tie you know what

2277
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:50,340
I mean

2278
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:52,139
like yeah that's a lot because there's a

2279
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:56,360
lot indoors how was that one how was

2280
01:27:52,139 --> 01:27:56,359
that one bro man it was

2281
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:02,219
so what I did was I started it in a nice

2282
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:05,359
big [ __ ] pot right yeah and I'm

2283
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:09,119
letting it grow and that [ __ ] is just

2284
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:11,099
it's [ __ ] going nuts so I flour it

2285
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:13,559
and it goes even more it's stretching

2286
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:15,600
even more yeah stretching even more so I

2287
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:18,840
put it up against the wall and I put

2288
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,600
this this uh you know 4x4 cattle fencing

2289
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,920
across this entire wall and then just

2290
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,739
weaved it

2291
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:28,260
yeah [ __ ] cattle fencing you know

2292
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:30,259
what I mean yeah and Let It Go and Let

2293
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:35,280
it Go and Let It Go dude

2294
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:36,980
16 [ __ ] weeks later bro I got a

2295
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:41,819

that's right yeah do you remember the

2317

2318
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:37,100
development oh yeah dude it was uh it

2319
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:37,099
was real it was real

2320
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:42,960
it wasn't Piney it was kind of

2321
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:45,960
kind of sweet a little bit a little bit

2322
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:48,420
sweet but it was more along the lines of

2323
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:52,039
like uh yeah what what

2324
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:52,039
what to repeat what I call that

2325
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:58,159
because it wasn't like my name

2326
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,158
it wasn't terpen lane or

2327
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:03,600
it's kind of hard to describe to be

2328
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:06,539
honest to be honest yeah that's how I've

2329
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:09,000
heard it is it had a little bit it was

2330
01:30:06,539 --> 01:30:11,279
sweet it was a little sweet to it

2331
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,920
um a little Savory you know what I mean

2332
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:15,059
yeah not like not like meat you know I

2333
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,920
mean I've had plenty of strands that

2334
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:18,719
were like meaty but it wasn't like meat

2335
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:21,119
it was a combination it was a

2336
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:23,039
combination later on people said gelat

2337
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:24,479
was like dead meat that was the the one

2338
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:26,399
description I was like

2339
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:29,399
it didn't make sense for a tie to be

2340
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:32,039
dead meat smelling not Savory I could

2341
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:34,019

01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:57,060
was like you know we're gonna we're

2402
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,980
gonna start a site right we're gonna

2403
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:01,860
we're gonna get this going

2404
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:04,099
and so Skitty approached me because he

2405
01:33:01,859 --> 01:33:07,920
was super impressed with

2406
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:09,719
the moderator moderation and the

2407
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,179
moderated right

2408
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:15,359
and because I had laid out you know not

2409
01:33:12,179 --> 01:33:18,840
only did I point out each aspect of the

2410
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:21,359
moderation situation but I also laid out

2411
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:22,380
a a

2412
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:25,500
um

2413
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:27,960
scenario you know what I mean I laid out

2414
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:30,479
a means by which I thought that a site

2415
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:32,340
would be successful you know what I mean

2416
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:35,519
without all the [ __ ] right

2417
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:38,940
and uh you know it entailed um

2418
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:40,320
you know Anonymous moderators because

2419
01:33:38,939 --> 01:33:41,339
you know if you're anonymous now you're

2420
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:42,599
not gonna get a big head people aren't

2421
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:46,199
gonna you know what I mean try to kiss

2422
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:48,300
your ass and treat you a certain way

2423
01:33:46,198 --> 01:33:49,919
um you know there was you know no you

2424
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:54,139
don't you don't ban people you simply

2425
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,139
limit the you know their their videos

2426
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:59,520
so you limit their visibility you limit

2427
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:01,559
their their scope of what they can what

2428
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,840
they can actually do

2429
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,820
um you know and several other things so

2430
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,980
you asked me to help put the site

2431
01:34:05,819 --> 01:34:10,679
together yeah so I helped them put the

2432
01:34:07,979 --> 01:34:12,718
side together we uh you know we we did a

2433
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:14,039
bunch of stuff and and it was it was a

2434
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,439
good site for a while right it really

2435
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:18,300
was it was a good site for a while and

2436
01:34:16,439 --> 01:34:20,279
then uh

2437
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:23,840
the um

2438
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:26,579
the moderators just started acting

2439
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:29,699
statelicos dude the moderator started

2440
01:34:26,579 --> 01:34:32,300
acting stupid and they weren't happy

2441
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:35,399
because they weren't getting the

2442
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:37,679
recognition that they felt they deserved

2443
01:34:35,399 --> 01:34:41,638
you know what I mean yeah

2444
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:44,639
um they weren't happy because

2445
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:46,139
um they weren't getting anything for the

2446
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,179
moderating they were doing

2447
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:51,840
so they allowed them to become part

2448
01:34:48,179 --> 01:34:53,158
owners and remove their anonymity

2449
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,319
so as soon as they removed their

2450
01:34:53,158 --> 01:34:58,279
anonymity program just it started going

2451
01:34:55,319 --> 01:35:00,899
downhill right and a lot of the OG's

2452
01:34:58,279 --> 01:35:03,359
just started leaving because they were

2453
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:05,339
getting a bunch of [ __ ] right you can't

2454
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:08,339
you can't say anything

2455
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:10,440
um it started becoming you know like the

2456
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:12,900
world we live in now right yeah you know

2457
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:14,158
a lot of people that were uh a part of

2458
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:15,960
different

2459
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:19,259
um

2460
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:22,560
social dynamics yeah I mean they started

2461
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:26,039
really pushing their agenda on the site

2462
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:28,199
um pushing people uh into corners

2463
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:30,420
and so a lot of people started leaving

2464
01:35:28,198 --> 01:35:33,779
and then you know I

2465
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:35,819

2527
01:37:45,779 --> 01:37:49,819
um

2528
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:52,679
recently I got into a little scuffle

2529
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:54,960
with one of the original people that

2530
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:57,300
created the site sure

2531
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,698
um they like to talk [ __ ] they have

2532
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:01,440
certain they have certain ideals and and

2533
01:37:59,698 --> 01:38:03,960
ways that they think about stuff that I

2534
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:05,939
don't agree with and you know we we

2535
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:09,658
talked a bunch of [ __ ] to each other

2536
01:38:05,939 --> 01:38:12,299
and the next thing you know they put out

2537
01:38:09,658 --> 01:38:14,399
a post on the Cabana

2538
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:16,260
saying that I got arrested by the app

2539
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:18,359
blah blah blah blah blah

2540
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:21,539
so then they said for for security

2541
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:24,019
concerns we're going to delete Kindle

2542
01:38:21,539 --> 01:38:24,019
oh

2543
01:38:25,319 --> 01:38:31,099
yeah dude and so you know I would tell

2544
01:38:27,899 --> 01:38:33,960
people at this point you know

2545
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:36,600
if you're going to be on the Cabana be

2546
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,119
real careful right because yeah to me

2547
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:41,100
don't do that [ __ ] to other people

2548
01:38:38,119 --> 01:38:42,960
listening you know they uh also they

2549
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,400
know that someone was doing you know

2550
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,658
what I mean yeah but they know what

2551
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:46,638
people are doing to DMS unless they're

2552
01:38:45,658 --> 01:38:49,198
reading them

2553
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:50,639
I mean that was so silly that they came

2554
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:52,019
out and said that you know what I mean

2555
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:53,460
oh yeah they're doing this in private

2556
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:55,199
messages because that was one of the

2557
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:57,300
that was one of the points that I

2558
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:58,799
brought up was how would you know if

2559
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,920
unless you're reading people's private

2560
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,920
messages

2561
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:06,179
into a corner right yep and I was like

2562
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:08,039

01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:28,020
every single Forum nowadays has a seed

2573
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:30,500
bank attached to it and that comes with

2574

gonna tell you the truth I mean do you

2747
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:57,239
ask me questions here right and you know

2748
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,279
someone you give me a little blowback

2749
01:45:57,238 --> 01:46:02,218
you know what I mean but

2750
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:04,618
you know these are these are things that

2751
01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:05,579
uh you know other people probably could

2752
01:46:04,618 --> 01:46:09,299
get

2753
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:10,920
um some good uh some good Knowledge from

2754
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:13,020
that's the whole reason we started this

2755
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:14,819
and you know we get bloke one thing that

2756
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:16,619
that my co-partner didn't realize was

2757
01:46:14,819 --> 01:46:19,079
that by digging into cannabis history

2758
01:46:16,618 --> 01:46:20,399
just the genetic side just looking at

2759
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:22,500
the genetic side and trying to start

2760
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:25,500
putting some of these pieces together he

2761
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:26,880
didn't realize how much blowback he was

2762
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:29,698
going to get because from his aspect

2763
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:31,500
he's just a historian you know but

2764
01:46:29,698 --> 01:46:33,599
you're cutting into agendas and money

2765
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:35,460
streams things that people have attached

2766
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,380
deeply to their their lives and

2767
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:40,260
character that aren't true

2768
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:43,260

2769
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:46,199
