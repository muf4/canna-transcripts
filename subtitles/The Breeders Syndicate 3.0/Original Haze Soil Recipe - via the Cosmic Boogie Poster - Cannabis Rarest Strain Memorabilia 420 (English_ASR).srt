1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,759
what's up Syndicate crowd here we have

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:06,359
the original Haze poster trying to keep

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,199
myself out of reflection but this is

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,519
behind archival glass sealed and it's a

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,558
reason I haven't made reproduction

6
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,080
posters it's going to cost a lot to uh

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,878
get it yanked out of this scanned and

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,439
all that so my reflection is going to be

9
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:19,600
a part of it I apologize I don't want it

10
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,960
there but you're going to have to see

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,640
the shape of my ugly head behind it what

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,800
we have here is the original Haze Cosmic

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,118
Boogie poster this one was sourced bya

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,759
granddaddy mic um I believe this was

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:35,238
given out at the Hempfest 2013 as an

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,280
award and then I purchased it from

17
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:41,238
someone who won the won the uh

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,840
contest Mike owns the Lion Share of

19
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:47,238
these posters and for a while he was

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,480
selling reproductions no longer is um on

21
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,919
that page for the reproductions he broke

22
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:53,398
down what some of the meanings were

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,239
behind some of this stuff or at least

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,840
gave some insight to it and I found some

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,640
of it Illuminating so I'm going to go

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,359
through even though I've done a video on

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,679
the The Cosmic Boogie poster before I'm

28
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,519
going to go through and kind of

29
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,359
highlight some of this stuff because

30
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,599
it's one of the rarest items in cannabis

31
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,560
I mean uh if I remember correctly the

32
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:16,879
last one sold for upwards of five grand

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,560
probably a little more um yeah so if

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:23,359
you're hunting for these things be

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,640
prepared to wait a long time and uh to

36
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:29,640
spend spend a lot you know to spend a

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,680
lot so with that we'll start at the top

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,960
we we have the silver haze

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,799
bud with trademark underneath it it's

40
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,000
really hard to see it's really

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,439
light then we have connoisseur's Choice

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,040
cultivated California

43
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,798
Cannabis down here it says

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,240
Americana 19 I can't really tell what

45
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,280
some of these things say cuz my vision's

46
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,438
so bad

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,239
now but yeah that's some of the inner

48
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:00,359
writing that's really tiny people have

49
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,478
asked to see on the podcast cast when I

50
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,959
get a chance and then we

51
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,959
have warning in some states cannabis is

52
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,639
illegal

53
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,080
enjoy another cool thing are the signs

54
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,839
of the

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,000
zodiac because as Farmers we

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,959
rely on the

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,959
seasons and you know back then the

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,560
Farmers Almanac was really big and uh

59
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,878
this kind of represents that the growing

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,120
Seasons as you can see there's weed

61
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,919
leaves under

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,640
each little horse scope

63
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,119
sign it's all beautifully done I I would

64
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,919
love to know who did the art for this

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,039
there's not a lot of info out there

66
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:45,839
about it um what else do we have we

67
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:48,039
have organically grown acclimatized

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,800
what's that mean it's grown

69
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:53,439
organic and it's acclimatized to North

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,519
America's outdoor I mean realistically

71
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,199
Santa Cru outdoor but they're kind of

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
putting it out there that it's grown and

73
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,199
acclimatized that they have Haze a

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,959
sativa over here that is growing right

75
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:09,878
it's finishing proper all that um see

76
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,519
where is it no chemicals yeah organic No

77
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:15,598
Seeds they obviously don't want you

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,400
getting their seeds um let's see is and

79
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,719
then there's somewhere it says in nature

80
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,158
we trust but I can't remember where

81
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:27,519
that's exactly

82
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:31,878
at anyway um then we have my favorite

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:35,480
part the scale the Triple Beam scale

84
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:38,239
what that signifies is Honest Weight and

85
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:41,158
the triple beam balance represents

86
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,680
ethical business practices integrity and

87
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,039
Trust according to granddaddy Mike so

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,840
that's what that means and if you see it

89
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:52,598
says weight there on that side and can't

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,158
honest on that side so honest weight God

91
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,959
some of this is

92
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,199
so

93
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,239
light and um the enjoy

94
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,598
and it says enjoy celebrates the spirit

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
of the Cannabis

96
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,438
cultivation at work in the haze and

97
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,958
there's a quick side note that

98
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:13,560
granddaddy Mike put on the on the thing

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,160
on the poster page and it says it is

100
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,439
interesting to sometime God it's so hard

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,720
to read this it is interesting

102
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:25,199
to remember that in 1975 to 1976

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,520
topshelf cannabis was $50 to $60 an

104
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,080
ounce and that silver Hayes was

105
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:35,198
introduced at $250 an oun

106
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:39,279
the entire Harvest sold in 90

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,960
days wow can you imagine selling outdoor

108
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,439
everything gone in 90 days you know for

109
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,719
that price it's crazy and real quick

110
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,680
I'll read right here what uh the poster

111
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,400
says in clandestine location sparsely

112
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,840
scattered throughout California a few

113
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,839
dedicated Farmers cultivate the herb

114
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,879
cannabis as a way of life anyone can

115
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,799
grow weeds and see the Virgin green but

116
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,199
to cultivate the Exotic Queens beyond

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,000
your dreams you should have dedication

118
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,000
sensitivity to plant life consistency a

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,519
little basic knowledge Good Karma and a

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,199
great desire to find harmony with Mama

121
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,719
nature the basis for any strong healthy

122
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,800
plant is the soil it grows in resin

123
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,600
producing herbs grow best in soil that

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,520
is neutral to semisweet the larger the

125
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,039
bush or tree whatever it may be the

126
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,519
larger the root structure needed to

127
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,240
support it Roots develop most freely in

128
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,120
a loose rich soil

129
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,879
mix one yard of soil composed of 30%

thoroughly and let it sit for at least

138
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,360
one week then check the the soil with a

139
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,079
soil testing kit for pH and add

140
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,800
agricultural lime to bring pH to 7.5 to

141
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:11,560

147
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,918
above ground herbs in May the third

148
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,359

00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,719
one of those signs when POS when

153
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,000
possible cancer is the most excellent

154
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,199
time to irrigate Taurus Scorpio and

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,199
Pisces are also good for irrigation

156
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,598
pruning should be done only in the third

157
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,240
quarter patience is the real secret and

158
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:51,038
true Tre test try to make it until

159
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,598

161
00:06:53,598 --> 00:07:01,399
perfect so if you can dig

162
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,400
it in nature We Trust Spirit of 7

163
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,639
