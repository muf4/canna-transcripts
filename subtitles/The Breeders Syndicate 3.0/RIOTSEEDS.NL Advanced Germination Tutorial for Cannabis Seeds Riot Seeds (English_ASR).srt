1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,000
this is the riot seeds Advanced

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,719
germination tutorial um I used to have a

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,599
pictorial up a long time ago the

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,359
pictures disappeared off the site so I

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,560
decided to do a video and keep it

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,679
updated um first part here I'm showing

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,320
you all the components you'll need from

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:24,320
beginning to finish over there

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,079
antibacterial soap hydrogen

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,079
peroxide this isn't necessary but I like

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,598
to use green soap to keep my hands super

12
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,878
clean andure that everything in the

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,359
environment is is pretty spotless um

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:38,119
something you're not seeing I clean the

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,039
counters with green soap um just so

16
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,000
there's no potential contamination

17
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,600
that's what we're trying to avoid here

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,159
um over there that is 200 mL of

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,239
distilled water okay there's a pair of

20
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,919
scissors you may or may not need

21
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,159
depending on what you're going for um if

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,760
it's a hard seed to crack uh and it

23
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,679
won't crack on its own it won't let

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,599
water in on its own we're going to use

25
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:06,000
the scissors but if not let it be uh you

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,000
have a Ziploc baggie a dropper a Sharpie

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,560
a paper towel and some tape tape will be

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,959
at the end anyway so let's start uh

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,640
let's see let me get a new piece of

30
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,839
paper towel there cuz I like to have a

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,359
piece of paper towel on the counter just

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,799
in case anything goes wrong um in case

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,359
any little bit of contamination is still

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,360
there it's just that one extra

35
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:33,599
barrier so what I do is I fold the paper

36
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:36,640
towel into I think eth is what it is one

37
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,559
two that's in a quarter quarter size

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,759
right now and then one more time the

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,680
eight now this is the most important

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,200
part this is a part nobody ever [ __ ]

41
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,040
talks about um the biggest reason seeds

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,879
don't quote unquote germinate and and

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,719
they actually do germinate but what's

44
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,759
happening is a bacterial process is

45
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:59,199
stopping it from completing

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,439
germination um oh [ __ ] first before all

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,039
that before all that

48
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:03,599
wash your [ __ ] hands I already did

49
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,320
this so I'm not going to show that on

50
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,640
it'd be too hard to show it anyways but

51
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,560
wash your [ __ ] hands wash it with

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,439
antibacterial soap right away make sure

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
everything's clean like I said I use

54
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,159
green soap right after that to make sure

55
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,919
that my hands are completely [ __ ]

56
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:21,120
spotless again you don't want bacteria

57
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,559
getting to the the tap r um but yeah

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,039
with the germination process a lot of

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,519
people think seeds don't germinate if

60
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,159
they come out a little bit and get mushy

61
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,360
no they're germinating bacteria is

62
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,919
getting to the Tap Room

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,680
that means you were almost there but

64
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,958
some kind of contamination happened

65
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,239
that's what we want to avoid so we use

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,000
uh 3% hydrogen peroxide this is hydrogen

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,800
peroxide you can get any this is

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,598
Walgreens I think um and we have a

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,640
dropper here now there's 2,000 ml give

70
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,759
or take 100 or 200 mL in this pitch this

71
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,639
pitch has been thoroughly clean with

72
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,878
green soap too it's a little old so it

73
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,518
looks beat up but trust me it's clean

74
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,719
all right so we

75
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:06,519
get our dropper let me see if I can um

76
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,560
let's see do this so you can see it get

77
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,680
our

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,199
dropper put a little bit of hydrogen

79
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,040
peroxide in it I don't know if that got

80
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:18,598
any yeah it did okay so you

81
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:23,039
see hydrogen peroxide right there we put

82
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:27,120
three drops in this whole thing one 2 3

83
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:30,199
good um just dump out the remaining

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,158
[ __ ] take this little wand just so you

85
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,479
don't have to have an extra tool

86
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:35,840
available and stir that [ __ ] make sure

87
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:39,959
the hydrogen peroxide is in there very

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,400
well good also this goes in the water

89
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,560
everything needs to be washed what I do

90
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,519
is I just spray everything with green

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,360
soap at the beginning everything and

92
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,680
then wipe it down um okay now we can

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,720
take

94
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,840
the paper towel put it in there put it

95
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,878
in the water you want to ring it out cuz

96
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,640
this is this is too much that will that

97
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,120
will cause problems

98
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,958
but that is just enough not soing wet

99
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,840
still pretty moist so the water has

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,079
enough water to get in not excessively

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,079
dripping that's

102
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:22,319
perfect see here one second I have to

103
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,319
put you down while I grab the

104
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,240
seeds and in this case we're going to be

105
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,520
using Williams

106
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,600
Wonder these are the last few seeds I

107
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:40,120
have of it so uh there's only going to

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,919
be a few seeds in here

109
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,918
guys the Williams W

110
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,159
seeds and we Pat that down okay so you

111
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,519
take the seeds in my hand there are

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,280
three and you place

113
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,038
them evenly across the top so they have

114
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,559
room with you fold this paper towel over

115
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:09,560
on itself to have the tap r

116
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:14,079
grow right there like so you take

117
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,240
this fold it over the top to right

118
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:21,599
there Pat it down and you get your

119
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,600
Ziploc baggie label

120
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,120
it um normally I would just put ww but

121
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,639
my brain might force me to think that's

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,639
white widow and I would not be cracking

123
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
some White Widow

124
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm trying to write this while looking

125
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,439
through the phone so I'm writing like a

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,439
half [ __ ] there we

127
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,758
go you put that

128
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,839
[ __ ] you guys like this all onehanded

129
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,280
[ __ ] did any seats fall out see trying

130
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,239
to [ __ ] around and that's what happens

131
00:05:53,279 --> 00:06:00,279
all right put the seed back

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,759
in take this

133
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,719
and we put it in the baggie I'm going to

134
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,560
have to put it down to put it in the

135
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,800
baggie I'll bring you back and show you

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
what I

137
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:15,159
did now some people question this

138
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:18,719
part but there's a good explanation for

139
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,720
it next I will take

140
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,319
tape and like

141
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:32,000
so stick it to the top of that and then

142
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,860
I like to put it in a dark place where

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,949
it can be suspended one

144
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,949
[Music]

145
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,439
sec right

146
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:49,119
here the reason I do that that didn't

147
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,120
work out so

148
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,840
well the reason I do that is so gravity

149
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,198
can act on the seedlings and the tap

150
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,399
route will grow downwards instead if you

151
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,478
leave it flat on its back like if I

152
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,719
replace it right here downwards the tap

153
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,038
rot sometimes grows in a circle you know

154
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,120
trying to grow downwards it's always

155
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,038
going to try to grow down with gravity

156
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,319
so in this case you won't have curly q

157
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,519
ceilings that are really hard to plant

158
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,000
and I just shut the

159
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,959
cabinet vo [ __ ] law that's how it

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,720
works

161
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:27,439
