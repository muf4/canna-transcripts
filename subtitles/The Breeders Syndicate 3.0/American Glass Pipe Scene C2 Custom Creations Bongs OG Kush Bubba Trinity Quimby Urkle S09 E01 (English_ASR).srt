00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,579
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,100

makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,799
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,140
has become much bigger than myself

their glass but they both have a lot of

33
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,899
history in the scene a lot more than

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,540
just glass so we wanted to take the time

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,000

where we actually talk to people who

41
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,340
work with glass right it is it is and

42
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,140
something I've been wanting to do really

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,240
really bad because it's a it's an art

44

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
as well like being in New Zealand you

47
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,938
know I'm pretty sure what we get to see

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,978
is like cheap Chinese stuff

49
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,798
um or like you know Gatorade bottles

50
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:52,200

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,420
sweet I actually have really really

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,899
enjoyed learning um a little bit more

53
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,719
about where the glass Tech has gone and

54
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,579
a little bit about the history

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,340
um

56
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:07,978
and uh I'll say as well that you know C2

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,659
Custom Creations um Yola based in Eugene

58
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:13,098
technically right is that is that

59
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:16,680
correct no no we're we're in California

60
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:18,899
I did know that I did know that but

61
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,959
Michael did you spend time in Eugene

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,180
earlier on yourself yeah born and raised

63
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,800
in Eugene ah you so you're you're the

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,319
one okay gotcha

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,340
all right well I think we start at the

66
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,098
start

67
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,840
and I want to ask you both and I'm aware

68
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,119
that the two of you have had maybe quite

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,520
different Journeys initially so maybe

70
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,039
you all can take turns but the first

71
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,900
question is how did you get into either

72
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,859
cannabis or glass you know depending on

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,860
which one came first

74
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,079
Okay so

75
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,040
cannabis

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,739
um

77
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,699
pretty normal I come from a you know

78
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,319
small town Eugene Oregon it's uh herb is

79
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:05,280
super prevalent there

80
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,318
uh grew up my family itself was real

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,300
conservative I never saw my parents

82
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,780
drink alcohol

83
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,040
um it was just never around but

84
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,318
about

85
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:19,318
1988

86
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,318
I'm sure the dead had visited before but

87
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,458
they started a tour that came to Austin

88
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,658
Stadium

89
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:31,560
and that was the first time that

90
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:34,378
I had seen like that many hippies and

91
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,239
just like Counter Culture people

92
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:39,899
in the city ever

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,560
and uh I remember my parents had told me

94
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,459
do not go near the stadium for this

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,259
weekend

96
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,539
and so the first thing I did was I

97
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,239
jumped on my bike

98
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:53,759
my pass went straight to the stadium

99
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,878
got up got off my bike walked around

100
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,759
through Shakedown Street I looked up and

101
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,239
down the booths I saw the crazy plastic

102
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:05,280
bongs I had no idea what they were for

103
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,799
you know I knew it's definitely smelled

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,620
different than anything I had ever seen

105
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,540
before you know and uh I think that's

106
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,099
really how old were you

107
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,139
and I was

108
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,279
in probably in between 11 and 12 years

109
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,160
old

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,379
and that's when I definitely at least

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,320
started my interest

112
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,079
of what was going on something that I

113
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,599
had never seen before

114
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:32,698
fast forward a few years and I was in

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,840
high school a few of my friends have

116
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,220
been smoking weed and I hadn't

117
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,258
um

118
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,759
and I made a deal with one of them to

119
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,040
where they could give me just a little

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,720
bit and I'd bring it home and me and my

121
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,879
one of my little brothers would try it

122
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,580
and we tried to figure out how to get

123
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:54,779
the the Coke can to work and

124
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:57,180
uh yeah did our best to smoke it I have

125
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,039
no idea if it worked or not but

126
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,079
that's pretty much uh my first

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
experience with cannabis

128
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,060
did you just throw the Chunk on the just

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,399
a chunk of it on the can

130
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,800
I tried that's what I did it had been

131
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,939
snowing the night before there was a

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
little bit of snow on the ground I

133
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,660
remember we maybe got one or two hits

134
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,459
before that thing fell in the snow and

135
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,240
we were on our knees trying to find it

136
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,239
and couldn't think

137
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,160
you know

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,038
um

139
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,860
as far as getting into glass uh after

140
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,139
that first time of smoking I definitely

141
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,538
I was interested in it I continued to

142
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,400
smoke I was in Eugene so we were real

143
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:36,360
fortunate

144
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,519
um

145
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,979
we would go down to 13th Street which

146
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,079
was close to the university and there'd

147
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:45,418
always be hippies down there and you'd

148
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,659
walk by them and they'd whisper you know

149
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:51,060
nugs or this or that and if you had 40

150
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,979
bucks you can get a really nice sack of

151
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,060
weed even as a little kid a high school

152
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,879
kid

153
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,639
you know so I was real fortunate in that

154
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,339
it was easy to get

155
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,460
um so after high school I went to the

156
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:07,319
University of Oregon and I had ran into

157
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,180
a friend

158
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,339
from high school that had started

159
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,939
working at a glass shop

160
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:18,119
and uh he invited me over to the glass

161
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:20,100
shop to kind of see what was going on

162
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,038
and at that point I had made some pretty

163
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,220
good connections with with weed and I

164
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,620
was getting good weed regularly and I

165
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,000
guess the owner of that glass shop was

166
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,780
from California

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,839
and what he had done is moved to Eugene

168
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,818
and started a small shop

169
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,859
um I went in there I showed him some of

170
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,960
the weed I had he was real interested in

171
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,879
it and I made an agreement with him

172
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,159
where hey

173
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,860
I'd be willing to hook you up with this

174
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,139
weed when I get it regularly but I want

175
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,419
to learn how to make those pipes

176
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,100
because the pipes you know they were not

177
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:57,839
the coolest thing other than the wheat

178
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,800
itself that I had ever seen

179
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:05,038
yeah and uh so I made a deal with him

180
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,918
and I got into the shop that way and

181
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,500
they basically just started me out as an

182
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,318
apprentice on an apprentice program

183
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,680
and I took it from there

184
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,660
and I just within a year I had dropped

185
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,259
out of the University of Oregon

186
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,039
yeah we're not a real trade yeah went on

187
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,960
my Merry way with uh weed and cannabis

188
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,879
but that's like how you broker your way

189
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,339
into a trade though right like you have

190
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,079
to find ways to to get yourself into

191
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,359
different trades as a Young Man during

192
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,240
that era not everything was just laid

193
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,580
out for you as a not super rich kid you

194
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,918
know yeah absolutely not you had you had

195
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,079
to have something to offer to even get

196
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,279
in the door there and that was one of

197
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,959
the coolest things about that shop

198
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,059
because looking back

199
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,060
most of the kids in that shop were under

200
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,000
25 years old I think I was either 19 or

201
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,740
20. and every one of them brought

202
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,598
something different to the table as far

203
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,579
as weed goes and I could tell they all

204
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,680
got their jobs the same exact way I did

205
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,680
yeah it makes sense dude

206
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,978
um the reason why I mentioned Eugene

207
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,560
obviously in the introduction for those

208
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:16,199
of you who may not know is that it's

209
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,319
recognized as one of the places for

210
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,439
glass am I correct in saying that

211
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,220
or is yeah heralded like an era and all

212
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:28,680
right yeah that's where uh Bob snoggrass

213
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,219
kind of laid his flag and he's really

214
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,580
like the first fumed

215
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,020
glass pipe maker that was well known you

216
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,360
know I think he had been slinging pipes

217
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,278
on the Dead tours of the 70s maybe

218
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,440
earlier I'm not even sure but he's a

219
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,259
great guy and he was the one that

220
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,779
basically started the Glass Pipes and if

221
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:51,059
you wanted to learn how to make a glass

222
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,679
pipe in Oregon you needed to know

223
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,419
someone that had either learned from him

224
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,000
or one of his apprentices

225
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,919
and I think that's kind of we all

226
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,759
you know grow from the roots of that

227
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,919
tree

228
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,778
it's interesting that's great that's

229
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,219
that's some really cool uh

230
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:07,439
historical

231
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,620
um yeah signposting there

232
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,660
okay what about you Hamlet oh me it was

233
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,299
a little different I mean I remember I

234
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,519
was a 14 and I had a really stressful

235
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,879
day and my my circle of friends were

236
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,740
always older than me growing up so uh

237
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,539
one of my friends saw what I was going

238
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,820
through and it just passed me a joint

239
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,740
and I've never smoked before I mean I've

240
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,600
seen people smoke and stuff and I wasn't

241
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,700
about it but that day I was like you

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,339
know what I'm gonna give this a try and

243
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,259
when I did it it changed my life really

244
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,940
like I was like oh I could feel like

245
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,319
this instead of being you know all

246
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,640
[ __ ] up and stressed out of my mind

247
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,339
this is perfect

248
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,720
so you know in that token

249
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,700
um I don't know what kind of weed it was

250
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,259
or what strain or anything when I smoked

251
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,899
it um felt great

252
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,519
and I started looking more into it and I

253
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,100
realized that there's a whole scene with

254
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,839
like graphics and glass pieces being

255
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,100
made because of it and this and that and

256
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,839
I was like wait a minute my dad's been

257
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,959
to Glass floor for more always life even

258
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,880
before I was born oh wow yeah he was an

259
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,099
internationally known glass floor

260
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:09,778
um he worked in all kinds of different

261
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,700
projects nothing to do it nothing to do

262
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:13,799
with weed um yeah yeah scientifical

263
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,660
stuff a lot of Aerospace stuff satellite

264
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,919
dish

265
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:18,659
yeah and I just kind of grew up around

266
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,539
that and I never really

267
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:23,278
looked at it that way until that that

268
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,019
kind of week when I started looking more

269
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,399
into smoking and this I was like wait a

270
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,259
minute this is something here you know

271
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,759
so growing up I showed more and more

272
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,838
interested in the glass

273
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,580
um and when I was about 17 years old he

274
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,740
used to work at a company called scitec

275
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,639
class out of more Park

276
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,080
um

277
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,179
I think at the time they were actually

278
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,820
in a different city but yeah either way

279
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:47,458
and and he I got a summer job there one

280
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,800
time you know during break pool and I

281
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,778
learned a few things and um and it was a

282
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,000
short time job you know I a short period

283
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:55,259
I got out and started talking my dad I

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,059
was like well listen you know we could

285
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:58,500
we can do this we could make pipes and

286
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:02,039
like I'm learning and you can teach me

287
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,839
more and he was a little hesitant but he

288
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,338
wanted to you know he was tired of

289
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,740
working for somebody else for you know

290
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,300
most of his life yeah he made a good

291
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,980
living but then again working for

292
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:12,479
somebody else is not the same

293
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,480
so

294
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,240
um we opened 1994 I remember like

295
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,000
yesterday January 5th I was 17 years old

296
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,000

at night I was learning how to do prep

301
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:35,879
on glass during the day and he would

302
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,919
teach me things along the way and uh

303
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,958

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,800
was really happy about it and he was

334
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,179
excited that I was doing pretty good

335
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,338
with it and I was like he would show me

336
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:46,078
something and then the next day in the

337
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,120
daytime I would make it wrap it for him

338
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,739
he would come from after the job this

339
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,480
new business we have and he would see

340
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,159
all the parts that I made all the prep

341
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,539
work I he you know he was excited about

342
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,860
he was like oh my God this is great like

343
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,539
I can use this I don't have to mess with

344
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,459
it I don't have to change it you know

345
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:02,099
it's great so I'm picking up pretty

346
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,179
quick and you know a couple times he got

347
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,980
a little upset because I was doing other

348
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,539
[ __ ] trying to make my own pipe and this

349
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,399
is like no you're not ready you know you

350
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:09,539
got to do the steps yeah of course you

351
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,519
know like everybody else I'm trying to

352
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,379
jump ahead and do what I can do and make

353
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,240
a pipe for myself I can take away before

354
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,399
he even gets there you know yeah right

355
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,320
he he didn't like me smoking weed like

356
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,659
he was like oh you know you shouldn't

357
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,459
you're young this that uh you shouldn't

358
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,899
do it and your mom doesn't like it and I

359
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,099
in later on in life I realized it was

360
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,958
just mainly because my mom didn't like

361
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,639
it he would smoke weed on his own but we

362
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,159
kept it from each other yeah of course

363
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,899
of course right yeah like you know he

364
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,259
would smoke blunts and come home and

365
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,259
tell me

366
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,200
we don't want her pissed at me or him

367
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:48,240
right yeah so that yeah that's how that

368
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,220
went with that but um yeah and then we

369
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,959
just did more and more with the class

370
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,160
there was times along the years where I

371
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,778
did my own thing on the side but I

372
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,699
always but left my foot in there like

373
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:58,139
help them with the business and did

374
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,180
other things and try to progress and

375
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,740
give new ideas and like pressure because

376
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,679
he was older you know with all the crowd

377
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,200
to him it was basically like spliffs

378
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,759
really just tobacco and weed mixed

379
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,339
together and and you know with the

380
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,899
papers but um yeah I showed him like the

381
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,519
glass scene at what's available a lot of

382
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,379
the scientific stuff is coming out like

383
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,839
things are getting involved and it's

384
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:21,059
getting more intricate and nicer and we

385
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,380
kind of built on that together

386
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,138
um you know there was a lot of hard

387
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:27,299
times along the way but it it grew

388
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,680
faster than we thought and within like a

389
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,719
little bit short of a year he quit the

390
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,638
other job we're full time into this and

391
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
now we're working side by side so I was

392
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,240
learning more because when I made a

393
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,739
mistake he was right there on top of me

394
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,000
he was right there next to me telling me

395
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,339
Oh do this like this or you could do

396
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,720
this like that and from that putting it

397
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,420
together from what I'm learning and

398
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,920
putting my input into it and uh we kind

399
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,360
of just went with the scientific line

400
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,179
with it you know like just progressed

401
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,740
with that the class and um it's a funny

402
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,078
story from where the old shop was

403
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,839
actually there was a there's kind of

404
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:00,359
like a side story but there was a whole

405
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,220
race scene like import car racing that

406
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,079
was going on and we would work late

407
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,940
nights because it was just cooler and

408
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,620
temperatures were better and we would

409
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,480
always hear these cars racing right

410
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,940
outside of the shop on the street and I

411
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,860
guess one day cops pulled up and all

412
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,519
these race cars just flooded our parking

413
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,278
lot

414
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,019

416
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,278
rifle like a big ass milk and rifle

417
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600

00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,338
reversed and he was almost getting shot

425
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:42,439
because he was trying to reverse close

426
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,180

like no I like weed I like pipes like I

437
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,039
want to see what you guys have like I

438
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:07,620
know you guys are blowing Us in there I

439
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,299
saw the Torches driving by and this and

440
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,519
he was pretty ballsy for doing that but

441
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,500
it worked out and then we became really

442
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,899
close friends you know like really close

443
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,799
friends with the family uh with him with

444
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:21,839
us and he actually introduced me to Kush

445
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,240
and which I've never smoked before OG

446
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,180
kush yeah yeah when I smoked that I was

447
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,680
like what the [ __ ] is it like oh holy

448
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,078
[ __ ] there's this is a life-changing

449
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:33,359
weed the first time yeah I remember that

450
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,278
I got the OG Kush from him first time

451
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,039
Bubble Kush from him

452
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,519
um banana kush probably blackberry kush

453
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:44,039
too I don't recall that it wasn't

454
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,839
memorable yeah it's definitely not

455
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,578
memorable now that's what's stuck in my

456
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,440
head because when I smoked that and

457
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:51,958
inhaled it and exhaled and I felt that

458
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,300
flavor and the eye I was like what I've

459
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,458
been smoking [ __ ] mids all this time

460
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,198
you know yeah yeah the best [ __ ] weed

461
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,518
I've ever tasted so I had to become very

462
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,799
close friends with them and it was cool

463
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,839
you know we were cool like we went to a

464
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,279
couple of uh festivals together like you

465
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
know had some parties at his house at my

466
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,599
house we hung out

467
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,279
um what year was this roughly well I'm

468
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,619
sorry

469
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,119
what year was this roughly

470
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:21,838
oh my God uh 90

471
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:24,178
5 96 okay something like that uh and it

472
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,099
it it went on from there so I remember

473
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,839
the OG Kush was the first one and then

474
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,418
later on there was more of the flavors I

475
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,639
got from him and he's he actually pushed

476
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,380
a lot of our line and uh and the

477
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,759
features on our pipes because he would

478
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,980
come up like oh you know you should do

479
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,359
this or you should do that or you should

480
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,579
make a pipe that is this way maybe

481
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,139
you'll get more flavor or you know he

482
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:45,599
had a lot of input with it he was very

483
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,160
much involved in the whole thing

484
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,779
um and we would like you know hook them

485
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,019
up with pieces he would come by seconds

486
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:53,460
from us all the time and it was a good

487
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,839
relationship with him you know like he

488
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,279
and he would give me the I mean he would

489
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,500
give me the best weed I would trade for

490
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,178
glasses perfect for me oh yeah dude paid

491
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,579
money for it you know

492
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,559
um yeah that was a good time with that

493
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,359
um but yeah

494
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:11,819
kind of lost my Chain of Thought with

495
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:15,779
that no you're good I and I think

496
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:18,599
I think he was calling it OG Kush

497
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:21,558
back then but in reality I'm pretty sure

498
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,558
it was his Bubba

499
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,419
yeah yeah but that particular one was

500
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,619
his Bubba yeah that was dangerous that

501
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,720
was like it was the best way that I

502
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,459
smoked and I loved Bubba it's got me

503
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,620
more into it more interested with it

504
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,140
trying to do more different perks

505
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:45,359
different ideas uh different ways we

506
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,919
could cut the glass and and this was all

507
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,019
with like fuming and clear this is

508
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,759
before all these colors and array of

509
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:52,379
palette that we have now that's

510
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,720
available now we didn't have that back

511
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,539
then we don't have others who had you

512
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,360
know silver gold and then a blue came

513
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:02,160
out randomly yeah that was it for a good

514
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,740
long time so we didn't have much

515
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,360
variations but you know like taking the

516
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,700
techniques without my dad had with the

517
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,399
with the lab industry and incorporating

518
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,500
it with the scientific line and the the

519
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,059
glass picked up and we did well with it

520
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,298
I think you know

521
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:21,980
um I mean next January next year January

522
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:24,779
will be 30 years that we started

523
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,980
it wasn't Custom Creations oh this is

524
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,660
what I want to say this is how custom

525
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,120
patients can be

526
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,700
um during this time I had a smoke shop

527
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,979
right next to UCLA at the same time I

528
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,340
was doing this and this was actually in

529
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:42,120
the early 2000s I want to say

530
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:44,759
um it was called C2 smoke shop and the

531
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,739
C2 was at a partner at the time and my

532
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,240
friend we were like trying to see if it

533
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,519
was going to be the cottonmouth corner

534
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,200
or chronic Corner smoke shop and that's

535
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,940
where the C2 came from it was actually c

536
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,500
squared thinking it was right next to

537
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,179
UCLA people who get it but everybody was

538
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,380
calling it C2 but it was a big c with

539
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,640
the little two on the corner yeah yeah

540
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,620
where

541
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,200
like in the college kids there's C2 C2

542
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:06,418
C2 you know

543
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,779
and that was about a four-year crazy ass

544
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,759
run at the uh only only smoke shops

545
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:16,879
between the only bar and the sorority

546
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:19,440
run so I was open from 3 P.M to 3 A.M

547
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,080
that was some wild times in that smoke

548
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,120
shop yes dude you can imagine all the

549
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,980
trumpets and everyone coming through but

550
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,859
that was about a four year run and then

551
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,599
when I closed that off I was like and

552
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:32,519
sorry to backtrack a little bit when

553
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,038
we're at high-tech glass we didn't

554
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,319
really sell direct to stores and it was

555
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,259
kind of like shady back then selling it

556
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:43,319
wasn't like it is now open yeah it would

557
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:45,419
have to be low-key with it real real

558
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,519
calm like relaxed with it can't be too

559
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,140
much advertising too much of this so we

560
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,759
were working with Distributors so we

561
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,740
would make other people's lines for them

562
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,240
this is what we're called high tech and

563
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,440
it's not the high-tech you might have

564
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,079
heard of where they make the bottles

565
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,798
like the bottle looking one

566
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,019
um

567
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,519
and we decided I was like well no we did

568
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:04,139
I stopped a smoke shop I had more hours

569
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,298
and more time I was like let's just have

570
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,400
our own line and just let sell Direct

571
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,319
you know um yeah that was like okay how

572
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,000
can we already had the C2 Corporation

573
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,500
name I was like how can we incorporate

574
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,179
this with this and change it so we

575
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,679
changed high tech to Custom Creations

576
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:21,179
because it fit the c squared

577
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:24,740
and that's where

578
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,740
so um yeah

579
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,340
jump in the pipe dreams oh yeah I mean

580
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,339
I'm just going down

581
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,179
there was a time we had to stop making

582
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:39,720
pipes and we started making anything

583
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:41,700
that we can out of glass why is that and

584
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,558
well because the Ashcroft and pipe

585
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,880
dreams came down and that's right one

586
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:46,859
down and scared the [ __ ] out of everyone

587
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,840
yeah and we will just completed these

588
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:52,439
all our Distributors all our accounts

589
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,879
they stopped carrying glasses yeah so I

590
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,220
just want to I just want to interrupt

591
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,980
and and make it real clear operation

592
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,640
pipe dreams was an FBI operation a

593
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,038
Crackdown correct U.S Marshals yes

594
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,419
Marshalls certain attorney generals from

595
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:11,400
certain States uh Pennsylvania Iowa

596
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,659
um I can't remember the third it might

597
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,880
have been Indiana I was doing the Bush

598
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:17,880
Administration right after the chills

599
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,799
got busted too yeah but it was basically

600
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,559
a few attorney generals from the United

601
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:24,960
States were able to bring charges for

602
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,940
people out of state for shipping

603
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,298
something illegal into their state

604
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,298
illegal mini glass pipes yeah mainly

605
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:35,099
that's why and I imagine this was also a

606
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:37,379
time when the glass scene was like

607
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:40,500
burgeoning right like

608
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,299
it was starting to get big yeah like we

609
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,919
were starting to have big trade shows

610
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:46,440
exactly it was getting too big for their

611
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,480
comfort you know yeah Jerome Baker was

612
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,940

were when you got into this stage like

658
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,080
obviously there was a point when you're

659
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,820
like okay pipe dreams kind of is cooling

660
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,339
down maybe we can get back into box but

661
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:59,158
exactly did you drop the dicks

662
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:02,158
after that or do you just be like

663
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,620
this is good money we had to let that go

664
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,080
because China got involved in India and

665
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,058
in ports and all the [ __ ] was just like

666
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,639
no money in it left you know no yeah

667
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:14,759
Chinese were in the dicks yeah it was it

668
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,940
was a short thing I mean they say it was

669
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,740
quite a few years too no we got back

670
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,720
into Gaspar and Jack were making those

671
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,220
for like oh so like three years so half

672
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,440
the shop was still doing it for a little

673
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,058
bit and then we trickled back into pipes

674
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,440
and like tested the grounds on that to

675
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,480
make sure it's still safe and it's okay

676
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,820
you know like that that's how that went

677
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,339
in three three three years I think it

678
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:38,158
was gone after that what was funny is

679
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:40,619
we'd be at a party with like all of his

680
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,559
dad's friends and he'd make it real

681
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:48,058
clear to us you can mention that we make

682
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:50,839
pipes I don't tell anyone we're making

683
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:50,839
those sex toys

684
00:25:56,298 --> 00:26:01,440
you know that look like dicks and tits

685
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,619
and all that like it was kind of funny

686
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,220
and turning into an old a whole part of

687
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,839
the thing but um but that's funny so

688
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,480
wait hold on I just wanted to double

689
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:15,119

how did you meet Okay so

694
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:30,960
I actually met uh his father way before

695
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,619
I met him

696
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,798
um

697
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:36,719
we had the same distributor that would

698
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,200
sell our glass pipes

699
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,500
and uh when I first met his dad

700
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,720
he was pretty early with his English it

701
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,000
wasn't great back then yeah and so wait

702
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,058

703
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,179
yes this is pretty dildo okay oh yeah

704
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:57,058
yeah yeah yeah this is pre-dildo

705
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:59,700
um and I would always see him and to be

706
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:01,798
honest coming from a small town I had no

707
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,840
idea what Armenian was I'd never heard

708
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,179
that term before and I'd never seen that

709
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,038
country on a map so like when I would

710
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,419
call my mom and talk to her and tell her

711
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,579
about people I'm meeting and different

712
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,679
things I'm seeing I'd be like man you

713
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:16,139
know there's a lot of these Russian guys

714
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,820
down here in Los Angeles

715
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,919
and uh

716
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,839
what it ended up came to be is that

717
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,080
there is a pretty healthy Armenian

718
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,519
population here and his father was a an

719
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,980
Armenian

720
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,200
and uh so we ran into each other at our

721
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,319
distributor one day and he's trying to

722
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,720
talk to me and I I don't understand he's

723
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,579
he's got a real thick accent you know

724
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,179
and I'm having a hard time understanding

725
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:45,839
what he's trying to say so he pulls

726
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,580
someone over one of his friends the next

727
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,139
time we were going to drop off product

728
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,418
because we did our drops on the same

729
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,059
days he had a friend come over that

730
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:57,299
spoke a little more English and what he

731
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:59,359
was trying to explain was hey

732
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:02,220
I'm a professional at this

733
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,859
you know a lot of people and have taught

734
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,960
a lot of people how to uh decorate the

735
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,399
glass but you're you're not a

736
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,200
professional glassblower you don't know

737
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,798
anything outside of the few things you

738
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,440
know how to do which was entirely true

739
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:19,440
um and he was explaining that let's team

740
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,200
up so that you can communicate for us

741
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,159
I'll make sure we're making the coolest

742
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,840
like best stuff that you can find and we

743
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,260
can be partners

744
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,158
and uh he actually he worked on me for a

745
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:35,099
good

746
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,200
six months to a year with that idea

747
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,298
before I finally was like you know what

748
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,460
let's just give it a try like I want to

749
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:45,778
know how the lathes work I all my

750
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,880
experiences in hand blown glass and uh

751
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:49,440
let's just let's give it a try and

752
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,840
that's how I met you at my at my

753
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,340
father's house yep I was I was stopping

754
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,259
by and I saw him

755
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,879
um with his wife at the time

756
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:58,619
and I was like oh who's this and they

757
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,539
introduced him this and that and and I

758
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,099
was at the time I was having a little uh

759
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,778
tiff with my with my dad like everyone

760
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,959
else you know like working it's not easy

761
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:08,940
working with your father yeah

762
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,519
I can imagine it was a tough guy to work

763
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,080
with and um so we're having back and

764
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,759
forth and this and that and I was really

765
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:16,439
short and I was kind of a dick to him

766
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:17,700
actually that's like I saw him I met him

767
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,460
I was like yeah I'm out bye you guys

768
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,019
have fun whatever you know but he he did

769
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,340
not be a great friend and a great guy

770
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,599
like that but that was the first time I

771
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:27,240
met him at my father's house through

772
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:29,158
through him and uh realized that they're

773
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,079
trying to start a venture together with

774
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,360
the business and uh incorporate things

775
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:34,918
and that's when I stepped back in I was

776
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,778
like okay we can do clear we can do

777
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,100
scientific we can do this we can do

778
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:40,200
different perks we can do different

779
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:42,599
sizes and shaping all this stuff and

780
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,960
kind of like but basically all three of

781
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:48,298
our minds together and uh progressed it

782
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,558
with the glass

783
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:51,778
nice

784
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:54,599
excellent okay so if we come back to

785
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:56,880
that um sorry I keep referring to it as

786
00:29:54,599 --> 00:30:00,298
this but we come back to the post dildo

787
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,760
period the three and post dildo eras I

788
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:05,099
guess that's right

789
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,898
so we're getting you know you guys are

790
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,240
getting back into the pipes at this

791
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:11,219
point and yeah what happens from that

792
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,859
point uh between that point and where we

793
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,558
are now

794
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:19,079
in what way as far as how our glass has

795
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,200
grown how the industry has changed like

796
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,639
what maybe a bit yeah I I don't know it

797
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,519
could be both

798
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,679
um maybe like what stands out to you

799
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:32,278
um from that period on because what year

800
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:35,880
would that have been now I would say

801
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:35,880
probably 2005

802
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:43,199
to 2006 is when you really saw a

803
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:47,399
transition in water pipes from just

804
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,500
being a beaker or a colored work Bubble

805
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,500
at the end of a straight tube

806
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
uh

807
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:59,220
having like the percolation and the

808
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,619
function of the pieces be the most

809
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,620
important thing and not so much just the

810
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,479
uh the colors of the artwork yeah yeah I

811
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:07,798
do want to okay I do want to say this

812
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,380
here because

813
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,179
uh in my mind before I you know looked

814
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,039
looked a bit deeper into it yeah and

815
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:17,038
exactly what you're saying in my mind in

816
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,859
2023 a bong is something with a chamber

817
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:23,099
it's got a bowl and a mouthpiece and

818
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:25,619
that's all I knew and so kind of

819
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:28,139
finding out about perks ratchets

820
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,719
recyclers like all these things kind of

821
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,179
blew my mind honestly

822
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,440
um so yeah sorry but please yeah please

823
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,259
continue

824
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,000
yeah I think at that point there was

825
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:41,158
enough people that had

826
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,099
um left the scientific industry or had

827
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:47,399
been trained in scientific glassblowing

828
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:51,000
that they could add to what

829
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:53,879
um I'd say the minimal knowledge of like

830
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,159
uh the art glass Community had as far as

831
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,299
uh function and seals and some of that

832
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,520
sort of thing

833
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:02,099
is that the division between scientific

834
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,778
and and because I remember when that

835
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:05,398
started popping up on websites where you

836
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:06,839
could buy glass you know like I remember

837
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,000
oh there's a segment that says

838
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,740
scientific and I never to this day

839
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,898
probably until this conversation I never

840
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,880
even could grasp what that meant why is

841
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:17,278
this one scientific versus this one

842
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,100
recycler throughout the glass history

843
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,898
like scientific glass Force kind of

844
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:25,199
stayed away from the pipe scene like

845
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:27,119
yeah they acted like they're too good or

846
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,100
whatever you know sure they want to mess

847
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,778
with the pipes but that whole science

848
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:32,879
Industry got turned upside down when

849
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:35,278
everything started being imported Yeah

850
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,260
by being outsourced and you know these

851
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,259
guys that have all these factories and

852
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,519
and equipment and you know materials and

853
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,658
they can't use it because they can't

854
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,579
sell it to anyone nobody they can't

855
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,320
compete so all of a sudden you know okay

856
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:48,000
like we'll get into the pipe industry

857
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,379
they were like okay you know it was kind

858
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,538
of like that what my father too trying

859
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,640
to talk him into it yeah like he was he

860
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:55,679
even when we first opened up a shop he

861
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,080
was trying to pick up the science Market

862
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,798
but that was like a dying Market in

863
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,079
America

864
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:04,379
because again everything was being yeah

865
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,939
being outsourced so with that they kind

866
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,159
of merged like all these science guys

867
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,140
and these high technical glass floors

868
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,940
got into the scene with all these other

869
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,620
artists that they're doing the art

870
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,080
aspect of it and the colors and the

871
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:18,239
working of it of making it pretty and

872
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,678
and it's definitely pleasing but you

873
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,058
know the science guys came in like okay

874
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,740
we can make it look pretty aesthetic

875
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:24,839
with using and we can add our thing to

876
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,399
it and make it more percolation double

877
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,319
chamber triple chamber yeah right

878
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,759
functionality having different perks

879
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,619
different ideas and then bring and then

880
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,778
that's kind of how the chords thing came

881
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:35,339
into it too like when I started talking

882
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,778
about chords and making quartz Nails

883
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,579
people didn't know what the [ __ ] that

884
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:39,898
was we even got knocked off a couple

885
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:42,058
times and it was made out of borrow

886
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:45,359
silica glass which explodes if you try

887
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:46,798
to porch it and and and oh my god well

888
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,500
yeah because it's not made for those

889
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,619
yeah yeah temperature differences in you

890
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,000
know and it also titanium changing to

891
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:55,319
quartz and I was you know like we're

892
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,240
pushing all the scientific guys we're

893
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:59,339
pushing towards because they worked with

894
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,558
courts before and they've done a lot of

895
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,939
course things I mean hell we used to

896
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:04,678
um the the company I used to work out

897
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,840
they used to make big like four foot

898
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,539
five foot table size they were called

899
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,579
quartz bolts and wafer holders and they

900
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:13,378
had the satellite like the reflective

901
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:15,598
Wafers they will cook inside of these

902
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:17,219
things in a quartz lineup where it

903
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,099
doesn't give off anything and it's clean

904
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:22,739
and it will heat to a point so that that

905
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,679
knowledge was brought in mainly due to

906
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,959
uh economics really because people had

907
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,059
to make money people had to keep working

908
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,679
you know they kind of force themselves

909
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:35,460
like they had forced themselves to jump

910
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,559
into this and and and mold into the

911
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,440
wheat industry and try to progress the

912
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:41,878
pipes and make sense I'm so glad that we

913
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,980
mentioned this because

914
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:47,699
um I watched a little documentary called

915
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,280
degenerate art on on the glass pipe

916
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:51,898
scene and one thing that I was wondering

917
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,879
about because most of the work that was

918
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:55,378
featured in that was very very

919
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,259
sculptural

920
00:34:55,378 --> 00:35:00,420
um uh kind of that I imagine that's what

921
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,160
you were referring to as art glass

922
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,500
um Michael

923
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,299
um and so I I was particularly

924
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,920
interested in this turning point so I'm

925
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,740
really glad that you guys have um

926
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,000
expanded on that yeah and I'm trying to

927
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:13,799
remember back to like the first

928
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,719
companies that were really pushing like

929
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,079
the new scientific stuff before we did

930
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:21,179
those was drawing well roar started

931
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,800
using the glass on glass stuff but I

932
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:25,379
remember Toro being like the first place

933
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,960
I saw the tree place no there was a

934
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,460
couple ones before was it yeah yeah

935
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,019
there was a couple of ones before we

936
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,320
even we used to oh I forgot about this

937
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:36,900
we used to make um the liquid Chamber Of

938
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,460
Glass before like uh illadelph or any

939
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,858
other companies are doing it back in the

940
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,960
day and you know we would mix food

941
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:45,598
coloring and not go certain time alcohol

942
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,539
yeah freezing when we're shipping it

943
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,460
over to states that are you know cold

944
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:52,800
um and I remember actually making one of

945
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,720
the first hand pipes and it made it onto

946
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,099
Michael Douglas's the game I don't know

947
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,659
if you guys ever seen that movie oh yeah

948
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,039
yeah for sure I've seen when they're

949
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:00,659
trying to where they're trying to frame

950
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,400
him and they show the bathroom that

951
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,500
there's like a teal looking pipe there

952
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,660
and some crack and some other [ __ ] or

953
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,980
whatever yeah and I made that pipe and I

954
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:09,719
saw it I was like oh my God this is

955
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,699
[ __ ] great that's awesome that's a

956
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:13,500
great movie that thing I I just you know

957
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:14,759
I it's there it's right there in the

958
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,739
movie I never got credit for anything

959
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,420
but you know it was one piece I made

960
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:21,000
that from nothing I made it the first

961
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,099
liquid-filled Empire which was a little

962
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,320
piece and then we used to Cork it and

963
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:29,460
and seal it with uh

964
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:31,380
um what was it epoxy and it lasted for a

965
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,820
good while you know until we got knocked

966
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,039
off and everybody else started making it

967
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,559
that was that that's a crazy story too

968
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,420
because I used to go to smoke shops to

969
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:40,799
get business and then that was one of

970
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,480
the worst things I did walking into a

971
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,980
smoke shop that I didn't know is

972
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,300
affiliated with a bunch of glass blowers

973
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,858
and they're like oh yeah we like these

974
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,240
pieces took one of everything and then

975
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:49,679
next you know hey they're trying to

976
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,739
they're trying to make their version of

977
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:56,399
it you know oh man oh yeah you know but

978
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:58,319
yeah that's scientific and uh and the

979
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,000
artistic kind of merged there but also

980
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,220
when you say art class there is also a

981
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,139
soft class form I don't know if you guys

982
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:07,618
are aware of this no no what's that yeah

983
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:10,679
that's like truly yeah like really

984
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:13,140
artistic colorful you know bigger pieces

985
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:15,239
like vases and

986
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:18,420
um like if you've been was it the win

987
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:20,759
the chandelier I think it's obaja oh the

988
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,780
Bellagio has a giant like Chandelier on

989
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,780
top I don't know if you guys ever been

990
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,400
to Vegas

991
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,079
there's a few well-known artists that

992
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,480
have been doing that for years stemming

993
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,760
from Italy like doing that old school

994
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,159
where they take the stick and they you

995
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,320
dip it in the glass pull it out and um

996
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,299
form it where our glass everything

997
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,760
starts with like a tube we get a

998
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,140
scientific tube and we form from that so

999
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,760
it it it's a different type of glass

1000
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:47,098
that one is soft glass this is borrow

1001
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,020
silicate so the art industry is kind of

1002
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:51,000
like

1003
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:53,880
merged between that and the Boro

1004
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,139
it just everything kind of stacked up

1005
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,838
and the timing was right for everything

1006
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,819
to go that direction you know to get all

1007
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,900
those pipes and pieces and the companies

1008
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,780
popping out

1009
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,099
I did one to also signpost here for um

1010
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,320
people like me who didn't really know

1011
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:10,440
about some of this tick uh previously

1012
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,780
and just to kind of like generalize a

1013
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,760
bit on the engineering side

1014
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,240
um I imagine most of these advancements

1015
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,079
had to do with how the flow of smoke and

1016
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,519
Air

1017
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,740
was being mediated in in the glass

1018
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:27,239
research and development

1019
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:29,779
yeah yes every single one of them

1020
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:33,118
[ __ ] you know

1021
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,859
that's the thing like I think each one

1022
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,599
of the companies that have been able to

1023
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:39,239
survive that make

1024
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,640
um this kind what I I call is like a

1025
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,799
scientific art glass

1026
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:46,500
um have their own own way of doing

1027
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:51,420
things I think for C2

1028
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:54,719
we have been really on top of fast flow

1029
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,300
easy function with coming up with

1030
00:38:54,719 --> 00:39:00,118
percolators that don't cost hundreds

1031
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,099
upon hundreds of dollars to produce and

1032
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,838
that that's kind of where we yeah I

1033
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,180
always had like the end user in mind too

1034
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:08,039
like we don't want to overcharge because

1035
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:10,319
you know we made something new and

1036
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,000
nobody has this like we could have went

1037
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,220
a different route and charged so much

1038
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,960
more and sold one or two pieces where me

1039
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,459
I was like I want everyone to experience

1040
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,900
this piece and everyone to feel what

1041
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,480
it's like to smoke out of a piece that

1042
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,000
percolates better that filters and easy

1043
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,740
to clean easy to you know it's just it's

1044
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,880
more functional it's better and I was

1045
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,979
like let's just try to get it to

1046
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,200
everyone instead of having a very small

1047
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,338
niche market where only a few people can

1048
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,338
afford it

1049
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:37,078
and one thing I ideal that's kind of how

1050
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:38,880
our pipes work it's getting the smoke

1051
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:42,480
from point A to point B as quick as

1052
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,160
possible yeah getting the pipes to you

1053
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,719
know person to person as quick as

1054
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,519
possible there's been many there's been

1055
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,139
many many designs where we discontinued

1056
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,880
we're just like oh this isn't working

1057
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:53,219
out you know we try to change it up a

1058
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,338
little bit this that happens exactly

1059
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:58,858
very hard to clean or too much drag or

1060
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:01,619
too flowy or Splash or any kind of

1061
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:04,319
things that are not you know positive

1062
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:05,880
and they don't work out the right way so

1063
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,320
we just kind of get rid of it or just

1064
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,420
change up the whole thing

1065
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,300
one thing I observed when I was looking

1066
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,440
at your catalog and gallery

1067
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,160
um that I thought was really interesting

1068
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,679
was that it seems like uh you know the

1069
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:21,420
overall uh structure of your pieces uh

1070
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,699
you know again like fairly scientific

1071
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,740
but it's kind of within the chamber that

1072
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:29,338
you guys kind of let some of that more

1073
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:32,219
like Creative Juice like flow a bit or

1074
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:35,759
like the art pops a bit more some of the

1075
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:37,019
like in pieces are you talking about the

1076
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,000
more like

1077
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:41,880
um the sculpt there's sculpted pieces

1078
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,858
they're sculpted inside that's right

1079
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,200
okay

1080
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:49,019
um yeah I mean that's just taking our

1081
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:51,239
normal perks and letting you know

1082
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:54,179
letting us kind of run with whatever we

1083
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:57,539
can possibly do in that small space that

1084
00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:00,118
can add is that yeah go ahead

1085
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:01,800
oh I'm just wondering like is that like

1086
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,559
an interesting set of constraints to

1087
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,359
work with when you uh

1088
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,858
you know that tiny space that you have

1089
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:09,539
to work with

1090
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:11,279
yeah especially when you introduce so

1091
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,900
many different colors because with glass

1092
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,859
a lot of different colors

1093
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,960
um

1094
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:17,639
work and cooperate differently with each

1095
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,960
other like some are not compatible with

1096
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,519
the others and you know the temperature

1097
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,800
differences you have to do minor

1098
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,659
adjustments you have we have a lot more

1099
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,280
braking and cracking issues when it

1100
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:27,960
comes to having sculpted pieces and

1101
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,320
having a finalized piece that's okay to

1102
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,820
go uh versus clear where it's it's all

1103
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,059
the same type of glass so it all works

1104
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:38,760
closely and it's easier to use so yes it

1105
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:40,858
does complicate a lot and um it changes

1106
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,240
the Dynamics of like how what

1107
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:44,578
temperatures we have to kill in it at

1108
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,199
how many times we can kill the color

1109
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:48,539
variations we can get from the different

1110
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,578
temperatures we use and that affects the

1111
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,500
outside shape too so it's like a good

1112
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,140
balance we have to come up with

1113
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:58,260
to to get those completed and done right

1114
00:41:55,139 --> 00:42:02,460
right and then but for the finished

1115
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:04,680
piece we have an idea of what the the

1116
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,838
end diameter and circumference is going

1117
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:09,960
to be inside the tube so we kind of know

1118
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:12,299
how much we have to work with and so

1119
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,579
it's just about whether or not we can

1120
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:18,140
fit what we want to within those

1121
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,140
parameters and

1122
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,200
okay let's go to the next side so here

1123
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,659
we go from a 65 millimeter to a 80

1124
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,460
millimeter or 110 millimeter now so okay

1125
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:30,358
we made it part for 110 it doesn't fit

1126
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,619
right we're going to figure out where

1127
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:33,358
we're going to put it in you know so

1128
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,920
we're below at the 110 and making it a

1129
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,139
little bit bubbly shaped so it has more

1130
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,059
circumference and room in it to put put

1131
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:41,819
the art piece that we want inside

1132
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,739
so it all kind of it's like it's like

1133
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,539
you kind of do it and then just judge it

1134
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:48,118
by then and trying to plan it as much as

1135
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,800
you can but things change you know I

1136
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,119
think what I like about it I mean of

1137
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,920
course the whole thing is a piece of art

1138
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,780
but the other way I can see it is that

1139
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,599
like the clear pod is like the frame

1140
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,579
almost or stage and then there's the

1141
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,220
more sculpted bit kind of like uh

1142
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,260
foregrounded uh or centered which is

1143
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:06,118
yeah I call those like our captured

1144
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,040
series because it's like capturing the

1145
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:10,260
art in a dome kind of like old school

1146
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,199
yeah like those you know creatures or a

1147
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:16,380
hand or whatever in the jar had an idea

1148
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,118
you know Frozen yeah that's cool it

1149
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,400
reminds me of like a snow globe as well

1150
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,240
in a way yeah

1151
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,740
absolutely yeah

1152
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:24,299
where the egg series was definitely was

1153
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:25,679
definitely like that

1154
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,480
for sure

1155
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,399
yeah it must be interesting to try to

1156
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,619
balance this kind of like aesthetic and

1157
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,559
function at the same time like always

1158
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:37,680
trying to find that balance

1159
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,019
well I will say one thing most of the

1160
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:43,618
custom pieces work great

1161
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:45,300
but if it's pure function for me

1162
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,680
personally I will always go with the

1163
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,200
clear pieces

1164
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:50,699
because I think they well the lines of

1165
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,679
it have been having having like straight

1166
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:54,299
smooth lines it makes the smoke travel

1167
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,639
easier and faster and you can control

1168
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,619
the chamber size better versus having an

1169
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,000
interesting head where it takes up a lot

1170
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,559
of the space and you're not exactly sure

1171
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,599
how much room you have in there for

1172
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,159
smoke where it's clear and it's straight

1173
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,599
you could have this size on the inside

1174
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:08,940
and the other side on the outside you

1175
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,880
know exact volume of smoke and air is

1176
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,380
coming through so you can really dial in

1177
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,480
it that way but most of our like

1178
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,760
artistic pieces first we dialed it in

1179
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,099
with a pole in the scientific part and

1180
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,260
then Incorporated the art part into it

1181
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,059
yeah so make sure it works and functions

1182
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,819
and then introduce the art and the other

1183
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:27,900
way around will be a lot harder yeah I

1184
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:30,000
think

1185
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,500
uh that's yeah this is great this is

1186
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,880
what I wanted to hear out of this

1187
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,920
conversation like these are all the

1188
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,200
things that like I just had no idea

1189
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,900
about so yeah I didn't either much for

1190
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:43,799
I've shot for glass for years and had no

1191
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,599
like I just looked at color shape that

1192
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,760
looks cool

1193
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,440
why isn't that more discolored this

1194
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,119
color I had no clue about any of this

1195
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,519
stuff it's fascinating from the art

1196
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,619
aspect yeah because I I think I was

1197
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,139
saying this to you spindle in private

1198
00:44:55,619 --> 00:45:00,300
um being outside of the US you know

1199
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:02,159
obviously like any other part of the

1200
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,859
world we get a lot of American culture

1201
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,719
but this is definitely not a part of

1202
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:09,420
American culture that most of the world

1203
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:11,159
has access to or has much insight into

1204
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,960
so I think this episode is actually

1205
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:14,940
going to be really cool for a lot of

1206
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,980
people who are overseas even people in

1207
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,358
America who may not know I think a lot

1208
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,659
of people are really missing out because

1209
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:24,420
there has been in the last 20 years some

1210
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:27,118
absolutely incredible artwork made by

1211
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,180
pipe makers oh yeah and I'm not saying

1212
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,059
like Gallery either of us absolutely not

1213
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:36,659
but there is some really impressive

1214
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:38,338
stuff that um I mean I've seen a lot of

1215
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:40,078
artwork as well and it doesn't get me as

1216
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:42,299
excited as some of the glass pieces I've

1217
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,859
seen reason why I think they didn't get

1218
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,720
traction is because it's it's part of

1219
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:47,519
the weed community and that's still

1220
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:48,899
frowned upon in a lot of [ __ ] places

1221
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,179
unfortunately and in the art community

1222
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,460
as well yeah yeah definitely the first

1223
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:55,139
person I met in the glass Community I

1224
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,900
was at some random

1225
00:45:55,139 --> 00:46:00,900
um festival in San Diego like weed

1226
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,660
festivals real random was Lacy lace face

1227
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,119
oh yeah her pieces there amazing and I

1228
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:07,618
was like I was mind blown like that this

1229
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:09,900
person right here had just made this

1230
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:12,720
beautiful glass like human beautiful

1231
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,940
female form sculpture it's all the parts

1232
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,338
and pieces yeah yeah he was insane yeah

1233
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,139
it was really cool to see in person she

1234
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:21,739
was a real cool chick too she's an

1235
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:23,940
amazing artist for sure yeah

1236
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:25,858
that's what I was saying if if she was

1237
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,780
let's say part of the art scene and had

1238
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:29,699
nothing to do with cannabis wheat or

1239
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:33,060
smoking I think she would have been more

1240
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:35,939
world uh yeah and more famous for what

1241
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:37,799
she does yeah I would guess so which is

1242
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,240
unfortunate but that's you know that's

1243
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,339
the reality of it that's how that's

1244
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:43,199
changing but then it is that is slowly

1245
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:44,818
going you know the right direction but

1246
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,219
it's very slow and it's been many many

1247
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:49,679
years yeah

1248
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:52,019
okay well if we take a little break from

1249
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,759
this like deep dive into the glass which

1250
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:56,400
[ __ ] I loved

1251
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,859
um what if we come back to the timeline

1252
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,318
um what's happened for you both in the

1253
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:05,460
last I think where were we last talking

1254
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:07,079
like uh mid-2000 like like 2005 2006.

1255
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,300
what's happened in the last you know 15

1256
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:13,019
years

1257
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:15,000
oh wow uh well

1258
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:17,818
um

1259
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,559
after uh there was a period in there

1260
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:20,818
where

1261
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:23,219
um

1262
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:26,219
his father and I were business partners

1263
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:28,980
and then we split

1264
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:32,459
and I moved out of state

1265
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:36,420
and about that same time Hamlet

1266
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:40,440
sold or closed his head shop and came

1267
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:41,099
back to work with full-time yeah Dad

1268
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,960
um

1269
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,838
and then uh

1270
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,079
a few years after that or no it wasn't

1271
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:52,559
too long but I moved back to California

1272
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:55,260
um to be with my family and

1273
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,519
we decided Well basically Hamlet invited

1274
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,720
me back to

1275
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:59,280
so that we could all start working

1276
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:03,059
together again

1277
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,160
and uh that was when we really started I

1278
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:07,679
think going crazy on new designs and

1279
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:10,500
yeah really pushing it hard the perks

1280
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,139
and doing the door seals and changing

1281
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,780
our line and this happened to kind of

1282
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:17,639
coexist with a time when

1283
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,859
um a lot of the glass blowers were

1284
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:22,500
starting to like double triple quadruple

1285
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:24,420
their prices on the water pipes to where

1286
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,818
they were getting like

1287
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:29,099
I don't want to say ridiculous

1288
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:31,259
but they were really expensive even for

1289
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:34,140
clear glass it was getting really really

1290
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,780
expensive and uh

1291
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:38,879
I think we

1292
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,800
I mean I remember us button heads a

1293
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,660
little bit about the the whether to go

1294
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,060
the color Direction the art direction or

1295
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:46,739
to focus on scientific uh you know

1296
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:48,960
obviously I was saying scientific he was

1297
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:50,699
saying color and we were going back and

1298
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,460
forth until we all of that kind of like

1299
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:55,919
merged in and with both of us did what

1300
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,539
we could but uh since then we just kind

1301
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,940
of really been you know hustling glass

1302
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:02,699
and pushing it and trying to do shows

1303
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,880
and events and venues and anything we

1304
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:04,879
can

1305
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:12,299
coexist in the height of the the import

1306
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:14,338
craze where if we designed something or

1307
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,800
someone famous designed something it's

1308
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:19,619
going to be knocked off overseas within

1309
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,119
six months if you're lucky yeah oh

1310
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,980
there's a time where they locked up they

1311
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,660
knocked out for an entire logo and they

1312
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,880
were putting it on shitty ass pipes yeah

1313
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:28,679
so all of a sudden downtown has all

1314
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,940
these C2 pipes that we never [ __ ]

1315
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:31,078
seen before and they don't even function

1316
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,300
they couldn't they didn't even

1317
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:34,740
understand the process of smoking like

1318
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,420
the perks didn't work you couldn't even

1319
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:38,338
draw air through it it would just suck

1320
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,019
water straight up it was like it would

1321
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:42,000
work as a straw a lot of it you know

1322
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:45,900
like the unusable pieces and has our

1323
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,300
[ __ ] house and you you know can you

1324
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,220
give us an insight into like what was

1325
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,920
their process like to make this really

1326
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:54,539
cheaply you know in comparison like how

1327
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,400
were they doing this

1328
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:59,579
well I think they used a lot of child

1329
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:04,440
labor child labor no safety at all of

1330
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:06,780
any kind uh cheap glass you know and uh

1331
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,059
not actually worrying about the function

1332
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,519
just because they were I'm assuming they

1333
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:12,779
would look at a picture or video and

1334
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:14,099
like okay I need to make this but they

1335
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:17,000
don't they don't even know what the [ __ ]

1336
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:19,079
it was for a lot of times

1337
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,818
and the other person that's finishing

1338
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:23,880
off the piece they don't know what's

1339
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:25,679
what or what is it used for or how even

1340
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,480
it's used and that's why a lot of those

1341
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,440
pieces want to function yeah they didn't

1342
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,119
have a lot of big smokers in China yeah

1343
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,539
it makes sense their fingers cut off or

1344
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:39,358
something like that exactly yeah right

1345
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:41,759
you know and so at this point oh sorry

1346
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,199
ego please I was just going to say I

1347
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,540
think that's kind of one of the ways

1348
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,980
that we really were able to say well

1349
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:48,838
open for business when a lot of people

1350
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,519
close we kept progressing was the fact

1351
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:52,858
that we kept progressing creating new

1352
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,139
designs and we've also done a good job

1353
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:56,818
of creating stuff at the cheapest

1354
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:59,039
possible price point that it could be

1355
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:00,659
made in this country Yeah well yeah

1356
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,639
because we're all hands on we we make

1357
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:04,019
everything ourselves we [ __ ] sweat

1358
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,118
and tears into it you know it's not like

1359
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,679
oh yeah just tell this guy to do it

1360
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,660
he'll take care of it all that no it's

1361
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,460
like oh we're involved in the whole

1362
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:13,259
thing yeah you know from the start to

1363
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,358
finish to when the Box leaves the

1364
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,920
[ __ ] uh Warehouse after it's packed

1365
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,558
we'll throw out the whole process we're

1366
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,838
involved there's no owner at the top

1367
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:24,540
collecting a paycheck and not coming to

1368
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:26,940
work like that's not a thing we have so

1369
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:29,219
we were able to definitely avoid that as

1370
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,440
well and that cuts a lot of the costs

1371
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:33,719
and puts the you know labor fact down in

1372
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,700
the labor costs down because we're doing

1373
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:38,659
it ourselves so right and we don't live

1374
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:41,039
like kings yeah

1375
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:43,199
it's like what it takes to have a small

1376
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,119
business in America today is stuff like

1377
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,679
that like you can't just

1378
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,420
you can't have a bunch of employees

1379
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:51,838
anymore you can't you have to do

1380
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,159
everything yourself and cut every cut

1381
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:58,159
everything down and be doing it yourself

1382
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:58,159
essentially because it's so hard

1383
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,220
in in this industry anymore I don't know

1384
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:04,858
of anything and well the cool thing

1385
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,659
about about it is us being like involved

1386
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:08,940
in the art and involved in the industry

1387
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:11,098
when we do have employees work and we

1388
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,720
they can't I mean not that they try to

1389
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,579
but they can't really get one over on us

1390
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,259
like other companies have or they're

1391
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:17,760
just a boss running things they has no

1392
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:21,119
idea how the glass works or how it's

1393
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,040
made you know or if if my guy is working

1394
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,358
and he's only making one of these pieces

1395
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,579
where I'd be like dude I can sit there

1396
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:28,500
and make three or four and you're only

1397
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:30,660
making one you're [ __ ] me like you're

1398
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,699
wasting my time you know and that helped

1399
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:35,399
too with all the having the prices down

1400
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:37,799
and having it affordable for everyone

1401
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,480
and and smoke shops across the country

1402
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,099
love this you know they love the fact

1403
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,900
that they can get American-made stuff

1404
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:46,019
that's made well that functions great

1405
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,579
and and the price points is realistic to

1406
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:50,338
most of their customers

1407
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:52,200
and that helped out a lot and and

1408
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:54,119
staying in business and and keep doing

1409
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:56,818
what we do

1410
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,960
and yeah realistically like I know we've

1411
00:52:56,818 --> 00:52:59,639
been to a lot of trade shows where

1412
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,460
people think we're like a big Factory

1413
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,960
company it is literally Hamlet eye and

1414
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,420
yeah let me try really hard to make it

1415
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,039
look that way

1416
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:10,200
but you know you know we've had people

1417
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:12,000
call us a big shop one of the big

1418
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,639
production shops before and I'm always

1419
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,719
like uh yeah it's literally three of us

1420
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:21,420
like we're you know we're good at what

1421
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:24,058
we do you know and so maybe it seems

1422
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,079
that way but we work our asses off you

1423
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:28,619
know

1424
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:30,300
yeah every single one is a lie yeah yeah

1425
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:33,599
every single one of the pieces was

1426
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,519
designed or made by us you know like

1427
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,140
we had to put we had to narrow it down

1428
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,239
perfect it before it goes on to

1429
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:41,759
production and production meaning we're

1430
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,618
still part of it you know yeah so yeah

1431
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,599
but it was a big front trying to like

1432
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:47,700
you know stand up there with the big

1433
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,780
guys and be like oh yeah it's our

1434
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,219
company you know this is what we're

1435
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,040
doing

1436
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:55,980
so yeah

1437
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,779
that's cool okay so we have this so we

1438
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,900
have a point at which like you know is

1439
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,960
the rise of Import Glass

1440
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:06,838
what what's the next kind of thing that

1441
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,300
y'all saw as being like a big thing like

1442
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:12,779
uh it's been um Michael I know that we

1443
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,500
mentioned Instagram at some point you

1444
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,780
know

1445
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,599
um emerging and and what that how that

1446
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:20,880
affected your scene as well was there

1447
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:24,180
anything else in between the Import

1448
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,818
Glass and Instagram or you know that you

1449
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:30,358
would consider significant

1450
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:32,338
no I I really think

1451
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,078
I think Instagram really changed

1452
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:35,940
everything yeah I put in front of people

1453
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,920
you know yeah y'all can dive into that

1454
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,679
tell us about that

1455
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,139
you know I I think the the whole

1456
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:46,078
Instagram era of glass has been really

1457
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:48,299
really interesting and it definitely it

1458
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,280
can mimic in some ways the seed business

1459
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,720
also because

1460
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,300
um I think originally when I got into

1461
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:56,879
glass blowing and in the Oregon scene it

1462
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,280
was a somewhat of a small

1463
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,280
it was still a small scene like the

1464
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,319
headies.com guys were super famous for

1465
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,119
making beautiful nice stuff and being at

1466
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,179
the top of their game and with Instagram

1467
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:12,539
you started seeing guys that I'd maybe

1468
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:13,980
never heard of or had never seen at a

1469
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:15,838
show

1470
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,818
um really getting on the scene and

1471
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,739
taking off and you start seeing these

1472
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:22,380
guys that you know they're on Instagram

1473
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:24,299
and they look very like the baller type

1474
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,940
thing going on like the compound guys

1475
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,980
you know in their jet setting and flying

1476
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,079
all over the world and they must make

1477
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,838
all this money in their glass blowers

1478
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:35,700
you know and so I had never seen that

1479
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,039
before I'd never you know as far as

1480
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:40,199
glass blowers I was like I know some of

1481
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,900
us make some money but I don't think

1482
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:45,480
anyone's getting rich off of it you know

1483
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:48,358
and so Instagram kind of changed that to

1484
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,880
where you know people are like oh these

1485
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:52,739
glass bars make so much money and you

1486
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,480
know some of the really talented guys

1487
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:56,338
would fall off a little and you wouldn't

1488
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,780
see them as much and you'd see these

1489
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:00,420
guys that maybe weren't making the

1490
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:03,059
greatest glass in the world just Rising

1491
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,980
like crazy and that was definitely a

1492
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,079
change in the industry oh for sure yeah

1493
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,119
social media did it for sure yeah I mean

1494
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:11,519
Facebook just kicked this all out you

1495
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,780
know they didn't want to do with it oh I

1496
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,338
can't have that that's not that's not

1497
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,839
enough I mean Instagram is starting too

1498
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:17,818
they're they're you know the leading

1499
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:19,799
accounts right left and yeah glass and

1500
00:56:17,818 --> 00:56:23,159
seeds Road the same wave that way I

1501
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,619
think like like as when when

1502
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:27,539
growing up we knew like there were some

1503
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:29,700
Dutch breeders that were pretty rich but

1504
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:32,579
the idea of an American breeder making

1505
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:34,618
serious money was a joke like right it

1506
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:36,359
was funny and then Instagram came around

1507
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:38,338
and you got to see like guys like flash

1508
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:40,318
and Rolexes and stuff and everybody

1509
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:42,299
assumed that all of us made a bunch of

1510
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:47,219
money and

1511
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:49,318
no no rent farmers at best I think the

1512
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:51,959
majority of the glassblowers that play

1513
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:56,000
that game too it probably has more to do

1514
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,000
with the family they come from than the

1515
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:01,379
um

1516
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:03,358
you're only going to sell so many

1517
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,980
fifteen thousand dollar pipes a year and

1518
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:06,779
you can really only make so many a year

1519
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,179
yes

1520
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,800
you know I think that's one of the big

1521
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:12,659
things that Instagram changed with the

1522
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,300
industry for sure yeah Instagram really

1523
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:17,460
uh introduced me more in detail into uh

1524
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,440
dabbing and uh what we can do with

1525
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:21,240
dabbing tools and concentrates and

1526
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,179
making pieces specifically for

1527
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:26,578
concentrates and just condense them down

1528
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:28,980
to smaller more effective little pieces

1529
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:31,859
that are more like for flavor and not so

1530
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:33,420
much for a volume of smoke or you know

1531
00:57:31,858 --> 00:57:35,159
the size of the piece that could be so

1532
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,559
big and so many percolors we're having

1533
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:39,539
one little perk that works perfect with

1534
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:42,180
enough of a chamber where it saves all

1535
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:43,739
the flavor of your concentrate and that

1536
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:44,940
that was another part of the line we

1537
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:46,739
introduced to when we started having

1538
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:50,119
these variety of pieces that are smaller

1539
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:52,799
and more Compact and uh just function

1540
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:54,000
ideally for concentrates and that was

1541
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,740
kind of an Instagram thing for me too

1542
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,659
because I started seeing more and more

1543
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:59,699
people getting into it and all the like

1544
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:03,598
the BHO stuff came and you know the

1545
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:06,179
rosin and all this sure coming out so I

1546
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,280
remember the first time we went to Vegas

1547
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:10,440
what was that little show was the age

1548
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:13,440
the small one at the hotel

1549
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,500
uh yeah age and it was the first time I

1550
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,659
had seen dab Riggs because uh I just it

1551
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,219
never been in my circle before and I

1552
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:22,078
remember we walked into the smoking room

1553
00:58:20,219 --> 00:58:24,058
and these guys are smoking on those dab

1554
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,559
rigs and I looked at Emma and I was like

1555
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:27,660
oh my god dude I think there's people

1556
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:28,980
freebasing in the corner over there I

1557
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:31,858
was like no dude they're just dabbing

1558
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:34,980
you know like I swear like it it tripped

1559
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:36,480
me out it'll do that it'll do that it

1560
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,219
looks it looks really weird at first

1561
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,960
when you first see it like especially if

1562
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:42,980
you've you've been around other worlds

1563
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,980
and stuff and you see that you're like

1564
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:49,919
yeah

1565
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:51,539
I mean this is this would be a weird

1566
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,880
tangent because I sort of asked you a

1567
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:56,639
little bit about it but I thought maybe

1568
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:00,180
y'all could actually do a bit of a like

1569
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,739
glass tick in two 2023 101 like what is

1570
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:03,118
a percolator

1571
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:06,298
what does it do

1572
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,380
it's gonna break the smoke up in the

1573
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:09,298
water

1574
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,180
so that

1575
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:13,980
I guess there's more surface area of

1576
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:15,598
smoke hitting water

1577
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,338
would you say yeah that's why different

1578
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,680
different perks work differently I think

1579
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:21,599
because when you have a smaller more uh

1580
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,519
concentrated perk you'll get small

1581
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,579
little tiny bubbles of smoke going

1582
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,440
through the water so essentially less

1583
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:30,660
smoke hits more water

1584
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,818
than having the big chuggy like both

1585
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:34,558
book action where like the big big

1586
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:36,000
bubbles come through and a lot of the

1587
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,260
smoke doesn't even touch the surface of

1588
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,318
the water because of the bubbles going

1589
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,900
through are larger so that makes sense

1590
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,880
yeah I mean was this was this piece of

1591
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,798
tech something that just like

1592
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,798
sort of came out of nowhere did it

1593
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:52,559
emerge slowly over time or I'd say it

1594
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:54,539
happened yeah using it just using it you

1595
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,460
realize that you get a smoother hit or

1596
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:58,139
you get a smoother smoke that it's not

1597
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,179
choking you up it's not you know you

1598
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:02,759
don't get that crazy cough afterwards or

1599
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:05,519
you just by you how did

1600
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:07,980
how did the idea even come about I guess

1601
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:12,858
well

1602
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:12,858
how did it come about I you know I'd say

1603
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:17,338
research and development this this is a

1604
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,858
really competitive industry like I'm

1605
01:00:17,338 --> 01:00:22,619
sure all Industries are but if you're

1606
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:25,500
not constantly coming out with something

1607
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,298
slightly different or new

1608
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,298
um You're Gonna Lose sales

1609
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:33,358
so we have we have two trade shows a

1610
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:35,099
year sometimes a few more than six well

1611
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:37,679
sometimes yeah yeah I'd like to not

1612
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:39,900
remember those but yeah let's let's say

1613
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,879
we have trade shows every year you need

1614
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,818
to have something new to get people

1615
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:47,579
excited about your product every time

1616
01:00:44,818 --> 01:00:49,019
you go and if you don't your company is

1617
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:53,099
going to get stale and people are gonna

1618
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:56,338
get bored so it's more a fact of hey how

1619
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:58,740
can we approve improve on designs that

1620
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:00,838
we already have how can we get this pipe

1621
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:03,000
to hit better how can we make the people

1622
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:05,338
that want a larger volume of smoke

1623
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,219
happier how do we get the people that

1624
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:09,719
want small volumes of smoke happier you

1625
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:11,399
know that's very true because we have

1626
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:14,098
pieces that have the same item code that

1627
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,599
they did 10 years ago but I don't want

1628
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:18,240
to say it looks completely different but

1629
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,280
it has progressed and has grown into the

1630
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,659
piece that is today but where it started

1631
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,960
and put them next to each other and

1632
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:27,118
you'll see that you know this is yeah

1633
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,619
not the same thing but it just kind of

1634
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,318
like grew into that

1635
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:33,358
yeah yeah I mean like uh you know like

1636
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:35,279
Michael was saying it's an extremely

1637
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:37,558
competitive environment so everyone's

1638
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,880
forced to evolve really fast right

1639
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,540
absolutely

1640
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,298
um

1641
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:45,119
okay what's a ratchet

1642
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:46,679
okay uh how would I describe that

1643
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,798
ratchet

1644
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:51,118
um is the perk that that it's like a

1645
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:53,880
disc with cuts at the end think about

1646
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,559
like a uh a ratcheting tool that has a

1647
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,420
Sprocket in it when you know it clicks

1648
01:01:55,559 --> 01:02:00,000
when you try to tighten the bolt or a

1649
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,559
nut and and that's the inner part of it

1650
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,619
and that's what we called it a ratchet

1651
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:06,480
because it was the actual uh the perk in

1652
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:09,480
the piece kind of reminded me of the the

1653
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,119
gear that's inside the ratchet uh I have

1654
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,500
I have because of this uh site up on

1655
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:15,480
here and I'm trying to find where on the

1656
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,559
site I could show it ratchet oh you just

1657
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:20,519
lost a bunch um I'm pretty sure

1658
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,839
the color pieces in the beginning you

1659
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:24,838
show even the artwork ones they have

1660
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:26,519
ratchet perks where those all the whole

1661
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,798
Top Line well except the one on the

1662
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:31,019
right is ratchet parts all right yeah

1663
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,659
when you go down you'll see the cuts

1664
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:34,858
right there

1665
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:38,598
when we look at it from the bottom or

1666
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:42,480
the top it looks like a gear right yeah

1667
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:44,599
so it's a specific kind of perk yes yeah

1668
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,599
yeah

1669
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:49,500
right that one's really really sick I

1670
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,358
like that it's cool yeah

1671
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,280
yeah y'all I think y'all have no idea

1672
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,838
how many people are like will be

1673
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,440
learning encountering this for the very

1674
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:57,440
first time

1675
01:02:57,739 --> 01:03:02,639
which is more predominant in a lot of

1676
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,318
different companies ratchet perks we

1677
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:05,578
came up with it it's our thing and

1678
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:08,338
there's a lot a few different companies

1679
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:10,519
that make it now and um but yeah it was

1680
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:14,460
our thing and we're Kings of ratchets

1681
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:17,420
the ratchet Kings yeah I mean yeah like

1682
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:20,220
as a strained strained person and like

1683
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:23,338
when I got into weed I really like

1684
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:24,959
narrowly focused my my experience and

1685
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:27,420
view on what I really really really

1686
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,740
wanted to learn about and glass has

1687
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,019
always been something I'm interested in

1688
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:33,899
but never really jumped into because one

1689
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:37,079
it is so expensive and when I go into

1690
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,519
collecting anything I go all in and I

1691
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:40,318
never wanted to go all in there because

1692
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:41,579
that's all you can you can spend upwards

1693
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:44,039
of a hundred thousand dollars on one

1694
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:47,339
piece yeah easy reasons out there you

1695
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:48,779
know yeah so yeah so all this is still

1696
01:03:47,338 --> 01:03:50,159
new to me too and I think there's gonna

1697
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,740
be a lot of people that that have been

1698
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,960
around for a long time that use pieces

1699
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:57,539
that don't know much about the actual

1700
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,000
industry the form what's gone into it

1701
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:02,099
the history and any of it so this is

1702
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,260
really really cool go back to the top of

1703
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:06,059
the page there's a gallery section if

1704
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,099
you hit that

1705
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:10,079
um

1706
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:11,160
yeah or actually the catalogs are well

1707
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,420
yeah you can see one of the ratchets

1708
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:14,639
being made here that's the base being

1709
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:18,059
blown out and you can see the ratchets

1710
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:19,500
inside but if you go to a catalog a lot

1711
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:21,960
of the clear pieces are in there as well

1712
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:24,059
and you'll be able to see

1713
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,179
um our production line from simple

1714
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:29,280
beakers to simple ratchet and just gets

1715
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:32,338
bigger and crazier and crazier

1716
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,839
and those yeah Parts in those pieces

1717
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:36,298
because they are clear

1718
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:38,818
let's see I don't let me see if I can uh

1719
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:40,759
get mine up here I think this is like

1720
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:44,420
double ratchet five millimeter double

1721
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,420
ratchet yeah yeah

1722
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,380
that is Matt's custom logo

1723
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:00,480
one of the luckiest places to get

1724
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:02,400
affordable American glasses right

1725
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,358
through the greater Syndicate patreon

1726
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,358
right there

1727
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:09,358
I'm sorry I didn't catch what you said

1728
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,679
um thousand yeah go ahead that's okay

1729
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:11,279
that's okay

1730
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:13,139
um

1731
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,400
what's a recycler is that something

1732
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:18,358
that's relevant to what you guys make um

1733
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,858
I think there's one right there you

1734
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:22,440
passed it

1735
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:24,719
right there no that's not recycled

1736
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,760
um now you guys scroll more but it

1737
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:28,798
recycles the water so the essentially

1738
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,559
the the water that the smoke bubbles

1739
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,000
through it it'll pull the bubbles it'll

1740
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:35,040
pull the smoke and the water in a

1741
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,960
certain chamber and it will separate the

1742
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:39,000
smoke to go up to the mouthpiece and the

1743
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,318
water will go back down into the bottom

1744
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,358
of the piece so essentially the water

1745
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:43,338
keeps circulating around the piece over

1746
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:45,598
and over

1747
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:48,000
and that that is the recycling action

1748
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,619
and we introduced a recycler back in the

1749
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,940
day it was an internal recycler and most

1750
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:53,338
people didn't even know what the [ __ ]

1751
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:54,838
was going on it just didn't take off

1752
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:56,578
because of that because people didn't

1753
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,078
understand it you know we didn't explain

1754
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:59,400
it very well yeah we just made it

1755
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,619
through it out there and a few people

1756
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,780
were so [ __ ] stoked about it and most

1757
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:05,099
people were like what's going on you

1758
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:06,900
know like I don't understand what the

1759
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:08,700
what the thing is but now recycles are

1760
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:11,160
huge and every company has recyclers it

1761
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:13,199
doesn't always pay to be first yeah in

1762
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:15,358
the industry it doesn't sometimes

1763
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:18,480
sometimes it'll be too early it's like

1764
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,920
I'm and I'm not I'm not a Dabber but

1765
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,260
um recyclers are one of the most

1766
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,480
overrated things I think in glass as far

1767
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,920
as glass water pipes I have no idea if

1768
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,599
you're a carnosurer and you get really

1769
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,920
into it it's like the way you hit a

1770
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,240
recycler is different you kind of start

1771
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,039
hitting it before you put your

1772
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:34,199
concentrate on it you got to kind of get

1773
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:36,000
the water circulating and doing its

1774
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:38,460
thing before you put your introduce your

1775
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:43,099
concentrate so it does so yeah it's very

1776
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:43,099
you know like that's what I say yeah

1777
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:48,780
okay that makes a lot more sense then I

1778
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:51,059
I don't smoke concentrate okay I was one

1779
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,579
of the people that used recyclers for

1780
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:55,680
for a week because I thought they hit

1781
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:57,839
smoother but you did kind of have to hit

1782
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,338
like like it hit it like yeah yeah

1783
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,460
there's a cinder way you got to smoke it

1784
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:05,099
and it's like uh very unfortunate you

1785
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:06,720
know but it is it's great it does you

1786
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:08,099
know it does what it needs to do it does

1787
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:10,679
cool a little bit better you can use

1788
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:12,660
more water with the recycles tend to

1789
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:15,058
have more water and this is why we only

1790
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:18,858
kept one recircular in our line uh which

1791
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,859
is the mini one and uh

1792
01:07:19,099 --> 01:07:22,859
it's small but because of the recycling

1793
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,659
action we're able to put a lot more

1794
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:26,219
water into it otherwise if you didn't

1795
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:27,838
have the recycling chamber it would suck

1796
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:29,759
up the water through the mouthpiece

1797
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:31,619
right it was just like a straw so the

1798
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,180
recycling chamber kind of lets you put

1799
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:34,980
more water and it separates the water

1800
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:36,298
and the smoke so you don't get that

1801
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:38,159
splash of water in your mouth and the

1802
01:07:36,298 --> 01:07:41,519
water shoots back down

1803
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:45,058
I was a big fan of recyclers for or

1804
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:46,619
until I got this ratchet they're like a

1805
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:48,839
double ratchet one and that I was done I

1806
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:50,220
was like oh my god I've been leveled up

1807
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:53,420
in your mind but we have ratchet

1808
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:55,919
recyclers oh my God

1809
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:57,720
but the thing is like these are easy to

1810
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,280
clean too and that was like another big

1811
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:02,399
part of it because it's like yeah like

1812
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,660
you have mine always clean and all this

1813
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,280
is very easy to clean even the ash

1814
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:07,379
catcher and usually ash catchers are

1815
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,940
paying the ass to claim

1816
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,880
that's one of the things we keep in mind

1817
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:13,858
both of us yeah we [ __ ] hate dirty

1818
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:16,380
pieces so making it easy to clean is

1819
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:19,380
part of the functionality for us yeah

1820
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:22,619
yeah I'm so jealous Matt like I pray

1821
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:27,000
that one day uh I will get magic one of

1822
01:08:22,619 --> 01:08:27,000
those no yeah yeah

1823
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,880
okay um through the magic of TV

1824
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:37,440
oh it didn't work

1825
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,179
um that was a really really cool dive

1826
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,798
into the tech

1827
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:44,100
um and if we I don't know I was

1828
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:46,859
wondering if we want to come back to

1829
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:48,480
the timeline you know where what have

1830
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:50,640
you all been doing in the last few years

1831
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,858
like what was covet like you know what

1832
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,719
was what if the last few years been like

1833
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:57,539
for you guys well it's been kind of

1834
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,579
crazy uh my father passed away uh seven

1835
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:02,159
years ago he was diagnosed with lung

1836
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:04,798
cancer and uh unfortunately he didn't

1837
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:06,838
beat it and um

1838
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,179
a lot of different things happened the

1839
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:10,979
Dynamics of the shop changed the whole

1840
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:13,560
vibe of the place changed because he was

1841
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:15,119
a he was a very big presence in both of

1842
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,880
our lives really

1843
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:20,099
um and then um well the original spot we

1844
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,659
were at we moved in on a handshake

1845
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:23,640
didn't even really have information on

1846
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:25,079
me until that landlord passed away

1847
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,000
because so many years are going by and

1848
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:30,000
people are getting older you know and

1849
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,759
now a new company took it over they

1850
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,380
wanted more rent they didn't want us

1851
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:35,939
using propane I'm like if I can't use

1852
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,400
propane I can't have fire if I can't

1853
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:40,019
have fire I can't make anything so

1854
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,238
you're kicking me out basically you know

1855
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:44,100
and so we had to worry about moving to a

1856
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:46,500
different place and dealing with all

1857
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:49,259
kinds of things and the Dynamics of the

1858
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:51,420
company changing and then covet hit and

1859
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:53,219
it was crazy it was good for a little

1860
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,899
while where everybody had the stimulus

1861
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:56,698
money and they were spending it on this

1862
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:58,619
and that the business was good but then

1863
01:09:56,698 --> 01:10:02,519
that all changed and died out and we had

1864
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:05,159
to actually stay relevant as um because

1865
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,080
we were essential we were essential

1866
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:10,198
because there was a splitter that was

1867
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:11,760
used for a a ventilator thing for the

1868
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:14,399
hospital that we never actually got into

1869
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,920
I tried but the logistics for that was

1870
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:18,659
uh [ __ ] ridiculous but because of

1871
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,340
that one thing we're able to stay

1872
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:21,479
working when it was only essential

1873
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:25,319
workers only

1874
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:27,119
oh wow so yeah you know that kind of

1875
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:28,559
helped us stay in business because we

1876
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:29,640
otherwise we couldn't really go back and

1877
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,800
forth from work

1878
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,600
but yeah it was a crazy time man like a

1879
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,060
lot of things changed and we just kind

1880
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,060
of took it took it as a cane

1881
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:40,260
in as far as living in Los Angeles and

1882
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,900
this is for me personally I'm not

1883
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,400
speaking for Hamlet but uh covet had to

1884
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:46,619
be one of the best times of my life

1885
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:48,079
because all of a sudden there was no

1886
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:51,119
traffic

1887
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:53,158
I was living in Eugene again I didn't

1888
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:54,119
have to see anyone

1889
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:56,879
um

1890
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:59,399
it was quiet our business complex was

1891
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,020
empty it was it reminded me of living in

1892
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:02,460
the country again yeah it was a

1893
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,040
beautiful time we had more orders than

1894
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:06,539
you could possibly imagine

1895
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:08,219
um we were still working with the same

1896
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:10,738
people that we work with and get to hang

1897
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:14,119
out with every day I'm a you know a

1898
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:16,379
little somewhat anti-social so

1899
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:18,359
it just basically I didn't have to deal

1900
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:20,819
with all the crazy people and all the

1901
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:22,079
traffic and everything about La that I

1902
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:23,579
didn't like yeah we're both kind of like

1903
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:25,500
hermit crabs we don't really like to do

1904
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:28,019
much yeah no

1905
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,939
yeah I don't blame you la does that to

1906
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:31,620
people though too I mean it's a very

1907
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:33,719
fast-paced City and you're everybody's

1908
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:36,599
so around each other yeah making very

1909
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:39,300
anti-social real fast yeah where I am

1910
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:42,000
sitting it just looks like exhausting to

1911
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:45,060
be out in an environment like that

1912
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,039
it can't be it really can be you kind of

1913
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:51,420
have to like find your piece you know

1914
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:52,859
like yeah for sure and weed helps a lot

1915
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,060
yeah

1916
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:56,939
sorry man what were you going to say

1917
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,620
about Bakersfield I know like we were

1918
01:11:56,939 --> 01:12:00,238
one of the few places where covet just

1919
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:01,319
didn't change anything because nobody

1920
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:03,299
you like

1921
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:05,460
everybody here was like ah that didn't

1922
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:07,440
happen this didn't exist yeah so nothing

1923
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:09,000
changed like everybody was just out

1924
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:11,059
shopping

1925
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,579
if you wear a mask it was weird

1926
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:16,260
in L.A everyone would be masked up and

1927
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:19,500
like hardly anyone's leaving their house

1928
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:21,600
and then we drove to Idaho for a trip in

1929
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,219
like maybe an hour and a half we got the

1930
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,380
bishop like an hour and a half out of La

1931
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:26,939
we stopped at a store and it's like

1932
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:30,300
covet never was happening this is like

1933
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:32,279

1935
01:12:32,279 --> 01:12:35,579
well San when I went out to Alaska I was

1936
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:37,079
like what the hell is this is only on

1937
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:39,359
the news over here you know it's a whole

1938
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:41,819
different world yeah yeah we were like a

1939
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:44,039
little island in California of that

1940
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:46,679

1948
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:04,259
it did affect some things like you know

1949
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,960
delivery of liquid oxygen and propane

1950
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:08,940
and uh regular deliveries of glass

1951
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,880
coming in because you know our glass was

1952
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:13,738
from Germany and it it broke her to a a

1953
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,420
different company that that supplies us

1954
01:13:13,738 --> 01:13:17,339
and that was a lot of issues with like

1955
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:20,100
the shipping and the back backlog of

1956
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:21,060
ships and all that so there was a lot of

1957
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,039
issues with trying to get everything

1958
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:24,179
because luckily we had enough of a back

1959
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:26,519
stock to

1960
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:28,319
kind of just work through it and and

1961
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,080
change up some designs and things to

1962
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:34,019
meet uh the sizing and tubings that we

1963
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:36,600
have instead of what we can get you know

1964
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:38,760
and they did cancel those shows so that

1965
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,739
was really nice too yeah yeah we had

1966
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:43,199
like a whole year almost of no trade

1967
01:13:40,738 --> 01:13:45,539
shows it was amazing yeah trade shows

1968
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:47,219
are brutal they are brutal brutal people

1969
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:48,719
don't understand if you don't know to be

1970
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:49,920
a certain kind of person we hate them we

1971
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,600
don't we don't like doing the trade

1972
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,840
shows we have to when we do do them but

1973
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:57,120
we I I can't stand them yeah as a small

1974
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,980
business owner you have to sell in order

1975
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:00,960
to make money you have to be a Salesman

1976
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:02,279
and just for certain people like for me

1977
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,539
and I know you guys probably are the

1978
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,779
same where it's just like you have to

1979
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:08,819
force yourself to do things like that at

1980
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:12,619
all like I can't sell [ __ ] and then

1981
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:12,619
eight hours a day of it

1982
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:20,580
so the trade shows like we you know we

1983
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:22,619
don't fit in yeah I know I know that

1984
01:14:20,579 --> 01:14:24,000
feeling I know that feeling it must be a

1985
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:26,819
really strange

1986
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,539
must be a really strange performance

1987
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:29,539
I mean sometimes you know

1988
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:39,600
you know business sales and and just

1989
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:42,140
like putting up a front that's annoying

1990
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,140
yeah

1991
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:47,339
okay well is there anything else that

1992
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:49,678
y'all wanted to highlight about you know

1993
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:51,300
your overall Journey especially recently

1994
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,500
because otherwise we can actually segue

1995
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,800
into like

1996
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:58,439
more like open chat I know uh Michael

1997
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,659
you had a few other kind of like stories

1998
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:02,039
anecdotes about

1999
01:15:00,658 --> 01:15:04,259
um strains that you encountered maybe

2000
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:07,140
but yes anything else you wanted to say

2001
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:08,159
about you know recent years

2002
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,600
I

2003
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:11,399
I don't know

2004
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,579
since you guys probably don't know a lot

2005
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:16,559
about the well it seems like it would be

2006
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:18,238
apparent to me but

2007
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,620
um the early glass blowing scene in

2008
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,259
Eugene I can talk a little bit about

2009
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:24,059
that in uh where I was fortunate maybe

2010
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:26,820
where I wasn't

2011
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:30,360
um that first glass shop that I worked

2012
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:33,840
at was called Advanced Glassworks it

2013
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:36,738
turned into Cascade glass works and then

2014
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,739
turned into

2015
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:40,439
um

2016
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:43,319
Cornerstone Glass Works where's like the

2017
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:44,339
DFO and all that stuff takes place you

2018
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:46,500
know so there were a lot of glass

2019
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:49,319
blowers coming through

2020
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,420
um I had left I think I only worked at

2021
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:52,679
that shop for maybe about seven months

2022
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:55,199
before

2023
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:56,699
I basically figured out I had uh

2024
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:59,879
basically my best friend little Chris

2025
01:15:56,698 --> 01:16:02,339
that grew up with me there in Eugene uh

2026
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,840
we were both working there and uh we

2027
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:06,539
looked at it and we were like hey you

2028
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,539
know we could buy these torches on our

2029
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:11,158
own and all these supplies and just do

2030
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:14,519
this in our garage

2031
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:17,039
and uh that's pretty much what we did we

2032
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,600
went out on our own we had very limited

2033
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,359
knowledge at the time

2034
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:23,820
um we got really lucky though because we

2035
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:26,460
ran into a handful of people

2036
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:30,059
um there was a guy named Maddie that was

2037
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:31,920
uh I was friends with through a couple

2038
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,659
other glass blowers from that shop that

2039
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,880
would teach us really cool different

2040
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:39,059
techniques

2041
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:42,000
um we went to a Hemp Fest at Bill

2042
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:45,179
conde's place which is in Oregon it used

2043
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:49,198
to be like a yearly Gathering and uh

2044
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:51,960
that's where I met Marcel and I asked

2045
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:54,139
him about teaching me techniques and he

2046
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:58,319
was very generous with information

2047
01:16:54,140 --> 01:17:01,020
and uh it kind of leapfrogged me to

2048
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,719
being able to support myself without

2049
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,460
having to work for other people you know

2050
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,920
and I I feel like I was really fortunate

2051
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:09,539
because back then people really held the

2052
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,460
information tight they didn't want to

2053
01:17:09,539 --> 01:17:14,819
share any techniques they didn't on

2054
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:16,800
anyone stealing their Thunder and uh I

2055
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:19,920
just I I've got real fortunate that

2056
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,520
those those two groups of people

2057
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,319
um

2058
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:24,239
kind of taught me techniques that

2059
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:27,238
carried me all the way to California and

2060
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:30,718
being able to start a small company on

2061
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:33,419
my own you know most of the guys that I

2062
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,520
originally learned to blow glass with uh

2063
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:39,000
stalled out and quit because we didn't

2064
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:41,540
have the the education that Hamlet was

2065
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,238
able to get through his dad and his dad

2066
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:46,079
where he wanted to teach me everything

2067
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:49,319
instead of trying to keep them when you

2068
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:51,179
go to class or you take a glassblowing

2069
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:52,559
studies or anything like that there's a

2070
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,940
lot of information they don't pass along

2071
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,219
because they don't want they don't want

2072
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:57,719
it to pass like you said they don't want

2073
01:17:56,219 --> 01:17:58,980
it to get to other people's hands they

2074
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:01,619
didn't want to leave them they want to

2075
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:02,759
keep the art to themselves but with me I

2076
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:04,920
was it was the other way around he

2077
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,260
wanted to teach me everything he knew

2078
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,699
you know and yeah I was fortunate in

2079
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:10,320
that aspect of it

2080
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:12,599
oh my God it's like it's like people

2081
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:15,840
with clones in the in the weed world

2082
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:18,480
like how in certain groups loans to some

2083
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,779
but don't pass it to that guy yeah that

2084
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:23,339
makes sense right and there'd be like

2085
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:26,039
trade baiting type of things going on

2086
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:27,719
where oh I'm sure you know I I'd run

2087
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:29,939
into someone that would tell you how to

2088
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:32,100
incorrectly do a technique so that they

2089
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:36,619
could roll you off that path you know

2090
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:41,760
similar to hey this is Kim D when wow

2091
01:18:36,619 --> 01:18:43,380
yeah it's so dirty it's so dirty it'd be

2092
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,940
a simple little like you know tips and

2093
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:46,500
tricks that are part of the trade you

2094
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:47,939
know unless they tell you like you're

2095
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,260
watching it you might not even catch it

2096
01:18:47,939 --> 01:18:51,359
because it's a Split Second

2097
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:53,159
of what can happen that you didn't see

2098
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,479
because very minute things in Glasgow

2099
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:56,879
make a big difference

2100
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,899
so you know it's just like that like you

2101
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,900
said it

2102
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:04,198
people kept the things to themselves

2103
01:19:00,899 --> 01:19:06,658
you know and uh thousand I know this may

2104
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:08,759
be a little less to do with

2105
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:10,679
um the glass but I wouldn't mind talking

2106
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:13,500
about some of the herb that I saw go

2107
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:16,079
through those shops between uh oh yeah

2108
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:18,960
let's do it Baker design I think we're

2109
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:20,640
ready for that yeah you know because

2110
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,439
um obviously I've heard not so talk

2111
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,900
about some of them and some of that

2112
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:26,698
information he gets from guys that I

2113
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:29,879
blew glass with and that were real close

2114
01:19:26,698 --> 01:19:31,919
friends of mine in Eugene you know

2115
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,859
um there's so many strains from Eugene

2116
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:37,640
bro

2117
01:19:33,859 --> 01:19:40,859
these glassblowing circles in Eugene

2118
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:43,260
you know uh before the Bubba kushes and

2119
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:46,079
the OG cushions I'd never seen those uh

2120
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:49,380
in in Oregon at least at that point but

2121
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:54,179
uh I do remember very early on

2122
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:56,699
I'd say 96 97 we've started seeing a lot

2123
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:58,020
of blueberries

2124
01:19:56,698 --> 01:20:01,019
um

2125
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:02,699
not dj I know Matt might disagree with

2126
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,860
this but they weren't DJ Short

2127
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:06,359
blueberries it's very possible no I

2128
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:08,819
don't disagree with that that it seems

2129
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:11,158
to be there's stories of I've seen so

2130
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:14,399
many seeds popped from DJ and I just

2131
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:17,279
never saw the blueberry we were getting

2132
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:20,579
past yeah you know it had a really

2133
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:24,059
really distinct nose on it and it had a

2134
01:20:20,579 --> 01:20:26,939
spicy pure blueberry fruit Jam taste to

2135
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:29,719
it it had real Crimson hairs and they

2136
01:20:26,939 --> 01:20:31,439
were that little round notes

2137
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:33,899
you know

2138
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:36,899
um the Trinity I remember the first time

2139
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:38,399
that came through super early

2140
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:41,399
um that's not the ones I wanted to hear

2141
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:43,319
about yeah absolutely amazing I know not

2142
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:45,658
so and I have different descriptions of

2143
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,939
what we get from it but I think some of

2144
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:50,519
that has to do with what we think a

2145
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:53,099
skunk is I know he he's mentioned the

2146
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,260
Trinity being really skunky to me that

2147
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:58,620
wasn't really skunky that had more of

2148
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:02,039
like a soft pillowy sour skunk

2149
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:04,920
you get the to it whereas we used to get

2150
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:08,939
a strain in Eugene called the Mudbud or

2151
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:11,520
The Afghani Thai and it was long Spears

2152
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:14,879
it was really really dark green with

2153
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:18,960
orange hairs and it's smelled like dead

2154
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:21,600
skunk for a long ways away oh wow and it

2155
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,060
was the skunkiest thing we ever seen you

2156
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,940
know I I don't know if it's the same

2157
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:29,219
kind of Super Skunk the guys that had it

2158
01:21:26,939 --> 01:21:30,899
in Oregon were bikers

2159
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:32,640
um but it was the skunkiest weed we had

2160
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:34,379
ever seen I mean if it's an Afghani Tai

2161
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:36,300
if they got that right it wouldn't be a

2162
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,619
super skunk it sounds awesome though it

2163
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:39,420
sounds like you know what I mean like

2164
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:41,819
yeah I think there's skunky weed way

2165
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:44,520
outside of Super Skunk I just think what

2166
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:46,679
super skunk has is some of the best and

2167
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:49,199
most accessible versions of it that we

2168
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:51,300
have but there's got to be like a lot

2169
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:53,399
more out there this pure afghanis and

2170
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:55,619
different things and different hybrids

2171
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:57,299
from different eras that are like that

2172
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:59,460
and it's so hard if you haven't

2173
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,260
experienced what you know for a hundred

2174
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:03,658
percent is super skunk

2175
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:05,460
it's hard to know yeah because yeah

2176
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:07,379
always from where I'm sitting maybe I'd

2177
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:09,179
see Super Stone can be like oh my God

2178
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,340
that's even skunkier than that Afghan

2179
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:14,340
yeah you know but from my experience

2180
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:17,940
that was the skunkiest thing I had seen

2181
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:22,140
um we used to get amazing AK-47 at that

2182
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:23,399
shop just big pillowy pretty buds what

2183
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,619
was that do you remember the scent on

2184
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:27,839
the AK-47 you guys saw I thought it

2185
01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:28,979
smelled like Sandalwood okay so you guys

2186
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,480
got the sandal what do you type I've

2187
01:22:28,979 --> 01:22:32,879
heard of that one there's a really

2188
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,019
lovely spicy Woody

2189
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,679
yeah

2190
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:38,840
you know I I've never seen the Cherry

2191
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:42,779

2192
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:44,219
Jerry's nice guy and uh Maui Wowie and

2193
01:22:42,779 --> 01:22:46,198
[ __ ] white widow coming through

2194
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:47,640
randomly back in the days and it was

2195
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:49,259
like I don't know where it came from who

2196
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:51,539
had it but it just ended up at the shop

2197
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:54,179
you know how was it how did you like it

2198
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:57,060
I loved it um the [ __ ] white widow

2199
01:22:54,179 --> 01:23:00,119
that I experienced back then it was

2200
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:02,640
frostiest like just snow-covered looking

2201
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:04,439
buds I've ever seen in my life and it

2202
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,280
tasted amazing

2203
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:08,399
um

2204
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:10,679
yeah I don't know where or where it

2205
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,238
originated or who had it what but like I

2206
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:13,500
said ended up at the shop and the

2207
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,658
chocolate tattoo that was random that

2208
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,760
was from an old veteran buddy of mine

2209
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:19,259
that I had he just randomly came up with

2210
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,520
some chocolate ties like I know I know

2211
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:24,780
you never smoked this before check this

2212
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:26,360
out you know you know wow he just

2213
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:28,619
busting out like Thai stick

2214
01:23:26,359 --> 01:23:31,259
and then I looked into it more and I was

2215
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:33,559
more and more amazed by it yeah that's

2216
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:33,560
awesome

2217
01:23:33,899 --> 01:23:38,698
um the Trinity I have to agree with you

2218
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:40,560
like but there is questions about like

2219
01:23:38,698 --> 01:23:42,658
whether the Trinity cut that we have now

2220
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,520
is the same as the old Trinity cut you

2221
01:23:42,658 --> 01:23:46,738
know but the one that we have now that

2222
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,080
people say and they smell smell skunky

2223
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:51,178
to me it doesn't smell skunky it smells

2224
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:54,679
musty like that's about the best I can

2225
01:23:51,179 --> 01:23:57,420
get it's musty it's not sweet

2226
01:23:54,679 --> 01:23:59,699
and then I just leave it there because I

2227
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:02,699
can't my nose can't develop it much more

2228
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:05,759
but it's not skunky as I would qualify

2229
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:08,339
it you know yeah I the one I remember

2230
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,440
wasn't either I remember when the snow

2231
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:13,199
first came into Eugene about that same

2232
01:24:10,439 --> 01:24:15,119
time that the Trinity did that one was

2233
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:18,299
excellent

2234
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:20,099
um we used to get a Korean skunk there

2235
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:22,760
in Eugene and I can't remember if that

2236
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:26,340
was from Amos

2237
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:28,020
I don't remember if it was I think it

2238
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,360
probably was he's the only person I've

2239
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:32,699
ever seen have a Korean skunk ever yeah

2240
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:35,880
it made its way through Eugene it was a

2241
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:38,339
really spicy purple haired nice little

2242
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,260
Frosty buds I would love to experience

2243
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:42,480
that that was great

2244
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:45,360
um it's like a backbone of a lot of his

2245
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:47,819
lines my favorite out of all of them was

2246
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:50,099
uh that quindy when that Quimby came

2247
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:51,719
into the shop the first time it was one

2248
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,600
of the most impressive strains I'd ever

2249
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:57,300
seen the nose was just so unique and it

2250
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,640
smelled so strong and it wasn't skunk

2251
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:01,679
strong it was more of uh

2252
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,179
just I don't know like some kind of

2253
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,460
candied

2254
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:06,899
um Candy dank I don't know how to

2255
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,158
describe it

2256
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,139
but

2257
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:12,719
um some of those old school stuff that I

2258
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:14,159
I can remember to this when when I get

2259
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,779
something today and it's like oh it's

2260
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:17,879
this or that I'm like I don't remember

2261
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:19,439
it this way I don't remember and like it

2262
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,300
smelled different to me it was you know

2263
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:22,259
and I can never almost I can never find

2264
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,760
it again

2265
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:25,619
yeah

2266
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,239
it's pretty common because like a lot of

2267
01:25:25,619 --> 01:25:28,439
people didn't keep those same old cuts

2268
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:30,658
and you know they just didn't stay

2269
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:32,698
popular and sometimes they get a second

2270
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:34,198
wind and people just try to capitalize

2271
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:35,759
on the name and don't have access to

2272
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:38,639
those groups or those cuts they kept

2273
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,500
them yeah so a few people do

2274
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,380
yeah I feel like I just repeated a whole

2275
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:46,079
not so statement right there

2276
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:48,420
could have just inserted him

2277
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:51,719
you know we used to get some really nice

2278
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:53,039
Northern Lights that's uh not I mean we

2279
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:56,219
would get Northern Lights number five

2280
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:59,060
too also that was super boring but we

2281
01:25:56,219 --> 01:26:01,260
would get like a dank dark green

2282
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:03,120
Northern Lights that was really really

2283
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:05,239
nice

2284
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:05,238
um

2285
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,840
those are the strains that I really

2286
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:13,139
remember like circulating heavily

2287
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:15,179
in those shops like we would always have

2288
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:17,639
access to one of those and they were

2289
01:26:15,179 --> 01:26:20,399
always good there's a few others I just

2290
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:21,900
can't remember the name of anymore there

2291
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,960
was a couple hash plants that had

2292
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:28,460
special names Hench but that was when I

2293
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,460
came to California yeah yeah

2294
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:35,519
yeah you said Amos and I just realized

2295
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,840
most people have no idea who you're

2296
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,820
talking about or who we're talking about

2297
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:41,600
you're referring to Soma Amos Washington

2298
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,599
yeah

2299
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:46,800
yeah and and what you're talking about

2300
01:26:43,979 --> 01:26:48,359
is the backbone I think to Lavender and

2301
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,800
stuff like that

2302
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:51,299
um did you have a lot of experience with

2303
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,159
him there did you ever have run-ins

2304
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,940
within there or any of that you gotta

2305
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:54,779
remember

2306
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:58,138
um

2307
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:59,880
we were pretty young I'm trying to think

2308
01:26:58,139 --> 01:27:03,960
thanks for stopping man into him I was

2309
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:07,800
probably 15 years old yeah and uh he was

2310
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:10,980
well known for uh dry sifting his bag

2311
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:14,520
but you got him so you could go and get

2312
01:27:10,979 --> 01:27:16,859
weed from Amos and uh you'd look at it

2313
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,060
and it's still it was still good weed we

2314
01:27:16,859 --> 01:27:20,279
didn't really know any better to be

2315
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:22,500
honest with you but what you could be

2316
01:27:20,279 --> 01:27:24,420
guaranteed is that Amos would [ __ ]

2317
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,819
bong hit of about the best sift you

2318
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:30,719
could ever imagine that you just paid

2319
01:27:26,819 --> 01:27:32,639
for yeah you know and the reason his

2320
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:35,880
buds were always a very uniform

2321
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:38,039
roundness to them in the same size yeah

2322
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:41,219
so funny dude they look like bags of

2323
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:44,760
like the little marbles yeah you know

2324
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:46,920
but um but he did that story before yeah

2325
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,139
he had great weed there was a you know

2326
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:51,920
Eugene had a lot of those weird older

2327
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:54,359
hippie characters in it that

2328
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,699
every once in a while take advantage of

2329
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:57,859
younger kids you know in one way or

2330
01:27:56,698 --> 01:28:00,539
another

2331
01:27:57,859 --> 01:28:03,238
I remember there was this guy I got

2332
01:28:00,539 --> 01:28:06,359
introduced to named Michael golden

2333
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:09,299
and he swore up and down the eagle Bill

2334
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:11,399
stole his design for the vaporizer at

2335
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:14,179
the High Times Cannabis Cup

2336
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:16,920
and would just gets so angry about it

2337
01:28:14,179 --> 01:28:18,600
you know and uh he was the first one I

2338
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,819
saw with that heat gun and it was a real

2339
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:22,980
vaporizer but

2340
01:28:20,819 --> 01:28:27,299
um what he had that really impressed me

2341
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:28,859
Matt was he had about 20 packs of seeds

2342
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:32,340
and this was

2343
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:37,079
okay I was probably 17 at the time

2344
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:40,679
so this had to be like 94 maybe 95

2345
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:43,198
94. and uh he had these packs of seeds

2346
01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:47,940
that were from Corvallis Oregon with

2347
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:50,039
this really cool Beaver logo on them and

2348
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:52,500
he would tell me like each one of these

2349
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:54,840
varieties and they were created

2350
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:57,420
um early 80s and he's been holding on to

2351
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:00,239
them forever and that was like the first

2352
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:04,020
time I ever really saw packaged seeds

2353
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:07,319

Michael that you wanted to touch on that

2388
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:32,039
we discussed yesterday one was your

2389
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:33,658
first year in California and the other

2390
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:36,300
one was Josh d

2391
01:30:33,658 --> 01:30:38,399
which one we always do that oh you know

2392
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:40,500
it was it was not necessarily just Josh

2393
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:44,339
D it was my experience with uh getting

2394
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:46,920
introduced to Californian weed because

2395
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:49,020
um what a lot of my friends nowadays

2396
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,658
have a hard time believing

2397
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:54,659
is that uh this is kind of off topic

2398
01:30:51,658 --> 01:30:56,158
thousand I'm sorry but every once in a

2399
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:58,799
while during harvest season in Oregon

2400
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:01,738
guys would bring up weed from Humboldt

2401
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,320
that was outdoor and it was so [ __ ]

2402
01:31:01,738 --> 01:31:07,738
good and everyone always had this thing

2403
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:10,559
where oh Outdoors mids you know it's not

2404
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:13,259
that great indoor is like the Holy Ghost

2405
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:16,679
I remember getting outdoor weed that was

2406
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:18,780
so good from some of those kids that it

2407
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:21,179
rivaled any indoor I'd ever had

2408
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:22,738
you know and uh even Hamlet I've had

2409
01:31:21,179 --> 01:31:24,000
this argue with them a million times

2410
01:31:22,738 --> 01:31:26,519
where he's like I've never seen good

2411
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,679
outdoor weed I'm telling them it just

2412
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:32,520
doesn't get here we don't know the right

2413
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:35,639
people here it exists you know do you

2414
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:37,679
disagree man I just didn't I don't know

2415
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:39,420
I you know what but I don't have much

2416
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:41,158
experience with it so I can't speak on

2417
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:42,658
it you know what I mean like I want to

2418
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:45,839
say I haven't seen it because I haven't

2419
01:31:42,658 --> 01:31:47,759
but I also didn't live in an epicenter

2420
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,940
where like a bunch of outdoor was

2421
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:53,400
shipped we had shitty brickweed growing

2422
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:55,138
up and then we had everything else yeah

2423
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:57,299
see I never saw a brick of weed till I

2424
01:31:55,139 --> 01:31:59,819
moved to California yeah see we had that

2425
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:01,980
growing up and that's all we had so like

2426
01:31:59,819 --> 01:32:05,219
you know trying to call Outdoor shitty

2427
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:09,000
compared to that is kind of hard

2428
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:10,500
yeah yeah I could see that I just I

2429
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:16,260
remember some of the outdoor beans so

2430
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:21,119
good but um so right before Y2K

2431
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:23,460
I got moved from Eugene Oregon uh down

2432
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:25,679
to Los Angeles I've been in a situation

2433
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:29,819
in Eugene where

2434
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:32,279
um my glass shop was in my house and I

2435
01:32:29,819 --> 01:32:33,658
had come home from I don't remember I

2436
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:35,939
might have been into girlfriends or out

2437
01:32:33,658 --> 01:32:38,519
hiking with my dogs but I pulled up to

2438
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:41,879
my house and there was three undercover

2439
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:45,600
cars and a bunch of cops in my house

2440
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:47,639
and I pulled up and I asked uh one of

2441
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,020
the officers I said what's going on this

2442
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:51,539
is my house

2443
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:54,659
and they tried to tell me that

2444
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:56,639
um they had chased a suspect he had

2445
01:32:54,658 --> 01:32:58,799
jumped over the fence and they thought

2446
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:02,400
he went into my house

2447
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,779
and so um I walked in my house they're

2448
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:07,379
all in my living room they're in my

2449
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:09,840
little glass shop and I'm like hey

2450
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:13,020
um so I'm assuming the guy is already

2451
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:14,639
here and uh they start asking me all

2452
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:17,340
sorts of questions like what's going in

2453
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:20,159
the glass shop you know uh what's all

2454
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:22,500
what are these gases for uh this isn't

2455
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:24,439
for cooking meth right and I'm like no

2456
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:26,279
no no I don't know anything about that

2457
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:29,158
and uh

2458
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:30,840
at the end they you know basically find

2459
01:33:29,158 --> 01:33:32,879
there's nothing there for them other

2460
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:35,460
than you know some glass pipes which a

2461
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,319
new Gene isn't a big deal and uh they

2462
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:40,198
leave and I call the police department

2463
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:42,119
and I start asking questions and they

2464
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:44,279
tell me that they never had any officers

2465
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:46,079
in my area that night

2466
01:33:44,279 --> 01:33:49,139
so the next day I go down to the Fifth

2467
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:51,719
Street Market and I talk to a lawyer

2468
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:53,699
that was always at The Hemp Fest

2469
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:56,399
you know and I ask him to look into it

2470
01:33:53,698 --> 01:34:00,658
and he makes some calls like I gave him

2471
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:02,158
like 200 retainer and uh he told me

2472
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:04,439
um

2473
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:06,539
at this point they're telling him that

2474
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:08,219
this never happened that I'm imagining

2475
01:34:06,539 --> 01:34:11,939
that they never had any officers in the

2476
01:34:08,219 --> 01:34:15,899
area and his personal recommendation to

2477
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:19,079
me would be to move somewhere else

2478
01:34:15,899 --> 01:34:21,179
you know wow I told him you know I I

2479
01:34:19,079 --> 01:34:22,679
don't really have too much illegal

2480
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:24,840
involvement other than the glass blowing

2481
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:26,579
and he just told me you know for my own

2482
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,020
safety maybe it'd be better if I did

2483
01:34:26,579 --> 01:34:30,238
move

2484
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:33,360
um I started talking to my distributor

2485
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:36,059
down in California and they offered to

2486
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:38,519
move me down there to start a glass

2487
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:41,940
blowing company wow they would give me

2488
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:43,260
the money and a place to live and set me

2489
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:45,119
up

2490
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:47,820
um the guy the guys that did that on a

2491
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:52,198
chain of stores in Los Angeles called uh

2492
01:34:47,819 --> 01:34:55,920
dementia and at the time they owned Roar

2493
01:34:52,198 --> 01:34:58,919
and later that became uh heavy glass and

2494
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:02,399
Sheldon black okay okay

2495
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:04,380
so they moved me down and uh the guy

2496
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:06,599
that is kind of coordinating all this is

2497
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:08,219
the manager for all the head shops and

2498
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,139
he's lived in the San Fernando Valley

2499
01:35:08,219 --> 01:35:12,960
his whole life he's real real connected

2500
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:14,819
yeah so um I was fortunate in that way

2501
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,500
because I was worried about coming down

2502
01:35:14,819 --> 01:35:18,840
to LA and not being able to get herb

2503
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:20,760
this is before they had stores you know

2504
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,619
yeah oh yeah

2505
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:25,079
so I moved down to LA

2506
01:35:22,619 --> 01:35:29,340
and the first thing he does is he

2507
01:35:25,079 --> 01:35:31,079
introduces me to a guy named Joel OG

2508
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:34,020
glass

2509
01:35:31,079 --> 01:35:36,658
who uh had grown up and Reseda so he was

2510
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:39,540
real uh connected too and he was

2511
01:35:36,658 --> 01:35:42,658
probably one of maybe 10 glassblowers

2512
01:35:39,539 --> 01:35:44,819
that were known down here okay and so

2513
01:35:42,658 --> 01:35:47,879
what was really cool about that was he

2514
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:51,779
was real connected with Oregon kid with

2515
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:55,319
Josh D with all these guys so within the

2516
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:57,539
first few months of me living in La I

2517
01:35:55,319 --> 01:36:00,658
was able to buy my first bag from Oregon

2518
01:35:57,539 --> 01:36:04,380
kid which was Bubba Kush for 450.

2519
01:36:00,658 --> 01:36:06,539
amazing oh yeah we hadn't I hadn't seen

2520
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:09,300
anything with that particular smell and

2521
01:36:06,539 --> 01:36:11,279
taste in Oregon and I was really

2522
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:13,500
expecting to come down to California and

2523
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:15,539
think especially Los Angeles and think

2524
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:18,238
they didn't have anything to offer me

2525
01:36:15,539 --> 01:36:20,639
yeah I had already lived in the Pinnacle

2526
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:22,198
of marijuana yeah for sure that was

2527
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:27,659
without knowing I had grown up in the

2528
01:36:22,198 --> 01:36:27,658
Pinnacle of berry marijuana yeah so

2529
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:33,000
um

2530
01:36:29,698 --> 01:36:36,059
few weeks maybe after that Bubba Kush I

2531
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,979
I uh got to go over to Josh D's house

2532
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:40,739
with Joel

2533
01:36:37,979 --> 01:36:43,638
handed over 500 bucks for my first mason

2534
01:36:40,738 --> 01:36:43,638
jar of OG

2535
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:48,658
with him I think at the time he was a

2536
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:50,579
photographer

2537
01:36:48,658 --> 01:36:52,379
and uh

2538
01:36:50,579 --> 01:36:54,300
it was one of the most amazing things

2539
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:55,800
I'd ever smelled I was just like holy

2540
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:58,320
[ __ ] now I definitely haven't ever

2541
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,840
smelled any weed like this before it had

2542
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:03,179
a golden color it wasn't like a dark

2543
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:06,060
green or anything it was like a nice

2544
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:10,500
cured brownish gold and it was just

2545
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:12,960
[ __ ] fantastic yeah I I have a hard

2546
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:15,779
time recalling ever seeing OG growing or

2547
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,819
looking and smelling that great as I did

2548
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:20,039
from Josh

2549
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:21,920
um that first month I also got

2550
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:24,600
introduced to a couple guys in Hollywood

2551
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,679
and that's where I first saw the

2552
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:28,620
tangerine

2553
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:30,420
and their big bud

2554
01:37:28,619 --> 01:37:34,619
um what they called

2555
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:37,859
the NorCal big bud was uh not like the

2556
01:37:34,619 --> 01:37:41,158
Amsterdam big bud this was like a pure

2557
01:37:37,859 --> 01:37:44,579
sweet skunk big bud how interesting it

2558
01:37:41,158 --> 01:37:46,500
was really nice the buds weren't big I I

2559
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:49,198
you know like they they weren't like

2560
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:51,719
huge colas like I'd expect there's

2561
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:54,359
another misnomer yielded huge she said

2562
01:37:51,719 --> 01:37:57,239
oh okay I gotcha that was the pull of

2563
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:59,880
that big butt but his Tangerine was

2564
01:37:57,238 --> 01:38:01,919
again one of the most unique things I'd

2565
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:04,500
ever smelled in weed what was that

2566
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,399
Tangerine like

2567
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,698
um

2568
01:38:05,399 --> 01:38:12,719
pure

2569
01:38:07,698 --> 01:38:14,939
pure Tangerine juice it's not what tangy

2570
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:18,000
it's Tangy has nothing to do with that

2571
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:22,138
tanji is gross in my opinion I think

2572
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:26,460
it's gross that tangerine

2573
01:38:22,139 --> 01:38:30,179
was gifted to Oregon kid okay right

2574
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:32,639
after my friend got busted and

2575
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:35,460
um we basically all closed down shop

2576
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:38,579
and didn't want to lose it it was it's

2577
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:39,899
my favorite weed I've ever had it's been

2578
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:43,319
that tangerine

2579
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:46,099
and uh he got it and changed the name to

2580
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:48,238
skunk tangerine

2581
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:50,820
skunk Tangerine I'm trying to think of

2582
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:52,859
what I have with that in it now you can

2583
01:38:50,819 --> 01:38:55,340
find it on um

2584
01:38:52,859 --> 01:39:00,019
certain

2585
01:38:55,340 --> 01:39:03,600
unreputable clone dealers menus I'm sure

2586
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:05,280
Oregon kids shared it with them with the

2587
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,920
promise that it wouldn't be let out

2588
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:11,880
which of course this guy who you've had

2589
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:15,980
running it running I'm sure now sells it

2590
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:19,920
but um it's a 12 to 13 week

2591
01:39:15,979 --> 01:39:23,399
sativa that doesn't get too tall but it

2592
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:26,940
yields great and it grows bats

2593
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:30,238
like just huge arm length colas of some

2594
01:39:26,939 --> 01:39:33,479
of the most smelliest beautiful fruit

2595
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:36,539
you know it puts Tangy to shame you know

2596
01:39:33,479 --> 01:39:38,698
yeah like I like a good orange I like a

2597
01:39:36,539 --> 01:39:41,519
good sweet orange myself like that

2598
01:39:38,698 --> 01:39:43,738
smells like sun-kissed orange juice like

2599
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,840
that I do not like Tangy because it's

2600
01:39:43,738 --> 01:39:50,099
never smelled like that to me it's like

2601
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:53,520
an orange rind or it's super muted yeah

2602
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:55,260
so it's almost like maybe a descendant

2603
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,440
or a bag seat from that original

2604
01:39:55,260 --> 01:40:00,840
Tangerine or something like that but

2605
01:39:58,439 --> 01:40:04,198
it's not the same I think I've seen Mean

2606
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:07,860
Gene comment about him seeing it before

2607
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:09,419
and it having huge bats but I know the

2608
01:40:07,859 --> 01:40:13,799
name was changed it was never skunk

2609
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:16,859
Tangerine when yeah at it you know

2610
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:18,900
as a little bit of a tangent but also

2611
01:40:16,859 --> 01:40:19,799
just to add some context

2612
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:23,759
um

2613
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:24,719
what do you like smoking these days

2614
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,060
um and I wonder if you could actually

2615
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:29,039
answer that for Hamlet as well if yet if

2616
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:34,159
you knew

2617
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:34,158
Hamlet loves Quimby

2618
01:40:34,738 --> 01:40:41,279
Quimby's an old Oregon strain

2619
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:42,658
you know what's in it no idea

2620
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:44,579
no idea

2621
01:40:42,658 --> 01:40:46,379
um when I lived in Eugene when the

2622
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:47,639
dentist yeah okay when the dead tour

2623
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,520
ended

2624
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:53,880
there was like an influx of people that

2625
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:56,699
left the the tour and moved to Eugene

2626
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:59,340
and Quimby came around that same time

2627
01:40:56,698 --> 01:41:02,638
that all those hippies and the heroine

2628
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:05,279
and all that stuff came to Eugene when

2629
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:06,840
the tour ended yeah you know there was

2630
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:08,399
positive the negatives when the tour

2631
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:09,779
ended

2632
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:12,000
you know

2633
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:14,519
um a lot more drugs but a lot of new

2634
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:18,119
strains Quimby was one of them

2635
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:19,560
and uh it was just real real unique

2636
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:20,760
I don't I don't know how else to

2637
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,320
describe it

2638
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,960
interesting

2639
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:28,619
um I know not so has experience with it

2640
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:30,500
yeah I think I think uh JD or one of

2641
01:41:28,619 --> 01:41:33,479
them used it or something

2642
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:35,039
okay there you go Whittaker Blues there

2643
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:37,678
you go that's why it's in my memory bank

2644
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:39,840
yeah absolutely

2645
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:44,100
um I haven't because I still smoke that

2646
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:47,760
today he doesn't yeah no that's oh wow

2647
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:49,619
okay it's not the pure Quimby something

2648
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,159
that was

2649
01:41:49,618 --> 01:41:54,960
um

2650
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:58,920
I think DJ had a Vanilla Kush any fan of

2651
01:41:54,960 --> 01:42:01,500
Luna okay so yeah a male from that was

2652
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:03,658
used to pollinate the coinbee okay and

2653
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:06,079
then Fino was found that's real real

2654
01:42:03,658 --> 01:42:08,939
close to that original

2655
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:11,760
fascinating that's as best as I can get

2656
01:42:08,939 --> 01:42:13,919
for you how about you yourself what do

2657
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:17,100
you like smoking these days

2658
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:20,579
I really like not so sour I was really

2659
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:21,600
surprised it didn't give me I I as I get

2660
01:42:20,579 --> 01:42:23,760
older

2661
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:26,100
my likelihood of having panic attacks

2662
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:28,079
smoking potent weed has gone through the

2663
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:31,739
roof yeah sure yeah there's certain

2664
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:33,420
things that um I joke about it but if I

2665
01:42:31,738 --> 01:42:36,118
smoke certain things I'm going to be in

2666
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:39,480
the bathtub with my wife assuring me

2667
01:42:36,118 --> 01:42:42,179
that I'm gonna be okay for an hour yeah

2668
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:46,678
dude just the reality of my situation

2669
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:48,960
now Jewish I wish more more uh males our

2670
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:50,579
age in our age group would talk about it

2671
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,579
because I think it's way more common

2672
01:42:50,579 --> 01:42:55,859
than anybody realizes to have these like

2673
01:42:53,579 --> 01:42:59,460
[ __ ] major panic attacks even like

2674
01:42:55,859 --> 01:43:02,460
because I dab all day long and I smoke

2675
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:04,380
flour interchangeably but there's times

2676
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:06,118
when flower will just set me off in a

2677
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:09,000
totally different direction and spin me

2678
01:43:06,118 --> 01:43:10,920
out and just give me a panic attack and

2679
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,479
I don't know it didn't happen when I was

2680
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:14,760
young but I don't know if hormonally as

2681
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:17,399
we get older some of us it like just

2682
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:19,139
affects us much get more different I I'm

2683
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:21,658
almost 100 more things to worry about

2684
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:24,060
it's hormonal yeah

2685
01:43:21,658 --> 01:43:26,939
things you worry about is adults too

2686
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:28,920
you know I I think it's hormonal yeah I

2687
01:43:26,939 --> 01:43:32,099
feel like there are some strains like if

2688
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:34,739
I am mad if I smoke Oracle I'm in the

2689
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:37,079
bathtub yeah same to me dude yeah

2690
01:43:34,738 --> 01:43:40,079
there's even if it's just a little bit

2691
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:43,019
I'll be in the bathtub yeah

2692
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:44,880
um not so sour uh definitely relaxed me

2693
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:47,580
made me feel a lot better

2694
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:51,719
um the pineapple fields from Dynasty has

2695
01:43:47,579 --> 01:43:53,460
a real nice put me in a happy place

2696
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:55,739
um

2697
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:57,300
effect for me I guess

2698
01:43:55,738 --> 01:43:58,919
um I got some Riot Berry I'm getting

2699
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,520
ready to try I'm hoping that that does

2700
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,899
it too because yeah me too

2701
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:06,360
make me feel real real good and I'm

2702
01:44:03,899 --> 01:44:09,059
hoping that I it's been so long since

2703
01:44:06,359 --> 01:44:11,279
I've had blueberry I'm hoping it can do

2704
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:13,560
the same for me again I hope because

2705
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:17,099
this mind descends from DJ's blue

2706
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:19,139
blueberry so I hoped that

2707
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:22,139
it just having the same scent expression

2708
01:44:19,139 --> 01:44:23,760
brings back some of those uh same I

2709
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:25,679
don't know however they combine out of

2710
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:28,079
the cannabinoids combine or you know

2711
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,600
whatever because I know that anything

2712
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:33,179
that typically has DJ's blueberry in it

2713
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:35,159
whether it's a hybrid or full whether

2714
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:36,960
it's blueberry scented or not usually

2715
01:44:35,158 --> 01:44:39,479
it's cool but usually if it has a

2716
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:42,480
blueberry scent it's it's totally

2717
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:43,859
anti-anxiety for me yeah so yeah it's

2718
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:45,299
weird it sounds like you have a very

2719
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:46,979
similar body chemistry or brain

2720
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:49,800
chemistry to me when it comes to strains

2721
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:51,238
it's it's weird it's ours you know some

2722
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,000
people look at me really weird when I

2723
01:44:51,238 --> 01:44:57,779
talk about it like [ __ ] you know but

2724
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:59,399
it's for real you know and I liked your

2725
01:44:57,779 --> 01:45:01,079
one suggestion I heard you say on one of

2726
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:02,759
the shows where you were like I just

2727
01:45:01,079 --> 01:45:04,380
smoked so much so that my tolerance

2728
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:06,780
doesn't get low enough to where it

2729
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:08,279
affects me that way as much yeah that's

2730
01:45:06,779 --> 01:45:10,079
the only thing I can do I had a little

2731
01:45:08,279 --> 01:45:12,779
more free time where I could experiment

2732
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:15,300
with that you know you know what really

2733
01:45:12,779 --> 01:45:17,759
helped me was with when I learned about

2734
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:19,320
like dabbing and [ __ ] because dabbing

2735
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,659
just doesn't hit me that way ever

2736
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:25,198
because it's just for me it's always the

2737
01:45:21,658 --> 01:45:27,779
same effect it's real boring but it it

2738
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:29,939
raised my tolerance for THC up so high

2739
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:32,399
that usually I don't get that but still

2740
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:34,979
even even you know dabbing diamonds all

2741
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:35,759
day it'll happen it'll happen and it's

2742
01:45:34,979 --> 01:45:38,099
not

2743
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:40,800
it's it's real weird I used to think it

2744
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:42,539
was all THC related but if I'm flooding

2745
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,239
myself with THC and it still happens

2746
01:45:42,539 --> 01:45:48,060
only with flour on odd occasions I I

2747
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:50,638
just don't know what causes it it sucks

2748
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:52,679
yeah and to be honest Urkel and Bubba

2749
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:54,779
are the two biggest and it's funny

2750
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:57,359
because I hear people say that [ __ ] is

2751
01:45:54,779 --> 01:45:59,759
not potent it doesn't get them high it

2752
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:02,039
has low highs and then if I smoke Urkel

2753
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:05,219
or bubble Bubba I'm running for the

2754
01:46:02,039 --> 01:46:06,899
hills yeah no and I don't know why I

2755
01:46:05,219 --> 01:46:08,819
don't think it's necessarily potent I

2756
01:46:06,899 --> 01:46:10,859
just think that it hits Us in such a

2757
01:46:08,819 --> 01:46:14,279
strange way and it's not not about

2758
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:16,439
potency it's just about what the [ __ ]

2759
01:46:14,279 --> 01:46:19,079
you know yeah

2760
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:22,859
the fear is there so

2761
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:24,719
yeah but I think um I'll definitely be

2762
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:26,039
getting to try a lot more things this

2763
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:28,079
year you know now that we're lucky

2764
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:29,639
enough to be able to have you know such

2765
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:31,519
great freedoms in California where we

2766
01:46:29,639 --> 01:46:33,500
can have six whole plants

2767
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:35,940
yeah I know right

2768
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:38,158
experiment with trying some some of the

2769
01:46:35,939 --> 01:46:39,979
new stuff some of the old stuff you know

2770
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:42,779
like right

2771
01:46:39,979 --> 01:46:44,759
what are you interested in

2772
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:46,679
uh for herb

2773
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:48,239
yeah like what what do you think you

2774
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:50,639
might be interested in in running that

2775
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:52,979
you haven't run before you know thousand

2776
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:56,219
what I'm most interested in and excited

2777
01:46:52,979 --> 01:46:56,218
for is

2778
01:46:56,279 --> 01:47:02,099
popping beans that are made by people

2779
01:46:58,738 --> 01:47:04,259
that I can feel good about supporting

2780
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:07,320
um hell yeah I think there's enough

2781
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:12,420
people in this industry at this point

2782
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:14,698
that can get lucky or pick a male to

2783
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:17,340
pollinate a bunch of clones with that

2784
01:47:14,698 --> 01:47:19,019
there's a ton of good seeds and like at

2785
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:21,420
this point it'd probably be hard to find

2786
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:24,600
Bad Seeds unless you're buying from one

2787
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:29,060
of the big companies I do get excited

2788
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:31,440
about is being able to

2789
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:35,880
participate in people that

2790
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:38,819
I really know have a valid story and a

2791
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:42,960
valid love of the plan and our breeding

2792
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:46,859
for specific reasons you know like I

2793
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:49,859
love Trace dog so I'm gonna cross it

2794
01:47:46,859 --> 01:47:52,920
with this other thing that I really love

2795
01:47:49,859 --> 01:47:55,500
and hopefully it passes on this instead

2796
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:58,079
of just guys that say

2797
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:00,899
um I've got grape gas I'm just going to

2798
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:03,779
S1 it onto every single cookie stable

2799
01:48:00,899 --> 01:48:05,819
yeah you know and I'm sure all those

2800
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:08,340
things they could have marvelous plants

2801
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:10,259
in them yeah but I want to support guys

2802
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:12,119
that are breeding

2803
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:14,940
and on a mission

2804
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:16,618
you know and kind of be able to follow

2805
01:48:14,939 --> 01:48:19,019
those

2806
01:48:16,618 --> 01:48:20,759
I don't know if I'd call them stories or

2807
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:23,280
not but I want to follow their

2808
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:25,199
theoretical ideas and see if they match

2809
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:27,899
up and see if I can experience those

2810
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:31,019
same things that they experience yeah

2811
01:48:27,899 --> 01:48:33,599
you know yeah I I think I

2812
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:36,119
go ahead I think I just think that like

2813
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,699
one important aspect of this is

2814
01:48:36,118 --> 01:48:41,158
connection and feeling like in growing

2815
01:48:38,698 --> 01:48:44,279
someone's work you are connected to

2816
01:48:41,158 --> 01:48:47,879
them their projects you know

2817
01:48:44,279 --> 01:48:49,579
um a wider Community my aspect

2818
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:53,219
that's right

2819
01:48:49,579 --> 01:48:54,600
I got you with an aspect

2820
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:55,859
you know I think that's one of the

2821
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,179
really cool things it's one of the

2822
01:48:55,859 --> 01:48:59,519
really cool things about breeder

2823
01:48:57,179 --> 01:49:00,539
syndicate is

2824
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,820
um

2825
01:49:00,539 --> 01:49:03,840
I can feel really good about throwing my

2826
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:05,759
support

2827
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,400
towards certain people

2828
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:11,159
you know because uh

2829
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,420
like back in the day Gypsy Nirvana I

2830
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:14,399
don't want to throw my money at guys

2831
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:17,819

01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:35,759

2841
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:42,059
don't want to support guys that jet set

2842
01:49:39,719 --> 01:49:45,840

2844
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:49,139
I know back in Oregon the people that

2845
01:49:47,819 --> 01:49:51,000
actually know them know they've never

2846
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:52,920
grown any [ __ ] places you can touch

2847
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,079
the plants ever yeah it's very common

2848
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:56,639

choices yeah

2857
01:50:14,579 --> 01:50:19,859
yeah because this is my experience of a

2858
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,500
lot of the industry especially before I

2859
01:50:19,859 --> 01:50:23,819
came to the breed of Syndicate like

2860
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:28,618
everything's really like

2861
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:32,099
uh faceless lifeless soulless uh

2862
01:50:28,618 --> 01:50:34,920
alienated isolated it's just like

2863
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:37,320
um nothing seemed nothing felt real

2864
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:39,179
um until I found you know some of some

2865
01:50:37,319 --> 01:50:42,359
of these guys here

2866
01:50:39,179 --> 01:50:44,219
yeah you know like I want to be excited

2867
01:50:42,359 --> 01:50:45,719
about genuine people that care about the

2868
01:50:44,219 --> 01:50:48,060
things that I care about

2869
01:50:45,719 --> 01:50:49,260
okay even if my garden is only six

2870
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:51,300
plants

2871
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:52,500
it's what brings me happiness at the end

2872
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:55,079
of the day

2873
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:56,939
you know it's it's not a freedom it's

2874
01:50:55,079 --> 01:51:00,179
just what they're allowing us basically

2875
01:50:56,939 --> 01:51:01,859
yeah but it's what brings me back to a

2876
01:51:00,179 --> 01:51:04,319
time in my life when I was super free

2877
01:51:01,859 --> 01:51:06,779
and I was

2878
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:08,698
more concerned with myself yeah right

2879
01:51:06,779 --> 01:51:11,519
and more concerned with just happiness

2880
01:51:08,698 --> 01:51:15,118
yeah you know so if I can get in with

2884
01:51:19,979 --> 01:51:23,218
experience and what their favorite

2885
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:25,020

2887
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:29,580
life and we can share it with each other

rip it up like of all the photographers

2926
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:58,980
sub cool was just he was one of the best

2927
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:00,600
when it came to taking pictures of

2928
01:52:58,979 --> 01:53:03,178
beautiful plants that no no one did it

2929
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:05,159
better but I remember Dynasty got on his

2930

2933
01:53:10,139 --> 01:53:13,980
yeah dude he's made a good name for

2934
01:53:12,359 --> 01:53:17,158
himself he's been around a long time and

2935
01:53:13,979 --> 01:53:19,079
he's kept his his strains unique and uh

2936
01:53:17,158 --> 01:53:20,638
his own identity and I appreciate that a

2937
01:53:19,079 --> 01:53:22,920
lot he's cool

2938
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:25,380
and you know what Matt out of everything

2939
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:27,840
I popped from him it's look like those

2940
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:29,219
pictures yeah yeah that's and that's

2941
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:32,100
another thing that's important right

2942
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:34,380
like that you know you're getting what

2943
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:37,079
he tells you you're gonna get absolutely

2944
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:39,239
and that's that's a part of the art of

2945
01:53:37,079 --> 01:53:40,920
it I would say you know like when you

2946
01:53:39,238 --> 01:53:43,678
can deliver on something and say this

2947
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:45,840
this thing that I haven't bought myself

2948
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:47,579
I have I've worked with this enough that

2949
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,679
I can predict how this is gonna the

2950
01:53:47,579 --> 01:53:51,059
outcome of this and it and I can show

2951
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:52,139
you these pictures but I can ensure you

2952
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:53,880
it's going to look like this that's

2953
01:53:52,139 --> 01:53:55,679
something special and a lot of that's

2954
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:59,159
been missing for a long time

2955
01:53:55,679 --> 01:54:01,618
especially when it's not just uh you

2956
01:53:59,158 --> 01:54:03,479
know cushman's by whatever clone yeah

2957
01:54:01,618 --> 01:54:04,679
you're a big seed breeder but yeah

2958
01:54:03,479 --> 01:54:08,819
you're gonna know it's gonna look like

2959
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:12,179
cushman's you know yeah yeah you know I

2960
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:14,399
I like that unique stuff I I was doing

2961
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:16,319
like I was I've been you know like doing

2962
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:18,059
strain reviews lately and like looking

2963
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:19,799
at the new strains because I don't know

2964
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:22,080
[ __ ] about any strains and I probably

2965
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:23,279
should because of the show so I was

2966
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:25,559
looking up these different ones like

2967
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:27,118
Blue Sushi and stuff and I didn't

2968
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:29,460
realize this because because of their

2969
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:31,139
names and obviously I should be

2970
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:33,420
if you shouldn't shock me or anything

2971
01:54:31,139 --> 01:54:35,400
but there is no blueberry in it and

2972
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:38,158
there's no there's nothing called Sushi

2973
01:54:35,399 --> 01:54:41,039
it was like a cushman's skittles yeah it

2974
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:43,019
was a cushman's right like what like

2975
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:44,519
what that Cushman Skittles has been done

2976
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:45,900
for years you're they're still pushing

2977
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,639

01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:05,880
it was funny is that um there's a dude

2984
01:55:04,139 --> 01:55:07,440
named dirt farmer genetics that had just

2985

not even his release I don't I think I

2989
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:16,500
know who made that but I don't want to

2990
01:55:15,479 --> 01:55:18,059
say because they probably don't want

2991
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,779
people to know they made it for him so

2992
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:21,239

3020
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:33,718
um it's just a fascinating part of the

3021
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,100
OG story you know and it's always

3022
01:56:33,719 --> 01:56:37,020
interesting when people meet him early

3023
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:37,980
on and have their Impressions and all

3024
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:40,739

3025
01:56:37,979 --> 01:56:43,979
you know he he was a real sweet he well

3026
01:56:40,738 --> 01:56:45,779
no he still is yeah Thane was he hasn't

3027
01:56:43,979 --> 01:56:47,759
changed he's a sweet guy yeah he's

3028
01:56:45,779 --> 01:56:50,460
through a lot he's one of those guys

3029
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:53,400
that was real early on yeah

3030
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:54,359
um and in my eyes got taken advantage of

3031
01:56:53,399 --> 01:56:58,138
like crazy

3032
01:56:54,359 --> 01:57:01,019
yeah you know like he uh he had some

3033
01:56:58,139 --> 01:57:03,600
physical limitations but he should still

3034
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:05,580
he's pretty talented with cannabis yeah

3035
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:08,579
he is I don't know if you know this but

3036
01:57:05,579 --> 01:57:11,819
he's bred some really cool [ __ ] yeah oh

3037
01:57:08,579 --> 01:57:13,859
and he should still be you know in

3038
01:57:11,819 --> 01:57:16,380
everybody's mouth like doing cool [ __ ]

3039
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:18,899
like a lot of these guys do and he's not

3040
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:20,819
for whatever reason and I don't know if

3041
01:57:18,899 --> 01:57:22,439
that's personal choices he's made or

3042
01:57:20,819 --> 01:57:24,899
just the fact that

3043
01:57:22,439 --> 01:57:26,698
people are going to take advantage of

3044
01:57:24,899 --> 01:57:29,460
you if you put yourself in situations to

3045
01:57:26,698 --> 01:57:31,799
get taken advantage of take advantage I

3046
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:34,139
I've attributed most of my like early

3047
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:36,060
career to him and and kept him going

3048
01:57:34,139 --> 01:57:38,520
like that because I thought like because

3049
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:40,020
I I did so much with the banana OG like

3050
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:42,599
he was such an important part of what

3051
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:44,639
people attributed to me and um even

3052
01:57:42,599 --> 01:57:47,819
Bubba because he played such a major

3053
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:49,199
part with that you know and um yeah I

3054
01:57:47,819 --> 01:57:51,059
think he deserves a lot more credit than

3055
01:57:49,198 --> 01:57:52,618
he gets too and it's a shame because he

3056
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:54,960
was an important part of all that for a

3057
01:57:52,618 --> 01:57:57,719
lot of us a lot of us and banana OG is

3058
01:57:54,960 --> 01:58:00,658
still being used out the wazoo could you

3059
01:57:57,719 --> 01:58:03,420
imagine if he hadn't paid that money for

3060
01:58:00,658 --> 01:58:05,460
the OG Kush clone from Josh what would

3061
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:07,618
have happened with OG Kush I can't

3062
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:09,319
imagine yeah it would have been locked

3063
01:58:07,618 --> 01:58:13,019
down so much further for longer

3064
01:58:09,319 --> 01:58:15,000
absolutely yeah you know like that thing

3065
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:16,860
was hard to get he made that accessible

3066
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,479
for everybody we should all be thankful

3067
01:58:16,859 --> 01:58:21,179
just like

3068
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:23,519
um the chems yeah

3069
01:58:21,179 --> 01:58:25,319
yeah exactly they were made accessible

3070
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:27,719
forever but they were and we were

3071
01:58:25,319 --> 01:58:29,099
fortunate to have them yeah yeah we are

3072
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:30,840
we are

3073
01:58:29,099 --> 01:58:33,119
whether we like the guys that had them

3074
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:35,340
or not exactly that doesn't quite matter

3075
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:37,319
you know it doesn't matter the fact that

3076
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:39,480
they're still available in uh

3077
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:42,479
yeah even that Bubba Kush bro that thing

3078
01:58:39,479 --> 01:58:45,059
was [ __ ] amazing real amazing yeah

3079
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:46,799
when he had it you know I never got the

3080
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:48,179
coffee stuff from it mine was always

3081
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,880
more lime

3082
01:58:48,179 --> 01:58:52,859
but it was beautiful there's a lot of

3083
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:55,020
different ways you can grow Bubba and

3084
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:57,299
it's one of those plants where like I I

3085
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:59,760
can get it earthy coffee I can get it

3086
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:02,340
almost chocolatey I can get it soapy

3087
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:04,079
cushy you know you can get lime out of

3088
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:06,539
it definitely you know

3089
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:08,819
um there's a lot in Bubba depending on

3090
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:11,099
how you grow it and the s1s there's a

3091
01:59:08,819 --> 01:59:14,039
lot of variation too there's there's all

3092
01:59:11,099 --> 01:59:15,719
lemon Finos in the s1s that show up yeah

3093
01:59:14,039 --> 01:59:18,979
I'm looking forward to someday popping

3094
01:59:15,719 --> 01:59:23,179
about it yeah I think I think CSI just

3095
01:59:18,979 --> 01:59:25,079
CSI just popped in another 100 or two

3096
01:59:23,179 --> 01:59:26,219
just to run through them to see what's

3097
01:59:25,079 --> 01:59:29,519
in there again

3098
01:59:26,219 --> 01:59:30,840
yeah yeah CSI

3099
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:33,739
yeah

3100
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:36,000
I wish I had that much space man

3101
01:59:33,738 --> 01:59:38,698
you know these guys are living our Dream

3102
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,198
yeah he really is you know every once

3103
01:59:38,698 --> 01:59:41,638
while I'll get hit up you know by a

3104
01:59:40,198 --> 01:59:44,219
younger guy and they're just like oh bro

3105
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:45,960
the glass thing is so awesome you know

3106
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:50,000
and it's like uh

3107
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:53,219
I got in the glass because I loved weed

3108
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:55,198
roller coaster so that I can continue on

3109
01:59:53,219 --> 01:59:58,079
into weed you know because I've never

3110
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:59,879
been great at being social yeah so I I

3111
01:59:58,079 --> 02:00:03,059
could do the glass blowing and get in

3112
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:05,760
the circles I wanted to you know and it

3113
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:08,340
turned out for me but I'd rather live uh

3114
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,920
Caleb's dream than this dream you know

3115
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:12,960
yeah I you know like I'm so fascinated

3116
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:14,819
by different art like and I've done the

3117
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:16,980
seed stuff for so long I'd be more into

3118
02:00:14,819 --> 02:00:20,158
the glass thing now I'd be like wow just

3119
02:00:16,979 --> 02:00:21,339
to learn a whole new trade as opposed to

3120
02:00:20,158 --> 02:00:22,618
more seeds

3121
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:26,159
[Music]

3122
02:00:22,618 --> 02:00:28,079
more seeds but then again if I if I was

3123
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:29,519
doing it at a csi's level it'd be a

3124
02:00:28,079 --> 02:00:32,099
different story though because like that

3125
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:35,340
much space you can really really have

3126
02:00:32,099 --> 02:00:36,779
options run through some fantasies yeah

3127
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:39,840
dude to be able to see things in that

3128
02:00:36,779 --> 02:00:41,939
large of populations always and and I

3129
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:44,819
shouldn't say to be able to he has been

3130
02:00:41,939 --> 02:00:47,339
out of all out of everyone he's been the

3131
02:00:44,819 --> 02:00:50,639
most inclusive of anyone in in those big

3132
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:52,380
projects with me like it's it's

3133
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:53,699
I just don't take it for granted it's

3134
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:56,219
one of those things where like a mentor

3135
02:00:53,698 --> 02:00:58,618
is showing you like how it's done like

3136
02:00:56,219 --> 02:01:00,239
it's crazy to be able to see that and to

3137
02:00:58,618 --> 02:01:01,559
get insight into each one of those and

3138
02:01:00,238 --> 02:01:03,839
then he spends time with that it's

3139
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:06,239
really cool though and it really works

3140
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,920
hard yeah I hope we'll be able to share

3141
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:10,079
it again soon on the on the Bubba stuff

3142
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:13,139
if he does another episode here soon so

3143
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:15,539
yeah when Matt jeez we need to start

3144
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:20,039
beating on his door hey dude everyone

3145
02:01:15,539 --> 02:01:20,039
yeah yeah everything

3146
02:01:20,698 --> 02:01:23,279
um

3147
02:01:21,479 --> 02:01:25,079
I just want to say that this has been

3148
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:27,779
such a cool conversation like we got

3149
02:01:25,079 --> 02:01:30,059
such a such a neat overview as well on

3150
02:01:27,779 --> 02:01:33,238
like the glass scene yeah you know from

3151
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:36,000
like Bob Snodgrass Eugene operation pipe

3152
02:01:33,238 --> 02:01:38,039
dreams science glass

3153
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,460
um Import Glass like we basically got

3154
02:01:38,039 --> 02:01:43,738
all these lovely Milestones from YouTube

3155
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:46,139
um and I think anyone from anywhere

3156
02:01:43,738 --> 02:01:49,079
wanting to learn about at least you know

3157
02:01:46,139 --> 02:01:51,239
uh get an idea of the history of of

3158
02:01:49,079 --> 02:01:53,460
glass pipes like this has been such a

3159
02:01:51,238 --> 02:01:55,439
great conversation

3160
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:57,060
um yeah

3161
02:01:55,439 --> 02:01:59,399
yeah I think we could probably take it

3162
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:01,260
you know if you ever wanted to because

3163
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:03,238
we barely touched on each one of those

3164
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:04,560
things in in brief segments so if

3165
02:02:03,238 --> 02:02:06,059
there's anything you want to expand on

3166
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:08,639
and if anybody has any questions about

3167
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:10,440
anything they heard in this episode let

3168
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:12,599
us know give us feedback and we'd love

3169
02:02:10,439 --> 02:02:14,698
to have them back it's been a really fun

3170
02:02:12,599 --> 02:02:16,319
one and I mean I just sat here and

3171
02:02:14,698 --> 02:02:18,299
learned I kind of stayed shut up those

3172
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:20,219
people were just like you know because

3173
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:22,679
this is yeah informative for me I love

3174
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:25,800
it I suspect that this is not the last

3175
02:02:22,679 --> 02:02:29,460
time we will see uh Michael AKA spindle

3176
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:32,219
yeah hopefully not

3177
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:34,260
yeah any anytime there's anything you

3178
02:02:32,219 --> 02:02:35,579
guys want to ask feel free if there's

3179
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:37,380
anything you feel like I didn't cover

3180
02:02:35,579 --> 02:02:39,118
well enough and you have more questions

3181
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:40,920
a thousand please

3182
02:02:39,118 --> 02:02:43,158
I don't know if I covered covered this

3183
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:46,739
well enough uh this is some of the glass

3184
02:02:43,158 --> 02:02:49,859
yeah and realistically like

3185
02:02:46,738 --> 02:02:52,618
when we we met up and I tried it like no

3186
02:02:49,859 --> 02:02:54,479
[ __ ] these became my only pieces not

3187
02:02:52,618 --> 02:02:56,819
because like this had this thing even

3188
02:02:54,479 --> 02:02:58,919
been talked about or exist became my my

3189
02:02:56,819 --> 02:03:00,238
favorite pieces because of function and

3190
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:01,380
that's why we even started talking and

3191
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:03,479
you started talking to me because you

3192
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:05,599
love [ __ ] strains and weed and we

3193
02:03:03,479 --> 02:03:07,979
just kind of dorked out together and

3194
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:09,539
it's been really amazing and like I said

3195
02:03:07,979 --> 02:03:11,339
there's only a few times in life when

3196
02:03:09,539 --> 02:03:13,618
you get leveled up on on something that

3197
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:16,020
you love and I felt like I got leveled

3198
02:03:13,618 --> 02:03:18,059
up in in smoking functionality with you

3199
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:19,619
guys and and I appreciate that so thank

3200
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:22,739
you very much

3201
02:03:19,618 --> 02:03:25,979
quickest from point A to B that's right

3202
02:03:22,738 --> 02:03:30,439
man it's all it takes you avoid veering

3203
02:03:25,979 --> 02:03:30,439
off into that [ __ ] sea yeah

3204
02:03:30,539 --> 02:03:33,260
you know

3205
02:03:33,719 --> 02:03:37,079
so

3206
02:03:35,099 --> 02:03:39,480
um I think if if you're trying to wrap

3207
02:03:37,079 --> 02:03:41,219
it up thousand there's a couple things I

3208
02:03:39,479 --> 02:03:43,559
wanted to go over for anybody that might

3209
02:03:41,219 --> 02:03:47,520
be younger in the audience I know how to

3210
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:50,880
do it have some years ago number one

3211
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:53,820
um do not this older generation of seed

3212
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:57,000
makers these guys in their late 30s to

3213
02:03:53,819 --> 02:04:00,299
40s to 50s don't build them up into

3214
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,500
something they're not they're just guys

3215
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:04,980
don't

3216
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:06,840
follow people blindly and fight for them

3217
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:09,658
if you don't know what they're about

3218
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:12,719
they're just guys making seeds enjoy

3219
02:04:09,658 --> 02:04:14,098
what they do enjoy their seeds but don't

3220
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:17,039
build people up because they're going to

3221
02:04:14,099 --> 02:04:19,139
be constantly constantly torn down it's

3222
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:20,219
going to bum you out yeah

3223
02:04:19,139 --> 02:04:21,420
um

3224
02:04:20,219 --> 02:04:24,239
two

3225
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:27,179
glass bowling is one of the last

3226
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:30,059
American handmade

3227
02:04:27,179 --> 02:04:31,380
Industries you know there's not a lot of

3228
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:34,440
things that you can buy in America

3229
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:36,840
anymore that is made by Americans and

3230
02:04:34,439 --> 02:04:40,259
glass is one of them it doesn't have to

3231
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:42,960
be C2 support American Glass there's not

3232
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:45,539
a big enough price difference to throw

3233
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:48,179
your money at some Sweatshop that's not

3234
02:04:45,539 --> 02:04:50,819
taking care of its people yeah

3235
02:04:48,179 --> 02:04:53,699
and uh three for the younger generation

3236
02:04:50,819 --> 02:04:55,439
I know a lot of people are hurting

3237
02:04:53,698 --> 02:04:56,879
they're not going to have money to

3238
02:04:55,439 --> 02:05:00,539
travel around the world I was very

3239
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:03,000
fortunate young I got to go to Europe

3240
02:05:00,539 --> 02:05:05,340
um there's a thing I found in France

3241
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,479
called a bidet

3242
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:08,480
younger generation

3243
02:05:08,698 --> 02:05:13,678
it's not that it's not manly

3244
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:15,779
spray water on your ass it's the fact

3245
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:16,739
that no one wants to shake hands with

3246
02:05:15,779 --> 02:05:20,158
someone

3247
02:05:16,738 --> 02:05:22,019
whose ass was only a small hand was only

3248
02:05:20,158 --> 02:05:25,738
a small tissue

3249
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:29,599
between [ __ ] and your handshake yes

3250
02:05:25,738 --> 02:05:29,598
thank you get yourself a bidet

3251
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:38,520
and smeared [ __ ] on your arm

3252
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:40,500
would you be comfortable using a handful

3253
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:43,139
of paper towels and just wiping that

3254
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:45,719
clean and then going about your business

3255
02:05:43,139 --> 02:05:47,520
I don't think you've ever never

3256
02:05:45,719 --> 02:05:49,500
I don't think I've been lucky enough to

3257
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,900
go to Japan a couple of times and I

3258
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:54,479
gotta say I do love the bidet now yeah

3259
02:05:51,899 --> 02:05:56,579
absolutely it's a small upgrade for your

3260
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:59,000
house you don't have to eat it's like 30

3261
02:05:56,579 --> 02:06:01,559
bucks 30 bucks on Amazon

3262
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,719
you'll be clean the rest of your life do

3263
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:06,539

pandemic yes see something [ __ ] related

3265
02:06:06,539 --> 02:06:10,920
it could be and it could be because

3266
02:06:08,219 --> 02:06:12,658
you're not using bidets absolutely and

3267
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:15,779

3268
02:06:12,658 --> 02:06:18,299
when you walk around absolutely you want

3269

doing this anyway so we're not

3321
02:08:24,779 --> 02:08:29,819
I I think it's the greatest deal in the

3322
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:31,859
industry you get to really get details

3323
02:08:29,819 --> 02:08:34,019
about the seeds you're buying from

3324
02:08:31,859 --> 02:08:35,519
people that bred them and grew them out

3325
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:38,300
and tested them

3326
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:41,280
you can get a 40 discount on

3327

American-made glass that's right you

3328
02:08:41,279 --> 02:08:45,539
know and you get to basically commune

3329
02:08:44,039 --> 02:08:49,920
with a bunch of people that have the

3330
02:08:45,539 --> 02:08:51,599
same exact interest as you yeah so and

3331
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:53,340
there's not there's not trolls like we

3332
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:56,219
don't it's it's a really weird Community

3333
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:57,779
it's not like Instagram or Twitter or

3334
02:08:56,219 --> 02:08:59,279
just people sniping at each other it

3335
02:08:57,779 --> 02:09:01,800
