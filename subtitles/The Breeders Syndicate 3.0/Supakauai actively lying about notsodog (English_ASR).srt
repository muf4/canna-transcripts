1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,318
man I like it though I like I like the

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,419
the the

3
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:08,219
provenance Dives

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:11,339
um speaking of which dragonfly is asking

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,620
about the HP 13 what's that one again

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,539
so that's the hash plant 13 that's

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,059
prominent on Maui

8
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,278
um I'm not gonna say any specific names

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,679
but we'd love to hear anything about it

10
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,960
he says he just so this is this is the

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,059
cut is still held down within Hawaii I

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,800
could get access to breed with it but

13
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,439
Grace called the grower a well-known

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,359
person he got stuck up on Maui because

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,640
he didn't follow the instructions on

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,140
what they wanted him to do with the HP

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,140
13 and um

18
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:47,519
is an actual Mainland bagseed variety

19
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:51,299
found on Maui that people still grow and

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,160
love but the dog was pre that that

21
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,378
was from like the 70s 80s it's basically

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,500
like a licorice gas variety right so

23
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:03,420
like Grace called the grower had the dog

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,400
Maui dog and hb13 and you know I told

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,900
him before we're still friends to this

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,159
day I told him that dude those are Cuts

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,080
you don't want to around with you

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,460
have those and they catch you breeding

29
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,539
with those things like they'll pull up

30
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:17,099
on you and so like he got pulled up on

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,600
you know what I mean like not a lot of

32
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,280
people know that story but like it's

33
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,199
kind of a bad look in my opinion for

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,420
Hawaii with the Wii game doing that kind

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,118
of but you have a lot of proud guys

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,799
that like it is what it is and it's like

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,379
I'll explain it like this like I know

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,240
guys on Big Island right

39
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,578
um not so dog I believe the guy's name

40
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,679
is who he doesn't mean me and him don't

41
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,959
really like each other right but him and

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,479
CSI are friends

43
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,819
um Caleb and he told me he bought

44
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,859
hundreds of or not thousands about

45
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,478
thousands of dollars worth of um purple

46
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,578
Orca work

47
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,500
um from Caleb CSI and he couldn't ever

48
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,298
find anything like the original right

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,719
and then he me and him were talking

50
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,360
right okay

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,920
no I know mind no I I know but just

52
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,259
listen this is all truth right here

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
right like I happen to believe it or not

54
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,419
small enough world my best friend

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,939
growing up is bad his brother is the

56
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,318
original farm for portfols out of

57
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,780
right

58
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,479
so anyways

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,459
if you look into it me and this guy were

60
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,280
talking stories we did a couple podcasts

61
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,020
back in 2018 or 19 talking about Hawaii

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,020
strains

63
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,580
and we he basically was trying to set me

64
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,439
up because he wanted to get the Cherry

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,319
Pie cut that I had that he knows for

66
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,780
Urkle Dominic right because he tried

67
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,759
some of my flour on Big Island he

68
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,818
already knew what time it was you know

69
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,799
what I mean and so right there I tell

70
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:46,259
him look I don't want to trade for this

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,760
and that I want HP 13 and I want the dog

72
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,378
and I'm going to breed with it I need

73
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,500
permission to do so

74
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:54,060
you feel me yeah like I'm considered a

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,800
white boy Holly out here in Hawaii but

76
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,180
I'm born and raised so it's like on my

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,500
Island ain't nobody can tell me

78
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,159
because they already know I earned I

79
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,959
paid the dues to be respected and

80
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,280
basically he didn't want to make that

81
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,019
agreement he didn't want to make that

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,098
trade right so then I called him on it I

83
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,480
was like you should breed with it then

84
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,878
and release that seeds to the world

85
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,139
right turns out I went and talked to the

86
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:14,759
people that are actually well connected

87
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,559
they're not even supposed to have those

88
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,000
cuts and that's why the cat really seeds

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,500
of it like they're not going to get

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
rolled up on and have them taken from

91
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,719
them but that's why the seeds aren't out

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,700
there's just people that don't want it

93
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,280
out there and I know them but like they

94
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,658
don't want me to do it either

95
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,439
well you know that's something that I do

96
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,459
see

97
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,959
um I

98
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,000
can't comment on the you know

99
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,800
interbreeder stuff but you're right when

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,139
it comes to Hawaii there are a lot of

101
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,879
people who are proud of the cultivars

102
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,899
they have and they're not willing to let

103
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,818
them go it's something that I've

104
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,400
definitely observed and then the final

105
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,738
point I want to make on this is if you

106
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,799
look into it CSI is now trying to

107
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,860
acquire a cut of cherry pie from dungeon

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,599
vaults genetics right and I'm I know all

109
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,879
of this is happening this way because

110
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,098
we're been dominating that purple Cherry

111
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,079
line for a long ass time I know mad

112
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:05,939
Farmer's killing it too but I'm saying

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,799
some of these other guys some of these

114
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,759
other guys that be saying they got this

115
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,519
and that

116
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,620
it's all about the leaf um serration if

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,239
it doesn't have the double serration on

118
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,519
it and the right Darkness to the color

119
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,680
where the Leaf's almost like a blue to

120
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,918
it it's not the real thing

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,660
well uh listen man we I'm I'm a big fan

122
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,279
of what you're putting out I definitely

123
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,500
don't want to get in the middle of uh

124
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,758
you know the the breeder conflicts no

125
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm not bringing I'm not your

126
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,180
perspective I'm not bringing any drama

127
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm telling you facts everything I just

128
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,959
stated right there is actual true

129
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,060
information I got you it's just not

130
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,279
publicly aired because I get deleted off

131
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,839
of every platform that I'm on and most

132
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,059
people who speak the truth what happens

133
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,478
I did notice that you'd lost your

134
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,780
Instagram again but um that's a

135
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,779
different person
