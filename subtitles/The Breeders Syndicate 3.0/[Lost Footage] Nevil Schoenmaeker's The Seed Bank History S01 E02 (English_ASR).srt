I think we are live I'm trying to get

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,740

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,298

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,719
what we're talking about during

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:17,719

8
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,719
so how's everyone doing tonight see I

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,100

um

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,840
let's see how many people we got only

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,339
yeah we got quite a few people

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,640
registered let's see how many people pop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,640
on

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,199
I can see the registrations I can't see

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,719
how many people are in here live

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,899
so if you guys can feel free to shout it

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,899
out

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,739
yeah maybe I'll give them a few minutes

20
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,839
I'll give everyone a few minutes since

21
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,279
it's a different kind of process than

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,780
Instagram people got to go check their

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,780
email to get the link and all that crap

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,819
naza's on the way

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,180
so yeah this is uh we're gonna talk

26
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,459
about the history of of cannabis e banks

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,260
as we know them right

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,780
um a lot of people are familiar with

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,060
seed banks as far as the attitude uh

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,219
more modern type seed banks but this

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,820
goes this is a an industry that goes

32
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,079
back a long way and uh yeah so that's

33
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,758
what we're going to be going over I'm

34
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,920
going to try to do most of the

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,140
illustrating from my end like the old

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,240
seed bank catalogs

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,500
um and not so is going to try to handle

38
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,298
most of the

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,259
the talking because I mean this is his

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,259
specialty right

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,280
let's see if there's any questions I can

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,859
answer real quick

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,060
any chance you could get CSI on I think

44
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,118
it would make one of the best podcasts

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,600
in Canada's history actually sent uh a

46
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,519
picture of that that comment to CSI so

47
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,500
so he can see it himself

48
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,359
uh let's see what else we got anything

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,700
else I can answer

50
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,399
hash plant to Neville

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,539
um I'm sure uh

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,539
not so remember that

53
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,520
it will be available to watch for a

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,279
short period of time if you missed the

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,200
live event hopefully we can record it

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,818

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
creating my own for a couple years

76
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,340
Crossing hemp High CBD varieties with

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
canvas strains from my own personal use

78
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,200
is this a thing yes it's absolutely a

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,200
thing

80
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,139
yeah man I I came into it when um forums

81
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,140
were the source of knowledge and my God

82
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:19,799
my God how much has changed you know

83
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:22,979
there he is we are here how you doing

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,840
bud I'm good it finally worked sorry

85
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,579
sorry everyone for the technical

86
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,640
difficulties but it appears that I can

87
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,340
see my face can everybody hear me yeah I

88
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,079
think so can you guys hear them

89
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,098
fantastic

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,840
I can see your hands Matt yeah I I um I

91
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:41,459
mounted this so I can I can illustrate

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,900
as you talk through certain things you

93
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,378
know with the Seedbank catalogs the

94
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,599
Scentsy catalogs sssc we got here we got

95
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:51,000
even the original sacred packs as you

96
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,500
talk about any of it so let's just start

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,259
rolling man

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,259
all right so uh this is the first

99
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,639
edition of our new thing so obviously

100
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:01,378
like we've never done this before

101
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,419
hopefully it works a little smoother

102
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,878
than live

103
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,679
um and uh we'll be able to do a couple

104
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,280
more cooler things we should be able to

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,459
see people's questions yeah uh all that

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,220
so uh hopefully bear with us with some

107
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,079
technical difficulties if they occur but

108
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,940
hopefully we'll be able to chat a bunch

109
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,319
of a bunch of cool [ __ ] and it'll work a

110
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,418
little easier we'll be able to see your

111
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,199
comments a little easier than we were on

112
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,060
live

113
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
so this is sort of like the new thing

114
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,319
we're gonna try

115
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,159
um for lack of a better way to go about

116
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,839
it

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
so

118
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,099
um we'll just try to

119
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,819
[ __ ] for a while and get uh where we

120
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,800
can on some of this stuff so

121
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,459
I don't know where we want to begin I

122
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,978
thought maybe this thing would be good

123
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:53,758
to talk about like some some seed bank

124
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:55,500
history yeah the you know obviously like

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
now uh there's a lot of stuff that's

126
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,918
kind of coming out of the woodwork where

127
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,860
people are talking about a lot of famous

128
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,258
old cuts from the 80s and 90s seed lines

129
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,720
and all that and I thought that like

130
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,580
there was a bunch of people that didn't

131
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,880
uh maybe didn't know some of the history

132
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:13,859
behind all how all that occurred uh and

133
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,439
so obviously since it's weed history

134
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,720
it's not entirely exact but this is

135
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,560
everything we're going to talk about is

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,580
the best that we know it right so uh

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
there could be some different

138
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:26,639
information not everything could be

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,639
entirely correct but we're going to give

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,680
it our best shot to give you uh what we

141
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,579
think and what we know and all that

142
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,319
right

143
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:37,319
that is correct

144
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,560
so that's the word so the reason why we

145
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,500
wanted to start with um like sort of

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,180
Neville and sort of Holland history uh

147
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,279
is it's that's not where like seed

148
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,259
history started obviously like there was

149
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,819
stuff going on in California there was

150
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,400
sacred there was plenty of private

151
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,579
breeders but

152
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,679
um in Holland that was sort of the first

153
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,680
place where you could literally be a

154
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,639
nobody and just send them money and get

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,579
seeds

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,259
right yeah like kind of in California at

157
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,939
least from my knowledge and experience

158
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,520
you kind of had to know somebody you

159
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,079
kind of had to be connected a little bit

160
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,079
um you know you had to be within certain

161
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,579
circles uh for instance you know I grew

162
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,560
up in the Midwest

163
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,538
and there was no access to seeds there

164
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,399
was no culture or anything like that so

165
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:27,300
the only places that we knew how to get

166
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,859
weed were dead shows and Holland

167
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,978
um and so you could mail order from

168
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,960
Holland you could uh you could fly out

169
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:37,079
there and buy them direct and kind of

170
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,779
try to bring them back yourself so

171
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,418
to me that's kind of where like modern

172
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:46,799
weed history as far as like most

173
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:48,359
people's access to it begins yeah if you

174
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,340
were in certain circles if you were in

175
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,759
the Pacific Northwest I mean you know

176
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:57,299
obviously it starts before that but

177
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,080
um Neville put an ad in High Times and

178
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,500
84 or so and that started what Matt's

179
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:07,318
holding up right now is his 85 catalog

180
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,720
um and because Holland's

181
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,819
because Holland's laws had changed then

182
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,100
they were sort of the first place that

183
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,300
could like really make seeds available

184
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,160
to everybody

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,860
right

186
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,599
so as a result of that like that's where

187
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,699
a lot of people got

188
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,379
most of their seed stock

189
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,000
um it wasn't from connections it wasn't

190
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:32,579
from friends that those were small

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,079
groups uh you know Neville uh sssc

192
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,839
um you know a couple other small places

193
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,879
they allowed everybody people from

194
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,560
Florida people from Chicago people from

195
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,339
New York people from North Carolina

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,199
Virginia wherever to just if they had

197
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,538
the balls to go there they had the balls

198
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,660
to order it they could get it

199
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:53,699
right and so that's where

200
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,699
that's where kind of like our modern

201
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:59,340
story starts and that's where like a lot

202
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,020
of uh a lot of seed strains and a lot of

203
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:05,638
lines that became famous to everybody

204
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:07,799
like Hayes Northern Lights skunk one G13

205
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,120
Maple Leaf all these things we talk

206
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,379
about now that'll become kind of

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,780
legendary

208
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,579
it's really where like 99 of the

209
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,459
population really first started getting

210
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:20,339
access to it right

211
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:23,038
um and so Neville is kind of unique in

212
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:26,038
cannabis history in that he had the

213
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:28,459
balls to start it and he sort of got to

214
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:31,978
as as you know by the mid-80s

215
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:33,718
persecution in California and America in

216
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,598
general had really kind of ramped up it

217
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,419
was the Reagan years uh drug laws had

218
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,520
gotten intense and so a lot of a lot of

219
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,740
breeders and a lot of Growers and a lot

220
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,699
of guys were seed they sort of took what

221
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,220
they had and they fled uh to Amsterdam

222
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,120
right and so Amsterdam basically got

223
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,040
famous because it was able to collect a

224
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,899
lot of stuff that was going on in

225
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,159
America and not so much stuff it was it

226
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,139
had itself

227
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,458
but really stuff that was going on in

228
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,500
America

229
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,259
um they did do some trips it's certainly

230
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,179
true that uh Neville

231
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,039
um the dronkers from Scentsy other

232
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,199
people you know some people went to

233
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,699
Afghanistan there was [ __ ] that they

234
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,860
called obviously the hippie hashish

235
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,778
Trail where people started going to the

236
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,440
Far East and poking around looking for

237
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:24,299
seed stock and stuff and uh but Holland

238
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,339
is really where it Consolidated like

239
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,139
Matt's holding it up right now if you

240
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,899
look on the left page that he has up

241
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,299
there's like an order form right and you

242
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,519
could literally write down what amount

243
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,439
you wanted of what strains and you could

244
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,500
send them [ __ ] money and they would

245
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,019
send you seats and uh that was pretty

246
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,480
revolutionary I think because that had

247
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,060
never happened before you couldn't just

248
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,519
ask a stranger for a bunch of a bunch of

249
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,079
illegal marijuana beans and get a hold

250
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,139
of them back then

251
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,000
right and so we thought maybe it would

252
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:00,179
be good to start like on a historical

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,600
basis because most of the stuff that we

254
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:06,179
grow today in some way there's a lot you

255
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,700
could trace a lot of it back to that

256
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:12,359
first five or ten years in Amsterdam say

257
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:15,420
like 85 to 95 right yeah I think Matt

258
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,639
would agree absolutely the vast majority

259
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:20,759
of today's modern cannabis you can at

260
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:24,120
least tie some of it back to that era

261
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:26,580
most of it definitely yeah you know and

262
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,039
so Neville did two things right Neville

263
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,980
had the balls to start

264
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,899
and then secondly he was kind of able to

265
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,700
collect a bunch of people's previous

266
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,940
work

267
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:44,759
um like for instance Mel Frank uh Jim

268
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:48,000
Ortega uh Seattle Greg from the NL crew

269
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,860
um you know uh Sam Skunk Man various

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,379
groups like that and then his own

271
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,079
travels and so he kind of became the

272
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,419
first person to be able to blend all

273
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,458
those things together like before him

274
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,919
nobody was crossing skunk in Northern

275
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,299
Lights because the skunk crew and the

276
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,958
Northern Lights crew didn't know each

277
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,199
other

278
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,179
nobody was crossing nl5 you know with

279
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,079
Haze because those that crew didn't know

280
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:15,359
each other yes in a way he got lucky

281
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:16,379
because I mean like imagine today for

282
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,500
instance

283
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:22,559
you could collect nobody knew about Kush

284
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,500
nobody knew about cookies nobody knew

285
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,059
about Sour nobody knew about all these

286
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,339
things that are famous in America and

287
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:31,739
imagine you got to be the person that

288
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:34,019
Blended them together first

289
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,320
and then sold and then resold them to

290
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:39,060
people so like that's kind of like what

291
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,940
um that's kind of what Neville got to do

292
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,958
in a sense right is yeah he got to be

293
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,579
first

294
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,439
you know and a bunch of people copied

295
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:49,139
him and a bunch of people came along and

296
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,240
added their own thing and obviously like

297
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,000
just like every other breeder

298
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,980
nobody started [ __ ] right everybody

299
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,039
happens on the shoulders of who came

300
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,200
before him so you all pick up you know

301
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,059
the breeding projects and the clones and

302
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,820
the seeds as you get into weed as you

303
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,739
come around and then you know you kind

304
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,600
of add your own kick to it and that's

305
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,519
what every breeder has done you know

306
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,100
from the beginning

307
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,000
um in some cases the first breeders in

308
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,980
say like America uh were taking all the

309
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,799
import lead like the Colombian and the

310
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,220
Panamanian and the Thai and the Mexican

311
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,620
and all that and all that stuff came in

312
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,540
uh from seed you know seeded weed

313
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,179
so literally every time you bought weed

314
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,879
you got free seeds

315
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:38,159
um and so most most breeding in America

316
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,559
was a bunch of sativas

317
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,439
right because that's all there was was

318
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,479
sativas like if you got Hash Hash was

319
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,519
Afghans but you didn't find any seeds

320
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,980
for the most part in hash

321
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,778
I think this this is a really super

322
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,420
important part too because most people

323
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,820
that are around today don't realize that

324
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,919
the the influx of modern afghanis and

325
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,440
stuff happened more in the 80s late 70s

326
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,699
early 80s as opposed to have always been

327
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,800
existing and always a part of the

328
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,778
culture yeah it it changed I mean most I

329
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,879
would say for instance that like most

330
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:15,419
most things that people were growing in

331
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,740
the 70s was a blend of sativas yeah

332
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,799
because that's what that's what

333
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,720
everybody had access to right so you

334
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,059
know it'd be Mexican Colombians it'd be

335
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,820
Mexican Colombians and ties it'd be all

336
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:29,819
these type of things and Afghans were

337
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,680
super [ __ ] rare like really rare

338
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,200
um because somebody had to go to

339
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,019
Afghanistan or Pakistan or one of those

340
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,240
regions get seeds and they had to go in

341
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,159
the 60s and 70s when travel took a long

342
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,720
time right they had to go they had to

343
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,639
collect them and they had to smuggle

344
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,700
them back into America either mailing

345
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,879
them or on their person somehow right so

346
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,940
but there was literal tons and tons and

347
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,620
tons of Mexican and Colombian and Thai

348
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,620
and Panamanian and all these different

349
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,659
Jamaican that was coming in and you know

350
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,039
in bricks and stuff to America and it

351
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,699
was all seated

352
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:08,699
so you know uh that was kind of like the

353
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:12,240
and so as a result of that most American

354
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,300
breeding was like in core groups right

355
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,039
it was just little groups of people

356
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:18,599
friend groups extended friend groups

357
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:23,159
that type of thing

358
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,560
you know uh and you know so that's kind

359
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,799
of how it started and it really I mean

360
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,500
it really wasn't until Holland that most

361
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,778
of America got access to like a what a

362
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,799
lot of little groups of people were up

363
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:36,299
to doing

364
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,759
you know

365
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:41,939
um obviously like prohibition was pretty

366
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,620
heavy so you know you just there was no

367
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,800
way for you to know what what Seattle

368
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,419
Greg and the NL crew was doing in the

369
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,819
Pacific Northwest they were trying to

370
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:52,740
avoid getting busted yeah and they were

371
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,839
they and Greg's commented several times

372
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,759
that it was just like watching dominoes

373
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,980
fall constantly watching their friends

374
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,659
get popped it was sketchy and so as a

375
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,579
result of it being sketchy and you

376
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:04,259
trying to be underground right

377
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:05,698
that meant that most people didn't have

378
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,198
access to what you were doing because

379
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,539
they didn't want most people to know

380
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,879
what they were doing they had to in

381
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,740
order to be successful you know there

382
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,778
was there was you know some stuff going

383
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,720
on in Mendocino County and Humboldt

384
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:22,198
County and you know Santa Cruz and the

385
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,060
Central Coast Area that was mountainous

386
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,919
um and you know people were getting away

387
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,138
with pretty good sized things and

388
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,059
breeding and stuff but unless you were

389
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,220
connected to those Crews if you lived in

390
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,439
Nebraska if you lived in Florida if you

391
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,000
lived in you know Chicago like where I

392
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,339
was born or anything like that you had

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,220
zero access to those people

394
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,260
you had no idea whatsoever what was

395
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,959
going on you just had you know if you

396
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,720
were lucky you got some imports so

397
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,819
the reason why we thought uh starting

398
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,000
with Neville and starting with the seed

399
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,980
banks is because Neville was really

400
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,100
Neville was probably one of the biggest

401
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:02,399
reasons why we're all here

402
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,440
uh he sold between he had when he

403
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,480
started the seed bank

404
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,440
um you know he sold millions of dollars

405
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,399
worth of seed millions of dollars yeah

406
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,500
all over America all over and so what he

407
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,720
did is he gave thousands and thousands

408
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,159
and thousands of people the ability to

409
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,199
grow their own

410
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,600
and the ability to get some of the best

411
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:28,379
American genetics that were happening

412
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,560
that people didn't have access to before

413
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:34,799
um so you know in a way

414
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:38,039
um you know he kind of took a lot of

415
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,078
very famous weed characters and he made

416
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,719
their stuff famous

417
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,698
you know is really kind of what happened

418
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,980
he made it famous yeah that's he made

419
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:48,599
some rock stars you know so I was

420
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,000
talking about it before and if anybody

421
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,060
was listening to like uh you know the

422
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,820
first breeder Syndicate uh interview uh

423
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:59,698
Matt Matt and Kanza got to interview

424
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,740
um uh Seattle Greg and one of the things

425
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:03,000
that Seattle Greg said in that interview

426
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,298
was that

427
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,459
you know he sent uh Neville a whole

428
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:10,619
bunch of NL seed because he saw that

429
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,939
advertisement that Neville put in that

430
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,938
in High Times

431
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,160
uh he literally you know reached out to

432
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,900
Neville and

433
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,459
um you know he sent Neville Northern

434
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,280
Lights

435
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,620
um and you know within five or six years

436
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,439
of that time uh everybody in the

437
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,879
northern light crew has gotten busted

438
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,080
um and it would have been lost a time

439
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,780
and nobody would have known anything

440
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,220
about it other than some Legends

441
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,160
um but he had gotten it to Holland

442
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,160
before they all got busted and lost it

443
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,880
right so

444
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,640
um

445
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,020
you know there's a there's a thing when

446
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,520
people are asking questions I haven't

447
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,079
gotten to the questions yet because I

448
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,538
just been kind of rapping about stuff

449
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,558
but

450
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:54,058
there's a button where you can people

451
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,639
can go and they can ask questions and

452
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:57,839
we'll try to get some of those questions

453
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,820
answered a little bit later after we

454
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,678
roll through some of this [ __ ]

455
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:05,339
and so

456
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,980
you know I'm I'm in my mid-40s so

457
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:10,379
you know literally like I said before I

458
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,259
knew how to get seeds I knew how to get

459
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,720
good weed from Grateful Dead shows and

460
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:22,140
Holland and uh I went to Holland in 1994

461
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,940
and uh you know I was able just as an 18

462
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,820
year old nobody to just walk into

463
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,679
various places and buy seed stock

464
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:30,359
you know I didn't know anything about I

465
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,880
knew barely anything about growing weed

466
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,099
I literally got my first seeds that I

467
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,900
had access to because I could buy a

468
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:40,019
plane ticket and I could fly to

469
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,400
Amsterdam as a kid and I could buy seeds

470
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,019
and I could bring them back to my spot

471
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,679
and we could pop them

472
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:48,798
and uh we could see what's up was it

473
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,660
still super expensive for the time like

474
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,400
you know like modern times comparatively

475
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,840
how were the seed prices back then when

476
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,100
you first flew over did you have to save

477
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,740
forever or

478
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,839
so the funny part about it is is that

479
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:04,440
um seed prices like when you look in

480
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:06,298
those old catalogs yes check it out in

481
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,298
all honesty you know you see a lot of

482
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:11,579
stuff for 50 bucks 80 bucks 150 bucks

483
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:13,619
200 bucks ever

484
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:14,759
you have to realize the way money works

485
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,538
right now

486
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,038
um

487
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:20,400
like I'll just give you guys for an

488
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,720
example of inflation in 1994 when I

489
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,519
turned 18

490
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,700
20 back then would be worth 38 today

491
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,700
foreign

492
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,038
ly stable over the decade

493
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:37,558
they really haven't jumped because if

494
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,839
you think about it most if you were

495
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,599
selling seeds at what Neville was

496
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:45,298
selling seeds for most seed packs should

497
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,798
be between two to four hundred dollars

498
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:48,900
yeah yeah

499
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,819
um just just even to equate how much

500
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,220
actual money Neville was getting for

501
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:56,038
selling those seats right

502
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,360
and so you know they've stayed pretty

503
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,700
stable I mean obviously there's some

504
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,859
people there's some there's cookies uh

505
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,600
there's some uh when Skittles came out

506
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,339
there's some people that

507
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,199
really profited off people's

508
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,038
availability

509
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,679
um

510
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:13,200
and uh you know they've charged you know

511
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,900
500 800 a thousand dollars a pack for

512
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,120
certain beans but

513
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,940
um you know seed prices for most things

514
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:24,359
like if you buy stuff from CSI or you

515
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,759
buy stuff from uh Riot or you you know

516
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,579
other good breeders that uh you know we

517
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,379
like like Shaw and different people

518
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:36,240
um they're amazingly competitively

519
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:38,640
priced uh you know to today so

520
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,558
um that's kind of like the that was kind

521
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,840
of a long-winded way to basically say

522
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,940
this hour or some chin change or however

523
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,759
long we decide to shoot the [ __ ] is

524
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,320
basically about like maybe giving some

525
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,379
people some information about how

526
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,779
Neville got started and how he collected

527
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,419
things and then how he started blending

528
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:01,500
things and then how those things sort of

529
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:03,179
became like the Bedrock of modern

530
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,679
cannabis

531
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,500
right

532
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,780
um because he's the guy that really took

533
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,400
it from very few hands relatively

534
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,740
speaking

535
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,780
um to crowdsourcing it if you will to

536
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,538
use a modern term where all of a sudden

537
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,759
a ton of people had access to it

538
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:22,140
right and I don't think that would have

539
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,140
happened

540
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,960
um without Neville and some others and

541
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,679
Holland and all that so

542
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,819
um

543
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:34,980
maybe that's sort of the uh that's sort

544
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,298
of the beginning

545
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,579
you know

546
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:40,558
um and we can kind of walk it through so

547
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:43,619
Matt right now is holding up the first

548
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,658
actual real Seed Catalog which has a

549
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,879
bunch of cool pictures of Neville's

550
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,440
Afghanistan trip

551
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,780
um you know he's holding a bunch of his

552
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,860
sheesh he's hanging out with people in

553
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:57,960
the tribal regions of Afghanistan and

554
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:59,879
um you know so basically when when

555
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,319
Neville first started

556
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,080
uh

557
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,480
he didn't know [ __ ] of what he had right

558
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,519
there it is yeah he really didn't he

559
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,440
didn't know anything that he had he was

560
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,599
just collecting stuff from people right

561
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,600
and he was starting to blend to those

562
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,759
things and I would say it probably took

563
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,079
him about three years or so of [ __ ]

564
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:24,419
around

565
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:26,279
um 85 84 85 86 going into 87 before he

566
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:29,640
really started to figure out like what

567
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:33,960
he had and favorites of what he had and

568
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,000
then kind of like 88 89 90

569
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,340
um that really when like the blend

570
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,700
started happening that ever that got

571
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:44,399
made really famous like if you look in

572
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,038
um if you look in the book the very

573
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,019
first book

574
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:51,179
you know in the Northern Lights

575
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,798
Greg and those guys sent him like

576
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,580
Northern Lights labeled one through

577
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,639
eight

578
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,619
but he you weren't able to buy nl1 from

579
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,259
him you couldn't buy nl2 you couldn't

580
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:05,339
buy NL anything you bought a random

581
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:08,579
assortment of NL that he had because he

582
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:11,220
hadn't had time to like you know he

583
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,839
inbred those things line by line but it

584
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,600
took him a few years to really figure

585
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,339
out what he had or then Grow rooms of

586
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,939
the stuff and even see what was in there

587
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:23,459
you got to realize too that like to him

588
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,558
these are just names that are coming in

589
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,819
from these different Growers

590
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:28,319
um you know we have a lot of knowledge

591
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,658
about what these things are supposed to

592
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,240
be now but he didn't have any

593
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,039
so in the first couple years there was a

594
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,220
bunch of there was a bunch of stuff in

595
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,099
there that's weird uh in for lack of a

596
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,380
better term you know there's random

597
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:46,500
Nepalese by skunks you know Colombians

598
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,720
by this Africans

599
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,819
yeah you know there there was just a

600
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,380
bunch of stuff because he was sort of

601
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:55,439
reselling

602
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,260
uh everything you know everything that

603
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,880
he had and he didn't really have uh he

604
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:02,279
didn't really have a way to

605
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,980
differentiate that you know so he was

606
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,779
just experimenting so you'll see a lot

607
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,099
of weird things in there like there's a

608
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,740
page

609
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:15,119
um you know yeah he's got some some Tie

610
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:18,179
by uh by uh Afghani you know New Mexico

611
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:22,439
Afghani yeah he had stuff that you'd

612
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:24,780
never see again like skunk one by by nl9

613
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,538
I think or nl8

614
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:30,418
um he had Mazar Missouri that he got

615
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:33,200
from his travels to Afghanistan he had

616
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:36,179
Nepalese

617
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,058
Rooter Alice it was kind of just a grab

618
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,100
bag in the beginning of

619
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:42,599
just whatever whatever you know he's

620
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:45,418
kind of collecting from all these

621
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,399
different breeders right and um

622
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:50,820
so uh

623
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,679
you know they um you know and you know

624
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:54,599
and and also just to go back for a

625
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,159
second just to give people an idea so he

626
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,178
was collecting all that

627
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,880
uh Greg Greg Seattle Greg sent him uh I

628
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:05,100
believe NL one through eight

629
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,460
uh according to Neville

630
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:10,918
um and Greg and uh you know who keep

631
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,079
David Watson who people call Sam's skunk

632
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,960
man he had gotten in trouble a couple of

633
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:19,079
times and so he took a bunch of seed

634
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,298
stock from himself uh and then some from

635
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,699
some other breeders and he brought that

636
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:27,179
to Holland and he ended up selling it to

637
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:31,380
uh Neville uh he ended up selling it to

638
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:33,500
uh the owner of positronics

639
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,500
um

640
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:41,339
the owner of positronics Bernard

641
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,440
um he ended up just basically you know

642
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,298
he had a couple kids or whatever he was

643
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,360
kind of brokish

644
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:51,960
um and he ended up going out there and

645
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:55,139
he gave Neville skunk one and Hayes from

646
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,419
himself and then he was friends with Mel

647
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:01,380
Frank and Mel Frank had given him

648
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:03,059
Afghani one and Durbin poison

649
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,020
um and then another breeder in the Bay

650
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:09,899
who we don't know his name had given

651
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:14,038
um some some other afghans

652
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:16,798
and stuff like that and so 85 86 Neville

653
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,960
was basically just reselling a bunch of

654
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,879
stuff that he was collecting a bunch of

655
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,740
different breeders that he had gotten in

656
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,220
touch with you know people who had flown

657
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,419
out from America to Holland or had

658
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,298
reached out to him through his

659
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,580
advertisement like Greg did and started

660
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:35,940
making connections right

661
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:38,220
uh so that's kind of like the that's

662
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,140
kind of the um

663
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,000
that's kind of the beginning

664
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,340
really

665
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,900
um so I don't know I've been talking for

666
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,959
a while I don't know if Matt if you want

667
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,820
to throw in uh any comments onto that or

668
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,500
we want to start back and forth on some

669
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,720
stuff but well

670
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,339
um let's let's start going over some of

671
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,900
the baselines that came out of the the

672
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,879
seed bank area some of the bass lines

673
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,140
that we see in a lot of modern cannabis

674
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,140
lines today

675
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,059
all right so maybe we'll start maybe

676
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,580
we'll start with uh something simple

677
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:11,460
like Northern Lights yeah but like I

678
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:15,240
said if you look in the 85 catalog and

679
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,759
you look in the 86th Vlog I'm not sure

680
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,038
maybe even the 87 but my memory fails me

681
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,558
slightly I think you really can just buy

682
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,480
Northern Lights yeah this one says

683
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,700
cannabis Indica Northern Lights in the

684
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,380
86 and in 87 it just says cannabis

685
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,900
Indica Northern Lights as well just as

686
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:34,020
Northern Lights so he got it in 80 he

687
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,880
placed that ad in 84. he got the seeds

688
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,400
sometime in 84. it's not we're not

689
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,980
exactly sure when yeah

690
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,600
he kept he started growing them out and

691
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,599
he started keeping the lines separate

692
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,778
and interbreeding them right and so if

693
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,599
you guys listen to the podcast with Greg

694
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:54,480
McAllister uh Seattle Greg as we like to

695
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,240
call him and um

696
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,679
you know he basically said that like you

697
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,240
know the nl1 and the nl2 and the nl3

698
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,120
um those were all pretty predominantly

699
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,120
Afghan they were rated by height and

700
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:12,359
length of flowering time and then most

701
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,079
of the other most of the other NLS were

702
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,879
those couple Afghans either one or two

703
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:21,778
blended with basically every sativa they

704
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:25,640
could get their hands on Hawaiians

705
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:28,380
um you know uh Colombians ties

706
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,759
Mexicans so it was really a hodgepodge

707
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,039
and

708
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,679
Greg has mentioned that they were really

709
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,839
scared to keep notes uh and they were

710
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,179
really scared to like lay out exactly

711
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,599
what they were doing so a lot of those

712
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,900
lines are kind of lost to time in terms

713
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,759
of what their exact makeup is uh because

714
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,259
those guys didn't even want to keep

715
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,379
track they were just trying to find good

716
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:53,640
weed right so yeah some of them is a

717
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,159
mystery but if you look in those first

718
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,000
few catalogs like I said before you can

719
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,080
find

720
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,099
you know uh skunk one by NL nl9 you can

721
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,519
find

722
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,439
um you know five by eight if you will uh

723
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,440
you can find a bunch of different things

724
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,000
and he started reading them together and

725
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,919
combining them

726
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,778
you know in various in various different

727
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,220
ways and even in the beginning right

728
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:19,319
like

729
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,058
um everybody's familiar most people are

730
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,619
familiar with what he ended up using

731
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:27,599
which is one of the things that became

732
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:29,699
pretty famous which is nl5 by nl2

733
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,819
um but the first year he offered it he

734
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,880
reversed it and he and he and it was nl2

735
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:40,079
by nl5 uh because he hadn't really

736
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,340
decided yet on like what you know what

737
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,678
worked for him

738
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:48,058
so after a few years of [ __ ] around

739
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:51,419
with NL he basically realized that

740
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:53,879
um nl1 bred pretty true to itself it was

741
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:56,940
pretty close to what we call Steve

742
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,720
Murphy Afghan uh which is basically The

743
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,000
Afghani that sort of got the NL line on

744
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,519
its way he got these Afghan seeds from

745
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,619
this guy named Steve Murphy uh who wrote

746
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,220
a couple cannabis books in the mid 70s

747
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:14,819
and this was sort of a wide leafed short

748
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,399
squat kind of bubble-like

749
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:20,278
um lowland Afghan

750
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:24,359
leafy Frosty resinous

751
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:29,460
short uh quick flowering thick dense

752
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:31,798
that type of thing and then the nl2 was

753
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,620
um you know more of a cush type it had

754
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:37,319
thinner leaves uh one thing that people

755
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:39,778
should know is like Afghanistan has an

756
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,240
enormous amount of height variation

757
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:44,519
depending on where you grow so some of

758
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,558
the stuff like the mazars and some of

759
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,839
the regions might only be like one or

760
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,460
two thousand feet above sea level but

761
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:54,359
then when you get up into like the Hindu

762
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,980
Kush region the Hindu Kush region is the

763
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,019
second highest mountain range next to

764
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,538
the Himalayas and a bunch of those

765
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:03,538
Afghan farmers were growing at like six

766
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:06,359
thousand eight thousand feet these big

767
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:09,599
tall valleys in the middle of nowhere

768
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:12,778
and so those leaves were kind of much

769
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,699
skinnier much thinner think about like

770
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:17,278
everybody's pretty familiar probably

771
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,860
with like the way that like what modern

772
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,140
Kush looks like and it's like that

773
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:24,479
skinny three leaf

774
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,700
um you know with different nugs

775
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,700
um where like the lowland Afghans were

776
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:33,899
sort of like thick feathery

777
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,278
um denser looser more more leafy nugs

778
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:37,979
like Matt's holding up in the picture

779
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:41,278
right there right yep so

780
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:44,700
I think it's 89 is it 89 the first

781
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:48,240
catalog mat where all of a sudden he had

782
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,019
figured out which NLS really worked for

783
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,480
him

784
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:53,700
which ones were stable which ones gave

785
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,759
him good breeding work and after getting

786
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,940
all those NLS all the NLS pretty much

787
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,558
disappeared okay from Neville's catalogs

788
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,860
except for

789
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:08,278
he offered nl1 F3

790
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:10,939
he offered nl2

791
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:10,940
okay

792
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,839
and then he found

793
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:18,058
he grew up a bunch of five and since

794
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,000
five is so famous maybe we'll chat about

795
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:22,319
that there's this dude named Kirby who

796
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,519
uh

797
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:29,939
um who took uh Steve Murphy's Afghan and

798
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:32,579
he crossed that to a Hawaiian which he

799
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,440
said was a Colombian by Mexican right

800
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:37,500
and

801
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,140
um you know and he gave that to Greg and

802
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,179
Greg sent that seed line out as one of

803
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,740
the one through eight well never Neville

804
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,380
grew a bunch of that out and obviously

805
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,538
if you're growing a bunch of Afghan by

806
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:52,580
Colombian by Mexican you're going to get

807
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:55,558
a bunch of uh a variety and Chaos okay

808
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:58,379
so he found this one maybe if you want

809
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,158
to show that one an L5 pick again yeah

810
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,159
let me find it

811
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:07,798
within the first few years

812
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:11,460
he grew up a bunch of this nl5 and most

813
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:14,519
of it was a chaotic mess uh Afghani

814
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,200
sativa blend all over the place but that

815
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,599
picture that you guys are seeing on the

816
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,179
left you found this one he called it

817
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,740
like a throwback plant right and he

818
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:26,820
found this one plant that was almost

819
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:31,919
pure Afghan super Frosty super resinous

820
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:34,918
didn't taste like much super low Terps

821
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,778
um but it uh it had great structure it

822
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,380
had a great Buzz

823
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:43,259
and uh he loved it and so I think by 88

824
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,778
89 90 the only thing that Neville was

825
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:47,038
really breeding with was you could buy

826
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:50,220
nl1

827
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:54,000
you could buy nl2 and he had one cut

828
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:56,399
that Matt just showed of the nl5

829
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,898
right yeah you gotta realize for a

830
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,678
second that

831
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:03,839
in America right guys they didn't have

832
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,600
Neville's nl5 cut

833
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,598
they sent Neville a cut of their

834
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:12,539
favorite but theirs was a hybrid theirs

835
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,000
was that blend it was an F1 hybrid of

836
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:17,699
Steve Murphy Afghan by Colombian and

837
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,579
Mexican right

838
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:23,519
and so you know there was there's a lot

839
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:25,759
of confusion about nl5 and we have this

840
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,918
thing that we call pre-pre

841
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,899
where a lot of people like to like to

842
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,398
talk about how they have seeds or they

843
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:35,039
have Cuts like from the earliest

844
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,719
possible time you could have the cut

845
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,960
but people need to people need to

846
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:43,019
understand that there was always

847
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,179
um there was a North American cut of nl5

848
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,159
that was an Afghani hybrid of with

849
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:50,519
sativa and there was a cut that Neville

850
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:52,079
found amongst the seed line that is that

851
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:57,420
picture right there that looks super

852
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:59,460
Afghan and super Frosty right and so

853
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,400
um by 88 89

854
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,880
almost all the NL you're gonna get is he

855
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:10,619
used nl1 and nl2 as males

856
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:13,500
and nl5 was always the this the female

857
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:16,920
and that was pretty much it after three

858
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,260
four years of breeding with NL he had

859
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,900
decided that most of the sativa most of

860
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,240
the hybrids that were with sativa that

861
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,920
Greg had sent were a [ __ ] mess and

862
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,979
hard to breed with and didn't breed

863
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,559
consistently right and you got to

864
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,900
realize too that back then during the

865
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:36,480
high prohibition times people wanted

866
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,720
consistent producers yeah that's

867
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,119
important he used the joke that if he

868
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,399
gave you some kind of white hot fire but

869
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,358
it yielded 10 percent less you'd be

870
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,660
pissed

871
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,779
yeah right and so most he found that

872
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:53,279
like most pure Afghans didn't cross very

873
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,079
well together

874
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,160
um they like being crossed with that was

875
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,619
one of the he was one of the first

876
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,299
people that really realized that when

877
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,160
you start Crossing things you start

878
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,539
getting really neat stuff when you start

879
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,159
Crossing things that are totally

880
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:08,219
unrelated to one another

881
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:11,399
ah so

882
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:14,519
the NL that everybody became famous with

883
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,019
people should realize there never was an

884
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:20,699
nl5 line that was ever released pure

885
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:22,320
that's super important as well because

886
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:24,239
we see that all the time people popping

887
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,820
up with nl5 saying they have the nl5 cut

888
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,519
or nl5 seeds so

889
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,039
you know the nl5 cut that was made

890
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,739
famous because people were buying

891
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,119
millions of dollars worth of hybrids of

892
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:38,039
it really

893
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,740
that was in Europe

894
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:44,159
you know and you know Greg has stated

895
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:46,439
that by the late 80s they had all gotten

896
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,199
busted and lost all their [ __ ]

897
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,358
right and they didn't really share very

898
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,000
much Greg told us that they had shared

899
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:57,059
the eight a cut of the eight a cut of

900
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,579
the nine and with a few friends they had

901
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:01,980
shared the five cut but that wasn't the

902
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,320
super Afghani five cup Neville shows in

903
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:07,320
those pictures that was the F1 hybrid

904
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,500
that was Colombian Mexican and Afghan

905
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,320
right so

906
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,260
um everything that never sold

907
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:21,599
was an nl5 hybrid

908
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:26,579
you had nl5 by nl2 he had no five by uh

909
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:29,400
skunk one he had nl5 by Haze uh can you

910
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:33,180
think of any more Matt

911
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:36,420
um as far as nl5 crosses final five Haze

912
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:39,480
nl5 by two I think that what was the

913
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:42,539
other one in all five one

914
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,179
those are three most common right yeah

915
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:48,119
yes you know a lot of people are talking

916
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:50,179
about having pure nl5 well that'd be

917
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,980
really [ __ ] hard

918
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:55,618
because Greg says that they lost it all

919
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:59,599
by the late 80s and then Neville never

920
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:03,480
sold pure nl5 uh there and and by pure

921
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,820
uh to be clear he grew out a lot of the

922
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,639
seeds that Greg sent him and most of the

923
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:12,119
nl5 line was a mess and he found this

924
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,618
one Afghani plant he liked a lot and

925
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,838
that's the one he used

926
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,940
so

927
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:20,400
uh you know you see a lot of stuff you

928
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,500
know I see some comments you know uh

929
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,858
talking about Bodhi stuff and all that

930
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,320
and it's tough because I'm not here to

931
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:30,480
like you know call anybody out or

932
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,240
anything like that or obviously there's

933
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,179
a lot of people making a lot of claims

934
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,679
um but you know that's part of the issue

935
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,480
and that's part of the reason why we

936
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,460
wanted to do these podcasts and these

937
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,539
talks is because most of the history is

938
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,780
oral

939
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:47,358
right it's not written down very well

940
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,839
um even the people that were there

941
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:53,880
disagree exactly on what happened yeah

942
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:56,759
right there's some consensus but there's

943
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,858
also uh there's also some disagreement

944
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,599
and some of these Old-Timers they don't

945
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:03,838
like each other

946
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,160
yeah just flat out and they have beefs

947
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,259
and they have disagree I mean it's not

948
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:09,059
very different than today right there's

949
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,260
breeders today that don't like each

950
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:12,259
other and they have beaches

951
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,239
20 years from now there'll be legends

952
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,799
about both right and they'll be like Oh

953
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,118
I thought Matt Ryan was a piece of [ __ ]

954
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,740
he's a [ __ ] this and that I don't

955
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,420
believe him at all and then there'll be

956
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:26,338
other people who will be like well Matt

957
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,500
Ryan's story was consistent in this

958
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:31,739
other guy's story wasn't consistent

959
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:35,039
and most people aren't there right

960
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:37,439
and so what we're trying to do with this

961
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:42,300
is just kind of lay out some like basic

962
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,039
facts right and uh yeah and I can

963
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,900
actually comment on the Bodhi uh in all

964
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,639
five thing because I was we were talking

965
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,380
during that time a lot you know we've

966
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,480
been close friends for a long time and

967
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,099
in his goal with the nl5 knowing he knew

968
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,260
that nl5 was never released pure as a

969
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:58,740
seed line however we were trying to find

970
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,839
something closest that we could find and

971
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:02,338
he was like he was trying to find it and

972
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:03,838
and Consulting all his friends too

973
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:05,519
saying hey where do you think the best

974
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,619
nl5 seed line would be that would show

975
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,440
the best representation and at the time

976
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,420
there was like Dr Thomas Northern Lights

977
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,659
um which was a supposed claimant to the

978
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,940
nl5 you know uh lineage and then there

979
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:21,379
was BC seeds which was the more popular

980
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:24,119
one that had had been around probably

981
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,039
accepted as as closer to Northern Lights

982
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,900
than most that was available at the time

983
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:29,159
so that's what he went with and and I I

984
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,320
agree it was probably one of the better

985
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:33,299
options at the time but as far as a pure

986
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,700
NLP seed line when you break it down

987
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,859
it's that's really hard to find

988
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:40,559
because it never because the only people

989
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:44,219
that had it you know and by pure let's

990
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:47,159
be clear the initial nl5 seed line was

991
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:50,539
an unstabilized poly hybrid

992
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:55,500
yes it was a mixture of Mexican

993
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:58,019
Colombian and and Afghani right it was

994
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,559
never stabilized it was never pure it

995
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:04,079
never BR it never bred true right it was

996
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,460
a full-on polyhydrate

997
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,500
oh and that's right squirrel mentioned

998
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,500
the nl5 skunk one yeah that's correct

999
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:13,199
yeah no five I I mentioned I think

1000
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:18,480
Neville sold nl5x2

1001
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:22,139
NHL five by Skunk one yeah five by Haze

1002
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,760
um and so but NL was always the NL was

1003
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:26,159
always the mother plant

1004
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,200
yeah I'm sure most people know this but

1005
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:31,319
I'll say it anyway

1006
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:33,659
just in case is that the way we talk

1007
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,099
about seeds is the mother should always

1008
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:37,500
come first

1009
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,500
and the father should always come second

1010
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:45,539
correct you talk about five by two he's

1011
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:48,000
using the mother of nl5 and a dad of nl2

1012
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:49,559
right uh some people get it flipped

1013
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,320
around and that's hella confusing

1014
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:54,299
because it is important to know what's

1015
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,099
the mom and what's the dad it really

1016
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,099
helps to have consistent terminology

1017
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:02,400
when you're chatting about seeds

1018
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:04,260
um what about the new cut so

1019
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,599
you know there's things where it's like

1020
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,339
I can't you know

1021
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,140
when we're talking about kind of seed

1022
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:12,420
history and stuff like that this is all

1023
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:14,279
stuff that's going on in the 80s and the

1024
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,380
early 90s

1025
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,859
um and then you know these these things

1026
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,780
get legendary status and then they pop

1027
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:23,940
up in different generations and by

1028
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,339
different people and different seed

1029
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:30,179
companies in Holland different seed

1030
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:34,019
companies and later in Canada they start

1031
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:35,879
uh they start popping out and um

1032
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:38,699
I can answer that one actually real

1033
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,700
quick yeah so uh there's there's

1034
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:44,098
somebody asked a question about nl5 seed

1035
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:48,659
from Todd uh we know quite a bit about

1036
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:53,280
that uh the basic story is that Greg

1037
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:54,659
says okay that he found that that they

1038
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,119
found some seed

1039
00:42:54,659 --> 00:43:00,118
from him that he didn't know existed for

1040
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,260
decades uh after his sister had sadly

1041
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,660
passed away

1042
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,300
in her fridge in her freezer in her

1043
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:10,199
freezer and he gave some of those to

1044
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,880
Todd uh Matt got some of those as well

1045
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:15,000
um and

1046
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,780
um so those you know it's it's hard to

1047
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,400
say uh you know Greg admitted that uh

1048
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,640
Greg admitted that he lost everything

1049
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,619
for decades and then he finds some seeds

1050
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:29,879
in his sister and his deceased sisters

1051
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:31,980
uh fridge uh that were labeled and so at

1052
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,599
best you can say that the provenance of

1053
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,300
them is uncertain

1054
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,300
for sure you know it's just uncertain

1055
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,180
there's just no way to tell if it is an

1056
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:45,359
L5 then it would be

1057
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:48,358
Steve Murphy Afghan by

1058
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:51,420
Mexican Colombian which which originally

1059
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:53,400
Greg referred to as a Hawaiian but later

1060
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,318
on he said what the Hawaiian was that

1061
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,539
was actually over there it's a Hawaiian

1062
00:43:55,318 --> 00:44:00,659
but you know I mean obviously Hawaii

1063
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:03,900
doesn't have any native exactly weed so

1064
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:06,179
most of Hawaiian was sativas from other

1065
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,619
traditional regions brought to Hawaii

1066
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:10,799
and grown

1067
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:13,858
yeah right yeah and so how did BC Seed

1068
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,260
Company obtain nl5 so this is kind of

1069
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:19,739
jumping around for a minute but let's be

1070
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,819
clear uh most of the seed companies in

1071
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:24,419
Amsterdam

1072
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:26,159
once they realized how profitable this

1073
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,818
seed [ __ ] was

1074
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:32,578
they would buy seed from whoever had the

1075
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:35,519
seed in Holland rename it and resell it

1076
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:38,160
yeah okay so

1077
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,559
um you know a company bought Neville's

1078
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,078
nl2 F3

1079
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,599
and they renamed it Oasis

1080
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,780
yeah uh which company is that Matt

1081
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:52,200
remind me uh Dutch Passion Dutch Passion

1082
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:54,060
so Dutch Passion you know uh when this

1083
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:56,279
is jumping ahead a lot but you know

1084
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:58,559
within a year of Shanti releasing white

1085
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,140
widow or other things there was two or

1086
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,480
three other competing seed companies in

1087
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:04,739
Holland selling White Widow and they

1088
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,079
would just take this they would just

1089
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:09,719
lift the exact lineage from the people

1090
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,240
that's that first sold the seed they'd

1091
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,818
buy five or ten or Twenty or however

1092
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,279
many packs of seed from that person grow

1093
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:18,719
them out pick a male and a female and

1094
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,380
start making and packaging their own

1095
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,098
seed line because it was money

1096
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,838
right

1097
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:27,300
so

1098
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:28,559
these things are just reworked you know

1099
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,900
and

1100
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,460
one thing that we should also know

1101
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,619
is uh

1102
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,539
seeds have always been Shady

1103
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:38,460
and everybody involved in seeds has

1104
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,559
always been shady and it's already

1105
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:44,159
always been Underground

1106
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:48,239
and it uh you know it's always been

1107
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,858
somewhat persecuted and so you know a

1108
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,078
lot of the characters to be perfectly

1109
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:54,358
honest live

1110
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,318
and it's hard to tell what they lie

1111
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:56,940
about

1112
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:59,338
you know

1113
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,019
um yeah I mean the provenance of a

1114
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:02,818
breeders only as good as

1115
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:04,500
what they can prove you know and a lot

1116
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:06,358
of people don't demand that proof they

1117
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,480
don't know to demand that proof or or

1118
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:11,880
have it even researched to demand yeah

1119
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,440
well I saw something we'll get to some

1120
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,700
questions here and just we'll go through

1121
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
like a little question and answer

1122
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:18,899
session

1123
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,220
um you know shortly here or whatever and

1124
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,318
we're not we won't get through it all

1125
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:24,000
today but I just kind of like you guys

1126
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:25,800
can see I mean I haven't even gotten I

1127
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,159
haven't even talked yet about the most

1128
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:32,339
famous hybrid of all time which is nl5

1129
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:35,338
haze but there's a lot of depth to these

1130
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:36,358
stories on how these people got started

1131
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:39,420
um and you know and then other people

1132
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:42,358
should also know that like you know

1133
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,519
um some of these later seed companies uh

1134
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:48,539
a lot of these people worked for Neville

1135
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:52,559
right yeah uh Adam who was part of

1136
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:54,300
starting THC seeds Tony who was first at

1137
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,119
cerebral and then made his own sag

1138
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,720
Martha seeds Simon who was also at

1139
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:03,119
cerebral and then made serious seeds uh

1140
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,818
they all were boom

1141
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,760
right all of them and then within a year

1142
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:10,920
of leaving working for Neville or

1143
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,140
leaving working for Scentsy under

1144
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,000
Neville to be more accurate they all had

1145
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:18,480
their own Steed companies

1146
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,900
so it's highly likely that at the very

1147
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,179
least they took some stock uh some other

1148
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:28,740
plants some fathers some whatever from

1149
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:30,719
their previous job and rename stuff uh I

1150
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:32,459
mean that's the game right uh it's

1151
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,379
always been a meaning

1152
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,318
it's always been

1153
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:40,140
get something

1154
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:43,139
right yeah it's never been

1155
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:45,059
um you know but maybe I should take a

1156
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:46,318
step back I'll talk for a few more

1157
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:48,559
minutes and then we can answer some

1158
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:48,559
questions

1159
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:52,799
but the other part that's cool is that

1160
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,419
one of the things that Neville did that

1161
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,180
other people didn't

1162
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:00,440
is that he actually went to America on

1163
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:03,419
some even clone hunts

1164
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,099
and uh there's a dude who is written

1165
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,380
most people probably know exactly who

1166
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:09,359
this is uh he's one of the people

1167
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,920
through his books that taught me how to

1168
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:12,179
grow weed there's this dude named Jorge

1169
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,079
Cervantes

1170
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:19,379
and uh Neville met up with Jorge

1171
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:22,140
Cervantes on one of his trips back into

1172
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:25,740
America and

1173
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:27,779
um Jorge got had new breeders maybe

1174
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:30,299
breeders is the wrong word they knew

1175
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,540
Growers at the very least they knew

1176
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:37,019
growers in the Pacific Northwest region

1177
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:39,420
and Jorge hooked him up with the G13 cut

1178
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:41,579
and what what became known as the

1179
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,380
Pacific Northwest hash plant

1180
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:44,579
that's right

1181
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,838
um

1182
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:48,119
and so

1183
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,559
certain people gave Neville a bunch of

1184
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,480
seed lines

1185
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:55,799
but then there was things like the

1186
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:57,539
Pacific Northwest hash plant the G13

1187
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,880
um you know stuff like that that ended

1188
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:02,818
up just being straight cuts that he

1189
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,858
purchased uh and

1190
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:07,318
um you know

1191
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:09,659
yeah George wasn't somebody he used to

1192
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,059
go buy a different pen name

1193
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:15,500
um back in the day

1194
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:18,480
uh but uh yeah he he hooked up Neville

1195
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:22,199
with those two cuts and really all we

1196
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:25,318
know is that Neville paid 500 for the

1197
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:27,838
G13 cut and it came out of order

1198
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:30,539
and he I don't know how much he paid for

1199
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:33,539
the Pacific Northwest hash plant I'm not

1200
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:36,300
sure but he paid for that and he sent

1201
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:37,199
both those things back as cuts

1202
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,000
right

1203
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,399
so

1204
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,559
um you know he kind of collected over

1205
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,740
the first five or six years he was in

1206
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:48,599
business through some travels uh to

1207
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:51,959
Afghanistan from meeting up with

1208
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:54,180
American breeders uh to going to to

1209
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,380
going to America and buying cuts and

1210
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:57,118
Seed lines

1211
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,000
we haven't talked about that but there

1212
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:03,960
was this uh very mysterious character

1213
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,940
named Jim Ortega that gave him seed

1214
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,019
lines that became Super Famous the

1215
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:13,260
garlic Bud the Hawaiian Indica the

1216
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:13,920
um the maple leaf Indica

1217
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,880
um

1218
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:21,358
and uh uh the Kush four

1219
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,280
uh you know and those ended up a number

1220
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,139
of those ended up in a bunch of Neville

1221
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,780
projects

1222
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:30,179
um so Neville kind of like Neville kind

1223
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:33,000
of like was able to in that five-year

1224
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:36,019
period you know our six year period

1225
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,099
really 84 to 90. he was constantly

1226
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:40,318
collecting stuff from breeders

1227
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:42,780
collecting stuff from people blending it

1228
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,400
together releasing stuff playing around

1229
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,640
with stuff and seeing what the hell it

1230
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,480
was is kind of how it got started in a

1231
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:51,900
sense

1232
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,818
uh you want to add any of that [ __ ] Matt

1233
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,318
um actually this this is hearkening back

1234
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:57,960
to people are asking about the BCC

1235
00:50:55,318 --> 00:51:00,838
company and their sourcing I actually

1236
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,119
found something in reference to just

1237
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,739
that real quickly is it the doctor

1238
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,079
Atomic one so there's gonna be the hemp

1239
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:08,879
BCC bank I believe and they don't really

1240
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,220
give an exact

1241
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,260
um anything on how they sourced it but

1242
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:14,699
it does say uh this state-of-the-art

1243
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,839
Indica as a result over 20 years of

1244
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:18,899
selected inbreeding they pretty much

1245
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,639
took levels uh description the buds have

1246
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,818
extremely frosted then they actually

1247
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:27,000
sold an nl5 Hawaiian Indica no5 Haze one

1248
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:28,558
Hawaiian Haze but again it didn't see

1249
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,760
anything about the sourcing of their no5

1250
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,800
and they couldn't have possibly been

1251
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,040
around for it

1252
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,619
so that's a lot to digest and it kind of

1253
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:41,400
gives you like a super General overview

1254
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:42,900
of like what what Neville was up to and

1255
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,639
you know some of the people he was

1256
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,440
collecting from and some of the things

1257
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,659
that he got

1258
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,659
um maybe we'll pause for a second and

1259
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:53,578
we'll hop over to the votes uh yes

1260
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:55,858
people are and we'll answer some

1261
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,420
questions yeah I'll read them off to you

1262
00:51:55,858 --> 00:51:59,818
so you don't have to read them no I got

1263
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,619
them in front of me it's pretty easy uh

1264
00:51:59,818 --> 00:52:03,539
this app that I downloaded works pretty

1265
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,400
well awesome

1266
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:09,960
the first question that got a bunch of

1267
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:13,680
votes is uh getting CSI on here

1268
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,199
um CSI is I could probably safely say

1269
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,818
he's a good friend of both mine and

1270
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,879
Matt's

1271
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:22,500
um we both uh chat with him uh fairly

1272
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,039
often

1273
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,838
um you know he uh we're all good friends

1274
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:29,699
uh it's certainly possible that we could

1275
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,380
convince them to come on one of these in

1276
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:33,078
the future

1277
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,818
um

1278
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:37,280
he's not quite as talkative as Matt and

1279
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:40,079
I am and he's lost

1280
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,700
but he has done it in the past and it is

1281
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,180
entirely possible that we could get him

1282
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:47,239
to do it uh he's a wealth of knowledge

1283
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:50,639
um people call him inspecta for a reason

1284
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:53,098
uh he's got a really curious mind he

1285
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:55,259
pokes and pokes and pokes and tries to

1286
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:59,160
figure out knowledge kind of like

1287
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:01,980
the rest of us everything I just said

1288
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:04,618
um that I rambled on about for forever

1289
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:08,159
uh that it's the result literally of

1290
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:11,099
years of talking to people uh a year of

1291
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:14,539
researching years of you know uh Matt

1292
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:18,000
got to talk to Neville quite a bit in 09

1293
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:20,759
uh 10 12 years ago

1294
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,338
um or so got a bunch of emails and

1295
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:27,059
various kinds of communication uh there

1296
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:30,179
was a couple year period on uh Mr Nice

1297
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:32,220
forums which is Shanti Baba's site where

1298
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:33,799
Neville was actively posting and

1299
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:36,598
answering a bunch of people's questions

1300
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,780
uh there's friends of his that have

1301
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:42,960
contributed uh there's enemies of his

1302
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,000
that have their own various stories and

1303
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,338
stuff and so

1304
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
um all this stuff is not easy to find

1305
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:55,019
it's not in any one location it's all

1306
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,719
sort of a conglomeration of uh

1307
00:53:55,019 --> 00:54:01,219
you know it's a lot of a lot of work and

1308
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:04,639
you know CSI

1309
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:04,639
it crashed

1310
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:10,079
he puts a lot of effort he cares about

1311
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:13,439
history he cares about

1312
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,400
um knowledge uh he cares about the oral

1313
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,059
history

1314
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:21,660
I can't say when but we can try to get

1315
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:24,000
uh homie on here and see if he wants to

1316
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:27,058
chat about various things

1317
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,219
the next question is we have like I said

1318
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:31,220
before we have no idea who passed the

1319
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:34,699
Pacific Northwest hash plant to Neville

1320
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:36,598
do you know that

1321
00:54:34,699 --> 00:54:38,460
jorgeous

1322
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,380
yeah that's right Jorge did arrange that

1323
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,818
that exchange for the pnw hash plan

1324
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,818
right he did he did

1325
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,539
your team

1326
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,099
um so it's not public knowledge who gave

1327
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,739
it to him we just know it came out of

1328
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:55,500
the Oregon Washington state area uh

1329
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:57,539
there was Growers that that Jorge knew

1330
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,119
that he was able to hook up with Neville

1331
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:03,480
and Neville bought them from them

1332
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:06,740
um so uh their names are not known to my

1333
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:11,338
knowledge uh whoever they were

1334
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:13,858
and uh the Maui cut that I have

1335
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:16,318
so the the third that question and the

1336
00:55:13,858 --> 00:55:18,838
next question what seeds did I buy in 94

1337
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:21,058
and did I find anything decent and the

1338
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:24,960
Maui cut are both related

1339
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:27,900
so I was Dumb and I was 18 and in

1340
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,639
retrospect I went there and I bought a

1341
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:33,358
ton of seed

1342
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:36,179
but sadly I only bought one or two packs

1343
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:39,000
of like 15 different things

1344
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:41,098
um and not realizing at the time that I

1345
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,679
would have been better off buying say

1346
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:46,140
two or three or four things like five or

1347
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:49,259
six or seven packs of each

1348
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:53,098
um and actually get like 20 or 30 or 40

1349
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:54,900
females of each one instead you know I

1350
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:57,838
bought a bunch of random [ __ ] I bought

1351
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,940
stuff from Scentsy uh I bought some

1352
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:01,139
stuff from

1353
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,960
um

1354
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:06,539
I'm trying to think now uh this the

1355
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,940
easiest way to put it is uh I didn't

1356
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:11,639
find anything that was worthwhile on

1357
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,940
that trip except for

1358
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:16,920
I was at the gray area coffee shop and I

1359
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:19,200
was smoking a joint and we were young

1360
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,720
and this old timer was sitting down next

1361
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,098
to us and I mean old timer in the sense

1362
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:25,618
he probably looks something like me

1363
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:28,859
right now he was probably in his mid-40s

1364
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:31,019
a little a little gray whatever and uh

1365
00:56:28,858 --> 00:56:32,338
we were smoking and we were young we

1366
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:34,019
were all 18 I was there with some

1367
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:36,480
friends of mine we were like all 18 to

1368
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:39,300
20 or whatever and we were all hippies

1369
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,818
deadhead this mission to buy seeds and

1370
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,280
smuggle them back so we could grow I had

1371
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:47,639
a I had I had a huge scene I had a two

1372
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:51,599
lighter at the time so really major

1373
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:54,299
major player and uh

1374
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,099
um I was sitting down next to him this

1375
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,200
this old guy smoking weed and we were

1376
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:00,000
telling him our story and he told me

1377
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:02,299
that he was from Hawaii

1378
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,219
and he'd lived there since the mid 70s

1379
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:07,318
and every few years he came out and

1380
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:08,639
traded seeds with some of these guys in

1381
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:10,318
Holland

1382
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:13,739
um and brought him back and tried them

1383
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:15,719
in Hawaii on Maui and it wasn't a very

1384
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:17,639
long conversation we drank a cappuccino

1385
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:19,318
I didn't ask him that many questions we

1386
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:21,719
smoked a couple joints together and a

1387
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:23,880
little hash or whatever and then at the

1388
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:25,679
end of it he was like well I'm super

1389
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,019
stoked you kids are out here trying to

1390
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,818
find some weed and he's like why don't

1391
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:32,039
you take why don't you try a little bit

1392
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:34,199
of what I do and he put a handful of

1393
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:36,480
seeds in my hand

1394
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:39,719
um and one of those became the Maui cut

1395
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,358
uh I stupidly didn't make any seeds

1396
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:44,159
uh that era I wasn't even attempting to

1397
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:47,279
breed yet I was just trying to find a

1398
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,199
good female to fill my two lighter so uh

1399
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,380
I didn't ask him any intelligent

1400
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:53,338
questions about it and so I called the

1401
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,460
Maui

1402
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:58,199
because that's the island it came from

1403
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,159
and that's the only thing I know about

1404
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:02,639
it

1405
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:05,279
so it's gorgeous though yeah so really

1406
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,960
uh the first time I went to Amsterdam I

1407
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,559
went to Amsterdam probably two or three

1408
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,780
times between 94 and 03 probably two or

1409
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,480
three times a year I went to like three

1410
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:17,519
cannabis cups in that time

1411
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,659
um and I would go mostly I would go in

1412
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,400
summer

1413
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:22,139
um but I would go I'd try to go a couple

1414
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,300
times a year and buy different seeds

1415
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:26,699
talk to breeders talk to various people

1416
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,220
learn as much as I could you've got to

1417
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:31,739
realize back then there was no forums

1418
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:34,500
everything was just in books information

1419
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:36,539
was pretty hard to come by

1420
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,059
um you know information was rudimentary

1421
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:41,400
really uh the the way the information

1422
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:43,440
flows now I wish that I could have

1423
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,900
listened to somebody like this to shoot

1424
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,119
the [ __ ] about weed but it was pretty

1425
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,380
hard to come across so

1426
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:52,140
um

1427
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,720
the only thing I found on my 94 trip and

1428
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:57,598
I kept for the gift

1429
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:01,318
everything I bought was I don't want to

1430
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:04,619
say it was bunk uh but my 18 my 18 year

1431
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:06,179
old knowledge I didn't keep any of it

1432
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:08,400
so

1433
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:10,500
um I still have that cut it's still

1434
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,180
grown in Mendocino County by others it's

1435
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,980
a great outdoor plant it has a bunch of

1436
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:16,460
it might be in some popular strains that

1437
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:20,699
are around nowadays

1438
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:24,000
it is definitely in some popular streams

1439
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:25,439
um and all that and uh you know so yeah

1440
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,798
I got

1441
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,559
um the first the first trip the only

1442
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:33,659
thing I found that was useful was a gift

1443
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,280
from a man I don't even know his name I

1444
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:36,719
smoked a couple joints with him I'd

1445
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,540
probably spend a total of 20 minutes

1446
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:41,699
with him drank a cappuccino got a

1447
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:45,058
handful of seeds in my palm

1448
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:47,519
boggled it back called it the Maui and

1449
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:51,900
uh that cut is

1450
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:54,239
27 years old this year that's so wild so

1451
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:57,420
it's uh it's certainly my longest held

1452
00:59:54,239 --> 01:00:01,078
cut I've had it my entire adult life

1453
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:03,180
uh it uh paid a lot of bills I brought

1454
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:06,420
it with me when I moved from Chicago to

1455
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:08,399
Mendocino County in 1998 I spread it out

1456
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:10,680
a little bit there

1457
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,240
um and it's uh

1458
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:13,618
it's been in a number of different

1459
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:16,078
things

1460
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:19,380
um I bred with it quite a bit

1461
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,440
um you know I gave some hybrids that I

1462
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:24,599
had made uh of Superdog which is another

1463
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,639
story that we've talked about before but

1464
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:28,160
super dog by Maui I gave a bunch of that

1465
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,960
to mandelbrot

1466
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:32,460
mandelbrot uh found afino in that that

1467
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,858
he called the truth

1468
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:39,000
and then he bred with it and some of his

1469
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:41,578
own lines and stuff and so she exists in

1470
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,099
various she still exists pure with me

1471
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:47,220
and some friends but she also exists in

1472
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:49,859
some other people's work she might exist

1473
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:52,798
in some pretty famous things at this

1474
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:56,639
particular time but that's kind of how

1475
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:58,440
cannabis is you know so

1476
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:01,019
um how long have we been talking Matt

1477
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,880
it's right about an hour um I got an

1478
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:04,500
idea I was gonna do a giveaway tonight I

1479
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,380
think probably since we're touching on

1480
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:10,139
the pnw hash plant I'll give away some

1481
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,599
of the seeds to the person who asked the

1482
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:15,298
question that got the most upvotes so

1483
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:17,700
whoever Billy is send me a Instagram

1484
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:20,039
message some of the pnw hash plant

1485
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:21,838
crossed the blue bonnet

1486
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,298
um so there's a couple more questions I

1487
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:24,980
could answer for sure

1488
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:28,500
um

1489
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:32,338
and uh we'll uh I can chat a few things

1490
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:34,380
so uh our friend uh flanville he said

1491
01:01:32,338 --> 01:01:37,279
what's my personal favorite clone or

1492
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:38,940
line to come from Neville's work

1493
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:43,079
you know

1494
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:46,858
the line is easy uh I I personally think

1495
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:48,900
the most famous uh hybrid ever made in

1496
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:52,139
the most successful cannabis hybrid

1497
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,240
that's ever been sold is Northwest 5 by

1498
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:56,338
Hayes

1499
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,259
um I think it's uh

1500
01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:01,380
yeah I don't think there's another

1501
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:03,480
there's another line that's more famous

1502
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:06,240
um if you're looking at

1503
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:09,139
um at the catalogs right there right up

1504
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:12,838
there on top in the 1990 catalog

1505
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:15,739
that picture of nl5 haze do we know

1506
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:19,679
which one it was eight it's A2 it's A5

1507
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:21,058
A52 852 yep there it is that's the

1508
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:22,259
mother of Neville's hate that picture

1509
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:24,059
right there that's the mother of

1510
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,640
Neville's Hayes

1511
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:28,680
um that cut is still alive uh it's both

1512
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:31,618
in Europe and it's floating around with

1513
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:32,219
the select few people in America

1514
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:35,579
um

1515
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:38,639
it's you know it was found in 89 or

1516
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:42,839
something like that so it's super old

1517
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:44,879
um and look at all that leaf resin damn

1518
01:02:42,838 --> 01:02:47,400
so yeah basically

1519
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,858
um you know he got you know it's kind of

1520
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,519
long but he got haze from uh Sam's Dave

1521
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:56,578
Dave Watson's Sam Skunk Man and he ended

1522
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:59,400
up Crossing it with some of his indicas

1523
01:02:56,579 --> 01:03:03,240
um Maple Leaf Indica uh called that

1524
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:06,000
silver haze he crossed it with G13 and

1525
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:10,858
he had G13 Hayes he crossed it with nl5

1526
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:13,079
that became and the nl5 uh I actually

1527
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:14,578
don't think there's another line as well

1528
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:16,920
as me thinking that it's the most famous

1529
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:18,839
and well-known line I don't think

1530
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,900
there's another line that has as many

1531
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:22,619
named Elites that still exist as that

1532
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,019
line

1533
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:27,900
yeah it'd be hard you'd be hard-pressed

1534
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:31,199
to find one there's probably four to six

1535
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:34,740
at least famous named Cuts in Europe uh

1536
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:37,259
that are nl5 Haze the pith the heights

1537
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:40,500
Haze the Cuban black Haze the dog [ __ ]

1538
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:44,420
the church uh all those are all nl5

1539
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:46,920
hazinos and they all come from 88 to 95.

1540
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:49,200
here's another picture from Scentsy

1541
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,720
though

1542
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:53,699
um it is

1543
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:55,439
uh it's probably the most it's probably

1544
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:58,679
the most famous line that anyone has

1545
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,260
ever made and there's literally 8 to 10

1546
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:03,058
to 12 cuts of it that are all have

1547
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,460
different names they're all Elites

1548
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:08,339
they're all still hoarded

1549
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:11,639
uh and exist on both in Europe and in

1550
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:15,599
America so I think it's by far the most

1551
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:18,598
famous cannabis hybrid ever made

1552
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,579
um since you have this beautiful one

1553
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:23,519
yeah that's super skunk since you see

1554
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:25,920
today is sadly probably bunk

1555
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:27,838
um yeah Neville worked for them that's a

1556
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,119
whole story in itself but Neville worked

1557
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:32,880
for them after he got busted and got

1558
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:35,160
they bailed him out of jail and they

1559
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,660
gave him a great deal of if we bail you

1560
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:37,679
out of jail you have to sell us your

1561
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:40,858
company

1562
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,899
oh uh he spent like he spent a good

1563
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:45,719
chunk of time in jail and they bailed

1564
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:48,900
him out and Scentsy seeds ended up

1565
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:51,598
absorbing uh the seed bank from Neville

1566
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:54,298
and the entire Neville as their top

1567
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:57,298
breeder so Neville went from owning the

1568
01:04:54,298 --> 01:04:59,400
biggest most successful Seed Company to

1569
01:04:57,298 --> 01:05:01,858
having the DEA after him spending about

1570
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,318
eight or nine months in jail and then

1571
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:05,940
having to go from being an owner to

1572
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:06,798
being the head breeder for different

1573
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,659
people

1574
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:12,838
and uh that's another story but they

1575
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:15,539
ended up renaming a bunch of his stuff

1576
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:18,000
um and so Scentsy for the first five

1577
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:19,920
years in the 90s for the most part

1578
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,079
um that was where Neville resided and

1579
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,099
made most of his themes and probably

1580
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:29,339
from 95 to 2000 they still had the vast

1581
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:30,599
majority of the original uh lines that

1582
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:35,279
they were working with

1583
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:37,019
uh seed laws changed in 99 and 2000 in

1584
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,040
Holland and most of the original

1585
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:43,920
breeders got raided and busted uh Ben

1586
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,838
and Alan dronkers are

1587
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,119
um Dutch businessmen for lack of a

1588
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,920
better term they will never admit that

1589
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:52,318
they lost a single plant from The

1590
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:56,039
Originals you can't get a word out of

1591
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:59,759
them that anything is different than uh

1592
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:02,639
it's ever been but most likely they lost

1593
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,619
a bunch of stuff and if I'm correct I

1594
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:05,818
think they farmed out most of their work

1595
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:09,059
to Spain

1596
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:11,940
they haven't made traditional versions

1597
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:14,579
of their seeds and in the the timeline I

1598
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,900
always go by is roughly 2005 2006 is

1599
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:18,480
going to be the last times you want to

1600
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:20,039
buy stuff from the majority of the Dutch

1601
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,980
seed banks because by then Nirvana

1602
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:24,960
[ __ ] all of them Greenhouse uh

1603
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:28,740
Scentsy they were all farming out to

1604
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,318
Buddha seeds and eventually telemota

1605
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:34,798
so basically yeah um

1606
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:38,038
then see sadly since he had about a a 10

1607
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:40,619
to 15 year run of having lit a lot of

1608
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:42,480
legitimate stuff I do think that there

1609
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:43,559
could be some things in Scentsy that are

1610
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,500
still real

1611
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:48,059
you have no idea what to know what and

1612
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,699
we do know

1613
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:52,440
um that they lost uh quite a few mother

1614
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:54,480
plants and breeding plants over the

1615
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,619
years but they'll never admit that so

1616
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,219
sadly

1617
01:06:55,619 --> 01:07:01,500
it's no longer what they were in the 90s

1618
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:03,358
which was an excellent place to get a

1619
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,858
bunch of beans

1620
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:07,858
um

1621
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:09,298
and I will say uh see if if people want

1622
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:12,239
to see what original Haze is like

1623
01:07:09,298 --> 01:07:14,940
seedsman still has original Haze that

1624
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:17,038
they sell I believe uh it's all it's all

1625
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,798
purchased from Watson if I'm correct but

1626
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,180
if you know people talk about you know I

1627
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:23,159
might have a cutting of original Haze

1628
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:26,118
and stuff it's still around it's still

1629
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:26,118
around in seed form

1630
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:30,720
um

1631
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:31,558
you know so yeah there's I don't know

1632
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:33,779
there's

1633
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:34,680
we could talk endlessly

1634
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,420
um

1635
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:39,000
uh

1636
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:41,159
there's a couple things on here that are

1637
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,440
that are easy to talk about somebody

1638
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:46,858
said that skunk VA head dog use your

1639
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,659
headband cut uh yes and no I have two

1640
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:51,179
headband cuts

1641
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:53,038
um one of them we call the LA he does

1642
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:56,098
not have that one but there's another

1643
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:58,140
headband cut that's extremely nice uh

1644
01:07:56,099 --> 01:08:03,838
that both him and

1645
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:06,420
um ICC uh uh uh both have and

1646
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:08,578
um Mr Bob Hemphill and some other people

1647
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:11,159
have it's much more of a cush-based

1648
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:14,599
headband and that's the headband that

1649
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:17,278
that he uses it's a great cut super

1650
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:19,440
potential that's the one that I use as

1651
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,660
well from Elite cannabis

1652
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,159
yeah and then

1653
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:24,960
um

1654
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:27,778
let's see

1655
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,179
uh you mentioned the nl5 seed line was

1656
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:31,859
composed of Afghani Colombian and

1657
01:08:30,179 --> 01:08:33,960
Mexican what makes this different than

1658
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:36,359
skunk one

1659
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:39,060
um that's a good point skunk one is

1660
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:41,039
Afghani Mexican and Colombian just

1661
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:43,500
totally different types of parents

1662
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:45,298
totally different lines yeah I mean it's

1663
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,880
it's like saying somebody's Italian

1664
01:08:45,298 --> 01:08:50,278
Irish and Chinese you know it's not the

1665
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,259
same parents uh it's just the same

1666
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:54,839
region of origin

1667
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:59,039
um certainly Sam Skunk Man was not using

1668
01:08:54,838 --> 01:09:00,659
the NL Cruz Afghans in his lines

1669
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:03,659
um and it's very unlikely that the

1670
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:06,439
Mexican or the Colombians are related

1671
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:09,479
um but it just goes to show how

1672
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:11,099
different blends you know from different

1673
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,238
parents can lead to very different

1674
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,920
things

1675
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,479
yeah

1676
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,659
vastly different

1677
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:22,858
vastly different you know

1678
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:25,318
um let's see somebody asked about I

1679
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:27,719
don't know I mean I've been talking the

1680
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:31,980
whole time and Matt has been unusually

1681
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:33,420
quiet while I [ __ ] so I I learn I

1682
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:35,278
still learn when we talk there's certain

1683
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,838
things that you said tonight that I

1684
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,400
couldn't [ __ ] remember

1685
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:39,899
um even even from being the one who

1686
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,939
talked to Greg a bunch I still couldn't

1687
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:44,159
remember some of that stuff so I'm just

1688
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:48,000
learning

1689
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:50,880
um so uh which which do you know which

1690
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,500
uh cut of headband Caleb's using let me

1691
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,179
let me ask this there was a guy that was

1692
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,399
talking about where can one find real

1693
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:58,380
old school strains and genetics

1694
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,000
why are all these pollen Chuckers with

1695
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:02,179
watered-down Herm genetics and trash

1696
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,679
gear getting the most attention

1697
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:07,800
all right so there's a couple comments

1698
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:10,199
on that uh for one thing

1699
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,119
um and this is common this isn't just

1700
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:13,919
for weed but

1701
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:15,599
um you know some people are really good

1702
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:19,199
at marketing

1703
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,159
right uh for lack of a better turn you

1704
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:23,460
know yeah

1705
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:25,679
you know there's a lot a lot of breeders

1706
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:28,679
um let's all throw it out there again

1707
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,840
right so if we get CSI on here in my

1708
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:33,420
opinion CSI is one of the absolute best

1709
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:37,020
breeders that's alive today and working

1710
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:39,600
hands down I think he the amount of

1711
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:42,060
breeding he does the amount that he

1712
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,760
shows his own work the amount that he

1713
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:46,739
constantly cracks entire rooms of seed

1714
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,079
that he has made and shows people what's

1715
01:10:46,738 --> 01:10:51,539
in the seed lines themselves almost

1716
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:56,340
Nobody Does that yeah right almost

1717
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:59,158
nobody shows as much of his own work in

1718
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:01,319
pictures and you can just watch him grow

1719
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:04,439
after grow after grow after grow after

1720
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:08,759
grow after grow on IG for years just

1721
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:10,559
posting tons and tons of pics of you

1722
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:13,860
know most readers don't test their own

1723
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,199
work at this particular time it's very

1724
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:18,658
rare testing your own work is time

1725
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:21,178
consuming the best way to make money as

1726
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:23,158
a breeder is to make the cross give it a

1727
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:25,800
killer name make some amazing Patrick

1728
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:27,420
packaging and then be like Masonic or

1729
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,640
something like that and like pump pump

1730
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,440
pump on IG and try to get a bunch of

1731
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,000
hype going

1732
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:36,059
um and growing it out and testing it

1733
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,698
takes time money energy space

1734
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,620
power bills you know all this different

1735
01:11:38,698 --> 01:11:41,219
stuff and so

1736
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:43,679
um

1737
01:11:41,219 --> 01:11:46,319
no but the reason why I mentioned CSI is

1738
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,940
because he is absolutely terrible at

1739
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:51,000
promoting himself

1740
01:11:47,939 --> 01:11:54,479
he is a phenomenal breed

1741
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:57,000
that doesn't really self-promote the way

1742
01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:00,059
other people do you know and so you got

1743
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,158
to separate marketing from Talent right

1744
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,960
the other thing I should say about that

1745
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:06,899
is that when people talk about term

1746
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:10,079
genetics people act like herbs are a bad

1747
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:12,059
thing right and so and they're not

1748
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:14,399
you know I said this on the live when

1749
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,080
Matt and I were chatting before anybody

1750
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:17,279
that thinks that Herms are bad is

1751
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:20,698
tripping

1752
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:22,619
yeah right perms are inconvenient in

1753
01:12:20,698 --> 01:12:24,899
today's Marketplace

1754
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:28,260
um obviously having seeds and stuff like

1755
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:30,658
that isn't the greatest so you know uh

1756
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:33,360
Herms are just a genetic trait that

1757
01:12:30,658 --> 01:12:35,519
enable a plant to create seed in the

1758
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:37,319
event that something weird happens and

1759
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,380
they don't get pollinated in order to

1760
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:42,479
continue the species right from a

1761
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,279
breeding perspective

1762
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:46,198
um they're quite convenient to the

1763
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:48,359
marijuana plant

1764
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:50,339
um from a seedless perspective where

1765
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:51,719
we're trying to grow since Amelia or

1766
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:54,900
whatever you know however you want to

1767
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:57,060
call it seedless they're inconvenient

1768
01:12:54,899 --> 01:12:58,859
um but but the marijuana plant did not

1769
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,679
develop with the idea that it was going

1770
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:04,679
to be seedless to it seedless is a

1771
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:07,380
failure yeah right a straight failure

1772
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:09,779
okay so you know it's trying to just

1773
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:11,880
like all other life it's trying to

1774
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:14,039
reproduce and survive

1775
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:17,460
right and

1776
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:19,619
you know just to be clear too there is a

1777
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,380
lot of the best cannabis out there

1778
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:24,960
that's bag seat

1779
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:27,179
okay straight back seat it's really

1780
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:31,500
humbling as a breeder that some of the

1781
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:34,020
best on the planet is accidents it sure

1782
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,719
is the chem dog came from a bag of weed

1783
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:39,540
bought at a dead show without seeds in

1784
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:43,140
that bag of weed we don't have chem dog

1785
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:45,779
sour was a multi-term accident

1786
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:47,760
okay the super skunk that everybody's

1787
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:49,738
hunting after and everybody wants and

1788
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,300
everybody's claiming to have rks and

1789
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:53,339
there's rks coming out of the woodwork

1790
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:57,480
and everybody wants to claim like they

1791
01:13:53,340 --> 01:14:00,600
got skunk skunk skunk that plant permed

1792
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:02,939
like a mofo it harmed like crazy

1793
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,679
but because it harmed like crazy if it

1794
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:07,019
didn't hurt there would be no sour

1795
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:11,699
diesel

1796
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:15,600
right there would be Sour Diesel is is

1797
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:18,119
from accidental harms right the reason

1798
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,400
why people have Kush the reason why cush

1799
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:23,279
came to La is because in Florida

1800
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:26,099
somebody's room hermed and they sold

1801
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:28,619
seeded weed and people found that seeded

1802
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,539
weed and they grew up some seed and they

1803
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:33,238
got what we known as Kush

1804
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:37,140
Sour Diesel cookies

1805
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:38,339
okay uh chem dog you name it they're bag

1806
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:41,640
seeds

1807
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:44,520
and so you know a lot of people like you

1808
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,900
know jump on Herms and obviously you

1809
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,219
don't want to buy a bunch of gear that

1810
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:49,799
has tons of Herms because it's

1811
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:52,020
inconvenient but Herms are a genetic

1812
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,719
trait like anything else and they exist

1813
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:58,199
and breeders do the best they can to

1814
01:14:54,719 --> 01:15:00,739
reduce the incidence of Herms but if

1815
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:04,259
you're breeding something okay nobody

1816
01:15:00,738 --> 01:15:06,119
you know nobody cared that Sour Diesel

1817
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:09,539
hermed a little bit

1818
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:12,599
it was Fireweed yeah right tasted great

1819
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:15,960
got you super [ __ ] high lasted a long

1820
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:18,900
time burned great it's a Herm

1821
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:23,399
you know Kush came from a Herm cookies

1822
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:25,379
came from a herb multiple Hermits so a

1823
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:28,439
lot of the backbone cannabis and a lot

1824
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:31,319
of the absolute most famous lines were

1825
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:33,779
not created intentionally at all they

1826
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:35,939
were accidents that happened in people's

1827
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:37,619
rooms and so that doesn't mean that like

1828
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:40,319
you want to get a bunch of hermy gear

1829
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:43,679
that sucks and makes your life crappy

1830
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:46,859
right obviously Herms are inconvenient

1831
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:50,340
and breeders can do the best they can to

1832
01:15:46,859 --> 01:15:51,899
reduce her hermaphroditism traits but

1833
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:54,420
there's I mean Matt can speak to this

1834
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:57,899
there's populations like Thai and other

1835
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:00,960
things where perms are like prevalent

1836
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:03,119
yeah I mean it really depends on which

1837
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,039
line you're running and it vastly

1838
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:06,840
depends on the room that the the parents

1839
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,760
were acclimated in that made the seeds

1840
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:11,219
if if you're if you're popping seeds

1841
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,840
from a grower that only predominantly

1842
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:14,520
makes seeds indoors and you want to run

1843
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,679
them all Outdoors probably not the best

1844
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,080
idea you know it's it's acclimation

1845
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:21,119
climate all that goes into it but

1846
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:22,738
intersex traits are here people have

1847
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,359
right against them for ever since people

1848
01:16:22,738 --> 01:16:26,819
have been breeding cannabis first and

1849
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:28,079
vanilla right but they're still here and

1850
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:30,238
there's they're not going anywhere it's

1851
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:32,939
a part of the the genome and you know

1852
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:34,259
man there's there's a there's a uh

1853
01:16:32,939 --> 01:16:35,939
there's a lot of there's a lot of

1854
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:39,119
questions I'll try to answer a couple

1855
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:41,519
more before we before we leave the last

1856
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,559
question is Caleb using the other

1857
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:49,020
headband cut

1858
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:51,780
um Caleb is CSI uh and uh CSI has both

1859
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:53,760
of my headband Cuts Like I said he's a

1860
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:55,439
real good friend of mine I trust him

1861
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,659
with my whole Library he can have

1862
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:01,139
anything he wants for me basically

1863
01:16:57,658 --> 01:17:03,539
um I love his breeding work uh you know

1864
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:06,119
nobody put the Mendo perps which I got

1865
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:08,340
lucky enough to crack nobody put more

1866
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:10,079
genetics out there of the Mendo perps

1867
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:13,980
and made it a permanent part of the gene

1868
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:15,779
pool more than CSI so he has both of my

1869
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:19,678
headband cuts

1870
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:22,198
um my La cut is a sort of a diesel type

1871
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:25,739
it's much more of a blend

1872
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:28,319
you know uh the other one is much more

1873
01:17:25,738 --> 01:17:31,139
of a Kush varietal they're both super

1874
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:34,079
potent they're both in my kind of top

1875
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:36,179
five or ten cuts that I possess

1876
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:38,579
um so he has both he hasn't had them

1877
01:17:36,179 --> 01:17:41,219
forever but he has started using them in

1878
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:43,738
various work and you can buy some of

1879
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:44,520
that work as we speak

1880
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:46,799
um

1881
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:49,739
Mr Nice I'll ignore that one just

1882
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:53,880
because it's a super long subject but

1883
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:55,859
the short version is that after Neville

1884
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:59,279
left Scentsy he started working with

1885
01:17:55,859 --> 01:18:01,679
Shanti Baba and they made they bread

1886
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:03,420
together for a while and the result of

1887
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:05,699
that breeding was super silver haze

1888
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:08,539
mango Haze Neville's Haze some other

1889
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:11,460
things and Neville was hurting for money

1890
01:18:08,539 --> 01:18:15,479
and uh he sold

1891
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:16,560
County for a good chunk of loot uh a

1892
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:17,879
quarter of a million dollars or

1893
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,340
something

1894
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:24,539
um most of his seed collection from the

1895
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:27,020
seed bank era uh in the 80s unreleased

1896
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:30,179
stuff various lines and things like that

1897
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:31,560
so Mr Nice

1898
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:32,940
um like a lot of people there's some

1899
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,620
people that believe that shanti's full

1900
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:36,500
of [ __ ] there's some people they believe

1901
01:18:34,619 --> 01:18:39,479
he's a shady character that he's a liar

1902
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,920
but it's indisputable

1903
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:43,500
that

1904
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:47,158
Neville gave him a lot of real parents

1905
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:49,079
and Neville gave him uh or sold him his

1906
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:51,479
seed collection

1907
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:53,100
um so there's not very many people that

1908
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:55,500
have indisputable evidence that they

1909
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:58,679
have a bunch of access to the old things

1910
01:18:55,500 --> 01:19:02,340
and he's one of them that being said

1911
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:04,319
there's no way to verify what he has and

1912
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:08,579
what he doesn't have and so there's a

1913
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:10,619
lot of debate on what he has and there's

1914
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:12,179
disagreement and some people think he's

1915
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:13,979
full of it some people think he's got

1916
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:15,840
all the white hot fire

1917
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:18,779
the truth is probably somewhere in

1918
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:21,420
between I'm sure he has some of

1919
01:19:18,779 --> 01:19:24,179
Neville's old work I'm sure he has a

1920
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:26,219
bunch of Neville's old seed it's hard to

1921
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:28,319
say exactly

1922
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:30,658
um what he currently has and what he

1923
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:33,000
doesn't but his provenance in being able

1924
01:19:30,658 --> 01:19:35,639
to access it I don't think is in dispute

1925
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,698
would you agree with that Matt oh yeah

1926
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:40,560
for sure I mean Neville Neville uh I

1927
01:19:38,698 --> 01:19:42,719
mean at the very end it's not talked

1928
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,219
about a lot but um he he felt like

1929
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:46,140
Shanti Baba might owe him some more

1930
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:48,239
money even though it wasn't in the

1931
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,039
agreement because he had done so well

1932
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:51,599
with Neville's line so Neville obviously

1933
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:54,000
felt that his lines were being used

1934
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,960
correctly and making tons of money with

1935
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,760
them

1936
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,000
there's another thing about Australian

1937
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:01,440
bastard cannabis at CSI I'll just say

1938
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,880
that real quick I don't know that much

1939
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:07,559
about it

1940
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:10,079
um you know CSI is a true breeder

1941
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:13,760
um he's really interested in freaks he's

1942
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:18,059
really interested in genetic uh Oddities

1943
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:20,460
and if nothing else ABC is extremely odd

1944
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:22,679
uh in the way that its leaves form and

1945
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:25,679
stuff like that and you know a lot of

1946
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:28,199
stuff right now is really bottlenecked

1947
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,359
people use the same 30 40 50 Cuts over

1948
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:31,619
and over and over again and so at the

1949
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:34,439
very least

1950
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:37,380
when you buy ADC work you're getting

1951
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:38,579
something that is genetically unique so

1952
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,980
far

1953
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:43,439
and he's certainly widening the gene

1954
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:46,079
pool of available cannabis

1955
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:48,119
Yeah by making it by making it available

1956
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:50,460
to the public

1957
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:52,380
um it is probably one of the first lines

1958
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:55,260
in a long time that's totally unique

1959
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:57,840
from what came before and it's valuable

1960
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,280
just for that and it's an ongoing

1961
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,679
project that he's putting a bunch of

1962
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:03,658
time into and I'm sure over the next

1963
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:06,658
three or four or five years we'll see a

1964
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:08,399
bunch more work from it uh Matt can

1965
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:10,019
comment on this too but he's really just

1966
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,420
been getting started with his own work

1967
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,760
on it yeah yeah

1968
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:16,140
um I see so many people get so mad every

1969
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,480
time he posts pictures of people

1970
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:19,739
actually genuinely get hurt feelings

1971
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,419
when they see this plant and they're

1972
01:21:19,738 --> 01:21:23,698
like oh my God what is that piece of

1973
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,960
[ __ ] you know it's it's surprising to me

1974
01:21:23,698 --> 01:21:27,000
because a lot of them claim to be

1975
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,039
breeders or or our seed makers and have

1976
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,300
companies but they don't see the genetic

1977
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:31,679
novelty in bringing in something

1978
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:33,840
completely new that hasn't really

1979
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,158
touched cannabis you know as far as

1980
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,380
modern lines

1981
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:40,019
yeah I mean there's there's a lot of um

1982
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,520
there's a lot of uh

1983
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,500
there's a lot like I said there's a lot

1984
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,080
of sameness I'll say this quickly too

1985
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:48,300
the way the breeding is gone the last 20

1986
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:50,698
years as soon as something becomes

1987
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,779
famous everybody crosses it to

1988
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:53,399
everything else

1989
01:21:51,779 --> 01:21:55,500
yeah so the amount of [ __ ] right now

1990
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:57,960
that has cookie in it cushion it Sour

1991
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:00,119
Diesel in it Skittles in it

1992
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,100
um you know you name it in it

1993
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:04,679
um stuff gets bread and bread and bread

1994
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:07,739
and bread and bread and bread to die

1995
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:11,640
um so to take say cookies and across it

1996
01:22:07,738 --> 01:22:13,859
with uh ABC is crossing it to a vastly

1997
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:16,199
different gene pool than anybody else is

1998
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:18,420
using and so who knows what might come

1999
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:21,419
of that that's the best part you don't

2000
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:23,399
know who knows in a few years where that

2001
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,619
might lead that might lead to Unique

2002
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:27,719
highs that might open up the gene pool

2003
01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:29,760
and make things pop out you're not

2004
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:31,500
expecting genetics

2005
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,480
and so people get on them about it

2006
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:35,219
because it's so weird

2007
01:22:33,479 --> 01:22:37,379
um but he's really just in the infancy

2008
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:39,658
of playing around with it but you've

2009
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:41,100
seen that he is

2010
01:22:39,658 --> 01:22:43,679
um you know he's been posting a bunch of

2011
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:46,440
pictures this last week of some of his

2012
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,219
work with the ABC

2013
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:48,719
um

2014
01:22:47,219 --> 01:22:50,399
and I don't know we probably how long

2015
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:53,158
we've been talking

2016
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:55,799
um we're at about hour and a half

2017
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:58,738
hour and a half

2018
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,480
um so I don't know I mean maybe you know

2019
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:02,158
I don't know you guys could like this is

2020
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:04,738
probably odd because I've been talking

2021
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:08,759
98 of the time for an hour and a half

2022
01:23:04,738 --> 01:23:10,678
it's all good I can hear it in my throat

2023
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:12,420
um but we kind of wanted to do this

2024
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:15,119
thing and maybe we'll do it like you

2025
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:17,158
know semi often or whatever we had this

2026
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:20,519
thought of kind of going through the

2027
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:22,799
seed banks and it's such a big subject

2028
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,000
um we really only touched on a little

2029
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,579
bit of the history we didn't really

2030
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,520
touch on Haze or skunk or Durbin or

2031
01:23:26,579 --> 01:23:31,619
anything from Jim Ortega very much but

2032
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,239
those can be for future things

2033
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:34,738
so

2034
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:36,198
um I don't know you know I don't know if

2035
01:23:34,738 --> 01:23:40,198
this is where we want to leave it Matt

2036
01:23:36,198 --> 01:23:43,198
yeah this is perfect dude

2037
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:45,658
so maybe this is perfect but you know if

2038
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:48,000
that's the case I hope everybody enjoyed

2039
01:23:45,658 --> 01:23:49,379
it uh you know I don't want to make it a

2040
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,319
forever thing

2041
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,880
um but we could do this pretty often I

2042
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,219
can certainly look through the questions

2043
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:59,400
and maybe maybe if your question doesn't

2044
01:23:56,219 --> 01:24:01,439
get answered don't despair maybe it'll

2045
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:04,019
give us an idea for a topic that we'll

2046
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:05,759
talk about on the next one so just if we

2047
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:07,860
didn't get to your question or you

2048
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,719
didn't see it happen doesn't mean it

2049
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:11,759
won't happen you can always ask it again

2050
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:13,319
or who knows you might even hear us

2051
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,820
talking about it on the next one because

2052
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:16,859
it was a good question and it just

2053
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:18,479
didn't pop up on the flow of things and

2054
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:20,219
there's also the patreon you can go to

2055
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:21,658
read your Syndicate patreon where me and

2056
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:23,279
not so always shoot the [ __ ] with a

2057
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:24,779
bunch of people that are a part of it

2058
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:26,460
you can ask questions all the time and

2059
01:24:24,779 --> 01:24:28,319
whenever we have time we go in there and

2060
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:30,960
pick at them and and try to break it

2061
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:35,340
down that's really true too

2062
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:37,859
um the uh it's on Discord uh and uh we

2063
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:39,900
have a we have a server there

2064
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:42,420
um you know and yeah you can you can

2065
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:44,579
directly message me on there I generally

2066
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:46,920
answer sometimes it takes me a minute

2067
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:49,260
because you know I do do things and get

2068
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,880
busy or whatever but Matt and I are both

2069
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:53,460
pretty active on there and we do

2070
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:56,039
[ __ ] a bunch and it's a lot easier

2071
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:58,980
to ask away and get responses on there

2072
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:00,899
so feel free to join that

2073
01:24:58,979 --> 01:25:03,559
um and really what all Matt and I are

2074
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:05,819
trying to do at this point is just get

2075
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,820
chunks of history and chunks of

2076
01:25:05,819 --> 01:25:10,319
knowledge out there to the larger public

2077
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:11,939
uh this is kind of our this weed life

2078
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:14,158
this is what we like to do is what we'd

2079
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:16,678
like to talk about you know and

2080
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:18,439
pontificate on or whatever so I hope

2081
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:21,840
everybody enjoyed it

2082
01:25:18,439 --> 01:25:23,099
and learned a couple things and I hope

2083
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:27,300
it continues

2084
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:29,219
and all that so uh yeah I think that's

2085
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:31,320
it I think we should cut it and we'll go

2086
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:32,939
from there yeah sounds good thank you

2087
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:34,679
everyone for showing up whoever Billy is

2088
01:25:32,939 --> 01:25:36,479
who asked that question that got the

2089
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:38,880
most up votes send me a message and I'll

2090
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:41,099
send you some pnw hash plant uh blue

2091
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:44,900
Bond if it's unreleased you guys thanks

2092
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:44,900
so much natto good time
